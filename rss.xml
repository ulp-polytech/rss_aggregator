To solve this problem, in this article, an inherent switching reallocated CPS-PWM is proposed for MMC. Based on arm current directions, switching states of submodules (SMs), voltage sorting and carrier sorting results, proposed method divides SMs and carriers into inserting and bypassing groups for each, enabling switching reallocation within these four cooptimized groups to inherently balance capacitor voltages. This effectively prevents additional switchings. Besides, most computations of the proposed CPS-PWM are logical operations implemented in FPGA, so proposed method can achieve reallocation frequency equal to sampling frequency. Unlike other CPS-PWM based methods for voltage balancing, the inherent switching reallocated CPS-PWM not only has superior converge speed in dynamic processes which accommodate a wide power range, but also has excellent balancing accuracy especially considering capacitance differences. Owing to appropriate reallocation principles, the proposed CPS-PWM has lower switching loss compared to existing carrier reallocation methods. Finally, the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method are validated by simulation and experiment results.</description></item><item><title>Current Sensor-Less Dead Time Distortion Compensation in Three-Phase PWM Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003407</link><description>Dead-time distortion is a typical problem in pulse width modulation (PWM) voltage source inverter (VSI). Accuracy in current polarity detection is a major issue in implementing dead-time distortion compensation successfully. This article proposes a power function-based current sensor-less dead-time distortion compensation technique in three-phase PWM VSI. The power function, when developed by applying instantaneous power theory (IPT) directly, may not be able to detect the current polarity accurately. This has been investigated in detail in this article. In the proposed technique, this problem is overcome by sensing and utilizing the pole voltage of the inverter and developing the power function for each phase using IPT with significant modification to make it applicable to each phase individually. There is no requirement of topological modification or additional hardware in the power circuit for implementing such compensation. This reduces the overall cost and complexity of the set-up. The scheme is capable of automatically correcting the dead-time distortion, even in case of online load change. The attractive feature of this scheme is its simple principle, allowing it to be implemented in low-cost digital controllers. Validation of the proposed compensation technique is executed in digital simulation and through experiments in laboratory.</description></item><item><title>Small-Signal Behavioral Model and Voltage Control Parameter Optimization for MMC Considering Internal Dynamics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10969575</link><description>The modular multilevel converter (MMC) has become a pivotal solution for renewable energy integration and HVdc transmission systems credited to its modular scalability, high efficiency, and low distortion. Nevertheless, the intricate internal dynamics, including circulating current and submodule capacitor voltage dynamics, have a significant impact on its control performance. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel equivalent impedance circuit model that incorporates coupled circulating current and capacitor dynamics to optimize ac voltage control for the MMC.

The proposed model enhances the accuracy of voltage control performance prediction compared to conventional models, enabling targeted controller tuning that improves voltage dynamic response and stability performance. Finally, detailed simulation and experiment results under various conditions verify the accuracy of the proposed model and the effectiveness of the control optimization strategy.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Electromagnetic-Structural Coupling Vibration Model of Wound Core Under SPWM Excitation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10973174</link><description>The modeling and analysis of transformer core electromagnetic vibration considering hysteresis and magnetostrictive effects are challenging multiphysical problems. For SPWM application scenarios, a new vibration-predicting method of the wound core based on electromagnetic-structural coupling model is presented. First, the magnetostriction neural network model based on time-domain characteristics (MNNM-TD) of core strips is established. Compared with the conventional Jiles&#8211;Atherton&#8211;Sablik (J-A-S) physical model, MNNM-TD can more accurately describe the features of the magnetostriction under SPWM excitation. Second, a variable-parameter J-A model based on the simplified Newton's method is presented to obtain the precise flux density distribution. Then, an improved electromagnetic-structural coupling vibration model is built, which is an anisotropic model that simultaneously considers core saturation, hysteresis, and magnetostriction characteristics. Finally, the proposed wound core vibration model is verified by experiments. Under SPWM excitation, the errors of the main components of the acceleration level spectrum are less than 1.65 dB. This article realizes the accurate prediction of the wound core vibration under SPWM excitation, which will contribute to the development of vibration suppression technology for the power electronics system.</description></item><item><title>ZVS Boundary Analysis and Optimization Strategy of Phase-Shift Values for Three-Level Dual-Active-Bridge Converters Using Harmonic Decomposition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10977021</link><description>The dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter, comprising a primary-side three-level neutral-point-clamped bridge and a secondary-side H-bridge, represents a promising topology for voltage conversion applications between medium-voltage dc and low-voltage dc.

The proposed model offers a more accurate and simpler alternative to the conventional minor-loop criterion and the generalized Nyquist stability criterion for studying the stability of a Droop-GFM converter, as it accounts for loading effects and uses only two transfer functions. Formulated in the $\alpha \beta$ frame, the model consists of only two balanced impedances, offering a clearer physical interpretation of the impedance asymmetry introduced by droop control, in contrast to dq-frame impedance matrix models. The model describes frequency coupling effects (the mirror frequency problem) across the entire frequency range, providing both a geometric and physical understanding of this phenomenon. It allows determination of the bandwidth of the frequency coupling region, and how this region changes based on the droop coefficients and the loading condition of the Droop-GFM converter. The theoretical findings are validated experimentally using a Droop-GFM converter in three distinct scenarios, including: weak power grid operation, a change in the droop coefficients, and a change in the power grid impedance.</description></item><item><title>Multifrequency Model of Dual Active Bridge Resonant Converters With Phase-Shift Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002737</link><description>The dual-active-bridge (DAB) resonant converters are a cluster of efficient bidirectional dc-dc converters. It is commonly a challenge to obtain the analytic expressions of the control-to-output transfer functions especially in multi-element resonant converters. In this article, the multifrequency modeling technique is adopted to derive the general small-signal model for DAB resonant converters with various resonant tanks. The analytic expression of phase-shift-angle-to-output-voltage transfer function as well as the general control block diagram of DAB resonant converter is obtained. It is interesting to see that the models are different depending on primary side phase shift or secondary side phase shift. To have a clear picture of the differences, order reductions of the models are conducted with the example of the DAB series resonant converter. Finally, the prototype of the DAB series resonant converter is built in the lab, and the phase-shift-angle-to-output-voltage transfer function is measured, which successfully verifies the validity of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Time Domain Analysis and Gain Curve Modeling of Fractional-Order Full-Bridge LLC Resonant Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003900</link><description>This article adopts fractional calculus and its Laplace transform to model and analyze the fractional-order full-bridge LLC resonant converter (FO-FBLLC), which aims to extend the topology to fractional-order domain and construct a FO dc model of FO-FBLLC.

The model represents the mosfet as an equivalent conductance and considers the effects of the switching junction capacitance as well as the gate drive circuit, on the transient behavior of the switching device.

However, commercial curve tracer instruments can only measure a limited range of conduction characteristics at low drain-source voltage biases. In addition, the long dynamic settling times intrinsic to commercial curve tracers introduce self-heating (SH) artifacts that compromise the accuracy of the resulting characterization data. These limitations prevent SiC mofsetmodels from accurately predicting dynamic switching events and short-circuit failures. Alternative characterization methods are difficult to implement, do not provide a holistic data set, and are susceptible to measurement and VTH hysteresis errors. This article proposes an advanced experimental conduction characterization approach that can accurately characterize SiC mofsets at high-voltage and high-current without SH or VTH hysteresis errors. The method provides lower-error measurements than commercial curve tracers at the same operating conditions while also expanding the characterization range to high voltages. The measured results encompass the entire I&#8211;V space and can be used to model SiC mofsets without combining data from multiple instruments. The proposed method is used to characterize and model a SiC half-bridge power module, which is shown to be more accurate than a model generated with commercial curve tracer data.</description></item><item><title>A Passive Lossless and Nonshoot-Through Soft-Switching High Power Density Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10976580</link><description>Soft switching technique is the main method to increase the inverter switching frequency and thus improve the power density, which is one of the current research hotspots. Inverter soft switching needs to operate in four quadrants, wide range, time-varying load current conditions, the realization of the more complex. At this stage, soft-switching inverters are mainly based on bridge circuits, and the intertwined soft-switching and shoot-through deadtime problems in bridge circuits are one of the difficulties in limiting the improvement of inverter switching frequency and power density. To solve this problem, a passive lossless and nonshoot-through soft-switching inverter is designed in this article, which fundamentally eliminates the constraints of shoot-through to soft-switching of the inverter. The four-quadrant operating mode is given, in which the high-frequency chopper bridge operates at unidirectional voltage and current conditions, thus achieving full-load range soft switching using passive coupled inductors. Increased switching frequency and the size of the filtering components is significantly reduced. This article analyses the specific operating modes, soft switching conditions, losses, parameters, and control methods. A 1-kW prototype is established, and the results of the experiment verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis. The prototype achieves the power density of 5.8 kW/L and the peak efficiency of 97.1% at 400&#8201;kHz.</description></item><item><title>Core Loss Calculation Method Considering Leakage Flux Induced Power Loss for Nanocrystalline Core High-Frequency Transformer Under Load Condition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981945</link><description>Besides the main flux-induced core loss, high flux density, and normal leakage flux in surface ribbons of nanocrystalline core can produce excess leakage flux core loss (LFCL) and leakage flux eddy current loss (LFECL), which are usually overlooked in core loss calculation. In this paper, total core loss of nanocrystalline core HFT under load condition is proposed to be calculated by summation of main flux induced core loss, LFCL and LFECL. The LFCL is proposed to be calculated by improved generalized Steinmetz equation based on practical flux density distribution and the LFECL is proposed to be calculated by Fourier superposition method based on LFECL resistances. Further, the impacts of surface ribbons saturation on LFCL and LFECL are analyzed. A three-dimensional finite element simulation method is proposed to calculate flux density and eddy current density distributions. A LFCL attenuation factor and a LFECL multiplication factor are proposed to correct LFCL and LFECL considering saturation. A HFT prototype is made and calorimetric method is applied to measure core loss. Without considering LFCL and LFECL, core loss calculation errors can exceed 60%. With the proposed method, leakage flux power loss calculation errors are within 15% and total core loss calculation errors are within 10%. The LFCL and LFECL are negligible in nanocrystalline core loss. The proposed method can guide nanocrystalline core HFT design.</description></item><item><title>Partial Discharge Behavior of High-Frequency Transformer Insulation Under High-Voltage PWM Stress</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10989053</link><description>As the voltage levels of solid-state transformers (SSTs) increase using medium-voltage switches, high-frequency transformers (HFTs) used inside SSTs are subjected to increased electrical stress. This stress, characterized by high voltage, high-frequency pulsewidth modulation (PWM) voltage, can cause insulation partial discharge (PD) and potentially lead to failure of the HFT insulation system. While PD behavior under power-frequency sinusoidal voltage has been extensively studied, the behavior of HFT insulation under PWM square pulse conditions is less well understood. To address this gap, a high voltage high-frequency PWM voltage PD test platform is developed and high-frequency current transformer (HFCT) and ultra-high-frequency (UHF) antenna are used for PD signal detection. PD tests are performed under a variety of PWM conditions including PWM frequency, rise time, voltage amplitude, and different insulation layers to thoroughly investigate the HFT insulation behavior. The PD characteristics of repetitive PD inception voltage and phase-resolved PD patterns at different PWM conditions are recorded and analyzed under PWM conditions. In addition, this article explores the underlying PD mechanisms of the HFT insulation under high-frequency PWM stress, providing insights to explain the observed test results. The findings from this research provide essential references and lay a solid foundation for future advances in optimal design, health monitoring, reliability analysis, and lifetime prediction for HFTs in power electronics applications.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Inductor-Transformers for High-Frequency Converters: An Overview</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002523</link><description>Integrated inductor-transformers, eliminating the need for external series inductors, provide disruptive improvements toward compact, efficient, and cost-effective converters in industries such as automotive and data center power supplies.

While previous studies have used thermal cycling tests ranging from &#8722;40 to 250 &#176;C, in situ observations of degradation in AMB-AlN have not been reported. In this work, internal cracking and 3-D deformation of AMB-AlN substrates were monitored by acoustic emission (AE) and digital image correlation (DIC) methods, respectively, throughout successive thermal cycles. The AMB-AlN substrates were significantly delaminated after eight thermal cycles. In the first five cycles, negligible deformation and delamination were observed by 3-D DIC and scanning acoustic microscopy. The cracks detected by AE produced low-amplitude signals only around &#8722;40 &#176;C. From the sixth to eighth cycles, the AE signal increased rapidly with the clear deformation of the substrate and depended on the temperature. A good correlation was found between the accumulated number of cracks detected by AE and the height of the Cu delamination from the substrate determined by DIC. In light of these findings, the delamination of the AMB-AlN substrate was attributed to the propagation of cracks in the substrate and their interconnected growth.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Enhanced Fault-Tolerant Full-Bridge Modular Multilevel Converters Using Reconfiguration During Open-Circuit Failures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982046</link><description>Modular multilevel converters (MMCs) are widely used in various applications due to their scalability, efficiency, and fault-tolerant capabilities. This article proposes a fault-tolerant methodology tailored for full-bridge (FB) submodules (SMs) in MMCs to enhance system reliability under open-circuit faults (OCFs) in insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs).

Accurate fault detection and localization are achieved through established methods, such as state observers and voltage comparisons. It is shown using MCS that the proposed method can improve the 17 kV 10 MVA converter reliability by almost 25% over solely redundancy-based solution for given lifetime requirements. Finally, using a lab-scale FB MMC prototype, it is experimentally shown that the proposed reconfiguration technique can successfully localize the fault and revert to normal operating requirements by shifting from FB to HB SM configuration in approximately 20 ms of fault initiation.</description></item><item><title>An Overview of Digital Twin Technology for Power Electronics: State-of-the-Art and Future Trends</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11005593</link><description>Power electronic systems (PESs) are pivotal in power generation, transmission, and diverse industrial applications.

However, under unbalanced grid conditions, the grid current becomes distorted, and the dc voltage exhibits a secondary ripple. To solve these problems, this article proposes a high gain proportional resonant (HGPR) ripple suppression method, the ripple suppression speed of the HGPR is faster than that of proportional resonant controllers, compared to quasi proportional resonant controllers, the HGPR controller offers higher gain and reduced steady-state error while maintaining a similar bandwidth and thus not affecting the stability of the system while maintaining the same parameter configuration. Compared with the existing dc voltage ripple suppression methods, the method proposed in this article has stronger ripple suppression capability, lower computational complexity, and excellent dynamic performance. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HGPR method can achieve low ripple dc voltage and low total harmonic distortion of current under grid voltage unbalance.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Decoupled Control of the Three-Level Interleaved DC&#8211;DC Converter With Coupled Inductors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10971249</link><description>For emerging high power dc&#8211;dc applications, such as those in power-to-x and energy storage systems, the three-level interleaved converter with coupled inductors offers several advantages, such as increased voltage and current ratings and a strong reduction of the output current ripple.

While larger dc-link electrolytic capacitors can help mitigate this issue by reducing neutral-point voltage oscillations, they also lead to a substantial increase in the volume of converters. This article presents consolidated carrier-based DPWM strategies capable of mitigating input current distortion by rectifying the vector synthesis error induced by oscillated NP voltages. Therefore, even with smaller dc-link capacitances, the improved input current performance can still be preserved. Moreover, the proposed methods employ only fundamental algebraic functions, helping conserve the limited hardware resources of the digital processor. Ultimately, an experimental prototype has been constructed to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed strategies.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Optimal Control of Dual-Bridge Series Resonant DC&#8211;AC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980455</link><description>Control plays a critical role in achieving efficient operation of dual-bridge series resonant dc&#8211;ac converters (DBSRC). However, realizing real-time, optimal, and robust control of DBSRC to maximize its efficiency is generally difficult, due to the complex interplay of control variables, efficiency, power demand, and voltage conversion ratio requirements. Here, we propose an optimal control strategy for DBSRC, suitable for real-time closed-loop controller implementation. The key to the strategy is the development of a closed-form analytical solution of the optimal control variables for maximum system efficiency and output power regulation. Detailed derivation of the optimal control solution is provided. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated on a 200-W DBSRC prototype.

The generated power is delivered to the grid by way of two paths: one via a passive rectifier and line-frequency inverter, and the other through an active rectifier and an inverter operating at switching frequencies higher than their respective fundamental frequencies, with the maximum power processed only 10% of the rated power. The remaining power is processed using the line-frequency path, employing reliable, efficient, and inexpensive diodes and switches. An analytical design framework shows that the high-frequency switch volt-ampere rating can be reduced by 67.9%.

Most of the TLIs in the literature either work on a buck or boost mode of operation. This article presents a new reduced-component five-level transformerless inverter (RC5LTLI) with a common ground configuration (CGC) for dual modes (buck and boost) of operation. Dual-mode operation enables the generation of output voltage across a wide range of input voltages while using a relatively small number of power components to achieve a five-level output. The CGC helps maintain a nearly constant common mode voltage and minimizes leakage current (LC). The level-shifted pulsewidth modulation generates the required gate pulses of RC5LTLI. A proportional resonant controller is used to perform the closed-loop operation of the inverter. The advantage of RC5LTLI can be found by conducting a comparative study with the similar existing art of literature. Further, losses and stress across the power components are analyzed using the PLECS simulation. The performance of RC5LTLI is verified experimentally for $1-\phi$ system for dual mode operation under unity power factor, lagging power factor, and the changes in input voltage. The practical feasibility of the RC5LTLI harmonic profile of the experimental prototype at 1 kW is studied on a power quality analyzer and matched to the European Energy Standard DIN VDE 126-1-1 that obeys the current and voltage limits and LC less than 300 mA. Last, the tested efficiency of the inverter system is 97.5% for the 1 kW load.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability Analysis of Multiparallel Grid-Forming Converters Considering Active and Reactive Power Control Coupling and Current Limiting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982104</link><description>During fault recovery stage, multiparallel grid-forming (MP-GFM) converters may retrigger the current limiter, leading to transient synchronization instability. While most existing studies focus on the transient synchronization stability (TSS) of single converters, and the well-established TSS studies designed for synchronous generators are not directly applicable to MP-GFM converters due to two key differences: active and reactive power control loop (ARPCL) coupling and current limiting. This article aims to address the TSS issue of MP-GFM converters during fault recovery stage, considering these two factors. First, a mathematical model of a system with MP-GFM converters is developed, considering ARPCL coupling and current limiting. Then, for the first time, the current limiting constrained largest estimated domain of attraction (CL-LEDA) is defined and constructed. Specifically, unlike traditional energy function (EF) that only considers active power control dynamics, an analytical EF that incorporates ARPCL coupling is proposed in this article. Furthermore, considering current limiting constraint, a new idea to calculate the critical energy value is proposed based on LaSalle's invariance principle. Then, the CL-LEDA can be constructed by the obtained EF and critical energy value. Provided that the operating state is located within this CL-LEDA at fault clearance moment, all MP-GFM converters will achieve transient stability, without triggering current limiting during faults recovery stage. Finally, experimental results based on RT-LAB hardware-in-the-loop and complete hardware-based experimental verify the analysis.</description></item><item><title>Modeling Method for DFIG-Based Wind Farm in High-Efficiency Real-Time Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) Simulations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988635</link><description>With the increasing integration of renewable energy into power systems, electromagnetic transient simulation has become indispensable for accurate system analysis. However, the complexity of wind turbine modeling, characterized by a large number of electrical nodes, poses significant challenges and necessitates substantial real-time simulation hardware. Existing methods for reducing circuit complexity improve simulation efficiency, but are each associated with inherent limitations. Aggregation methods sacrifice considerable internal station information, while existing decoupling techniques are constrained by specific requirements. This article proposes a real-time simulation model for a doubly fed induction generator-based wind farm (WF) using latency decoupling and a multilevel nested fast and simultaneous solution approach, effectively reducing node count while preserving internal details. A WF test model is implemented in real-time digital simulator (RTDS) for validation.

The MMDC is composed of numerous insulated gate bipolar transistor-based switches, which may impose an open-circuit fault (OCF). When an OCF occurs in the switch of the MMDC, the internal voltage and current may severely distort, potentially affecting the safe operation of the system. To address this issue, this article proposes a quasi-two-level modulation based OCF diagnosis and fault-tolerant operation method for an MMDC, which utilizes the signal synthesis of arm current and arm voltage modulation. First, the relationship between fault arm current and modulation wave is revealed. Based on this, a fault diagnosis algorithm is proposed to accurately identify the faulty arm and the fault type, without requiring additional sensors or complex calculations. The MMDC is then controlled in the proposed fault-tolerant mode by actively modifying the modulation wave until the specific faulty submodule is located and bypassed. This reduces voltage and current distortion. Subsequently, the modulation wave automatically returns to normal, allowing the system to quickly recover. Verification results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately and rapidly diagnoses the OCF and achieve fault-tolerant operation.</description></item><item><title>Model Predictive Power Control for High-Frequency Link Matrix Converter With Phase Compensation Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994363</link><description>High-frequency link matrix converter (HFLMC) is suitable for the battery testing instrument due to the characteristics of high efficiency and high reliability.

Active power control (APC) and phase-locked loop (PLL) are essential considerations while reactive power control (RPC) is often deemed negligible, particularly in stiff grid. However, such assumptions may be inappropriate. Therefore, this article aims to comprehensively examine the effects of APC and RPC on the inertia for doubly fed induction generator-based WTs. Firstly, phase motion models are developed by incorporating various combinations of control loops, including APC, RPC, and different PLL configurations. Subsequently, the impacts of the APC and RPC on the inertia are examined in detail. The analysis reveals that the APC diminishes inertia, whereas the RPC significantly enhances the inertia. Additionally, special attention should be given to phase characteristics of the inertia transfer function, as they can substantially influence inertial performance. Furthermore, an improved frequency support method is proposed, which achieves superior frequency response without necessitating the PLL bandwidth to be adjusted to extremely low values, such as 1 Hz or lower. Finally, the analysis and the proposed method are validated through experiments.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-High-Voltage Gain DC&#8211;DC Converter Based on Three-Winding Coupled Inductor With Ripple Free Input Current and Soft Switching for Renewable Energy Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994321</link><description>High-gain dc&#8211;dc converters are an important link for connecting low-voltage renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaics, to the high-voltage dc bus. This article presents a nonisolated ultra-high-voltage gain converter based on a three-winding coupled inductor for distributed renewable energy applications. The input inductor and clamping capacitor greatly reduce the input current ripple, so that tiny filter capacitors are required at the input port. Moreover, zero-voltage-switching and zero-current-switching of switches and diodes, respectively, are implemented, which effectively improves the efficiency of the proposed converter. In addition, the low-voltage stress of the semiconductor devices and the small number of components are also significant advantages of the proposed converter compared to existing topologies. The aforementioned features, as well as the common grounding of input and output, make the proposed topology a desirable solution for transformer less renewable energy systems. The operating principles, steady-state performance, design considerations, control method and dynamic modeling, and performance comparison of the proposed dc&#8211;dc converter have been demonstrated in this article. Finally, experimental results for a 500 W laboratory prototype with an input voltage of 30&#8211;40 V and a regulated output voltage of 400 V are shown to confirm the operation of the proposed converters.</description></item><item><title>Voltage Feedforward Damping Control Based on Duffing&#8211;Hopf Oscillator for Parallel Grid-Forming Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10995238</link><description>Oscillator-based grid-forming (GFM) control, such as dispatchable virtual oscillator and Andronov&#8211;Hopf oscillator control, offers a rigorous analytical framework with enhanced synchronization, lower harmonic, and faster dynamic response but lacks effective inertia support. Insufficient inertia will impair the stability and reliability of the power system, especially in the system with parallel inverters. To fundamentally solve the issue of insufficient inertia in traditional oscillator-based GFM control, a Duffing&#8211;Hopf oscillator control is proposed. The second-order Duffing&#8211;Hopf oscillator control ensures inertia and damping properties within the active power control loop. Furthermore, a q-axis component of the point of common coupling (PCC) voltage feedforward damping control is proposed to suppress active power oscillation during load fluctuations in the parallel system. The feedforward component provides extra damping power by indirectly incorporating the grid frequency into the active power control loop without relying on a phase-locked loop. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional oscillator-based GFM control, the Duffing&#8211;Hopf oscillator control provides enough inertia and damping ratio to alleviate the rate of change of frequency, and the q-axis component of PCC voltage feedforward control can effectively suppress the power oscillations caused by inconsistent control parameters.</description></item><item><title>Wide Voltage Range Efficiency Enhancement Scheme for Input-Parallel-Output-Series DAB Converters in 800 V DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10999069</link><description>Input-parallel-output-series dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter presents an appealing approach in energy storage integrated high-voltage dc microgrids. The wide voltage range of the energy storage battery introduces significant challenges to the optimal design of the DAB converter. To cope with this issue, this article proposes a hybrid modulation scheme to enhance the wide voltage range efficiency. It combines asymmetrical pulsewidth modulation (APWM), phase-shift modulation, and coupled inductor modulation, aimed at optimizing circulating currents and extending the zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) range across wide voltage and load ranges. APWM ensures that the primary and secondary voltages are aligned through the intermediary dc blocking capacitor. Meanwhile, the coupled inductor modulation achieves an adaptive equivalent series inductance. The operational modes of this modulation scheme are outlined, with a thorough analysis of the relationship between root-mean-square (rms) current, phase shift ratio, voltage gain, and output power. Based on these insights, a control strategy is developed to extend the ZVS range with reduced rms currents. To validate the concept, a 2-kW, 100-kHz prototype is designed and tested. The prototype interfaces a 200&#8211;400 V battery port to an 800 V dc bus. Recorded efficiencies peak at 98.3% in forward mode and 98.2% in backward mode, with consistently high performance maintained across wide voltage and load ranges.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Constraints Model Active Mismatch Predictive Control for Power Converters of Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11006519</link><description>Model predictive control (MPC) is widely employed for power converters in energy storage systems.

However, standard model predictive control suffers from a high dependency on model parameters. To solve this issue, a novel finite set subspace predictor-based predictive voltage control strategy is proposed in this article, aiming to improve the robustness of the controlled system while maintaining the attractive features of standard FCS-MPC. Specifically, by replacing the original physical model with a subspace predictor at each operating point, the optimal control input can be directly obtained according to the reference output trajectory, and the control action can be executed without knowing the system structure and load parameters. This method uses only historical input&#8211;output data in the prediction process, thereby avoiding performance degradation caused by variations in load parameters. Finally, experiments on a three-level neutral-point clamped inverter validate the proposed design.</description></item><item><title>Long-Horizon MPC Reference Generator for Circulating Currents in Modular Multilevel Converter-Based Variable-Speed Drives</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869501</link><description>The article introduces a circulating current reference generator based on a constrained model predictive control (MPC) in modular multilevel converters (M2C) for drive applications.

The optimal control problem is decomposed into smaller subproblems, which allows the utilization of an iterative algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to efficiently solve the optimization problem. As a result, the ADMM-based reference generator enables a considerably extended prediction horizon, which enhances M2C performance, particularly in balancing and mitigating low-frequency oscillations in capacitor voltages during challenging operating conditions like low-speed and high-torque scenarios. The proposed control is validated by experimental results using an M2C with four cells per cluster driving a 3 kW induction machine.</description></item><item><title>Terrace-Shaped Core Design Method for Inductive Power Transfer System Considering Uniform Magnetic Flux Distribution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10852559</link><description>Inductive power transfer (IPT) has attracted a lot of attention, and it has a tendency toward high-power applications. However, the problem of nonuniform magnetic flux distribution exists and is unsolved in IPT systems, which will cause unbalanced core loss and local heat, lowering the system&#8217;s stability. Therefore, a novel terrace-shaped core made of nanocrystalline flake ribbon (NFR) is proposed and investigated to balance the magnetic flux in the core for curved double-D couplers. Unlike merely increasing the core thickness in the center area, the terrace-shaped NFR (T-NFR) can realize uniform magnetic flux distribution and balanced temperature along the core.

However, for the PSFB WPT system, switching loss is a key factor affecting the system efficiency. Single-side PSFB can regulate the power, but hard switching results in low efficiency and EMI problems. Dual-side PSFB can realize ZVS throughout a wide power range, but at the cost of high conduction loss and turn-off loss at light load. In this article, a WPT converter combining tandem half bridge (THB) and active rectifier (AR) is proposed to reduce the switching loss of the system at light and medium loads.

Model-based control is widely used in converters due to its ease, but it poses challenges when dealing with inaccurate models, critical loads, and multidisturbances.

Their flexibility comes from the possibility to store hydrogen, decoupling electric consumption from hydrogen demand. Therefore, they can help in the integration of more renewable energies by the provision of grid services, such as frequency regulation. Alkaline electrolyzers (AELs) are the most mature and cost effective technology for large-scale hydrogen applications. However, their slow dynamics do not allow a fast response. Therefore, their combination with energy storage systems (ESSs) into hybrid hydrogen systems (HHSs) enhances their flexibility and fast response for frequency regulation. Supercapacitors (SCs) are suitable ESS technology in this application due to the high power and low energy required. A decentralized dynamic power sharing control is proposed for an AEL/SC HHS to provide frequency regulation with scalability. The control strategy respects the slow dynamics of the AEL, while the use of the SC is optimized by the automatic recovery of the dc bus voltage and SC state of charge (SoC). The decentralized approach of the control strategy enables easy expansion of the system, essential for large-scale hydrogen systems. The effectiveness of the method in large-scale power systems, as well as its scalability is shown in simulation results. The control strategy is validated with experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Analysis of Photovoltaic to Virtual Bus Parallel Differential Power Processing Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856681</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) to virtual bus parallel differential power processing (PDPP) architecture can mitigate mismatch losses among PV strings.

However, while operating as a voltage source that is synchronized via active power regulation, the GFM converter exhibits insufficient damping, particularly when synthetic inertia is incorporated for frequency support. To address this concern, this article has developed active-damping control schemes using fractional-order regulators. Differing from the existing control approaches, which may significantly alter the inertial response quantified using an inertia constant, the proposed controls are developed to introduce adequate damping for both power set-point tracking and external disturbances, while maintaining the original explicit relationship between the GFM converter's inertial response and the inertia constant. In this context, a preferable inertial response, precisely defined by the inertia constant as specified by certain grid codes, along with adequate damping, is achieved simultaneously. The effectiveness of the proposed controls has been validated though both theoretical analyses and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Design-Oriented Small-Signal Stability Assessment of Grid-Following Inverter-Based Resources Based on Virtual Dynamic Short-Circuit Ratio</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856703</link><description>Small-signal instability may occur when parallel grid-following inverter-based resources (IBRs) are connected to a grid with low strength, i.e., a weak grid. In such a weak grid, changes in output power and the number of IBRs can significantly impact the small-signal stability margin. However, the short-circuit ratios (SCRs) currently used for small-signal stability assessment of the IBR plant are static indices, and the difference in the IBR plant impedance with different total output power is not considered, resulting in inaccurate stability assessment results. Moreover, the stability margin expressed by the existing SCRs under different operating conditions is not unified. Therefore, the virtual dynamic short-circuit ratio (VDSCR) is proposed in this article, which converts the stability margin of the IBR plant under different working conditions to the rated single IBR unit, so that the proposed VDSCR is accurate and unified. Based on the VDSCR, the IBRs control is designed under the fluctuation of total output power and grid impedance, which can keep the small-signal stability margin at the set value. While ensuring the small-signal stability of the IBR plant, the control performance of the IBRs is further optimized through the control design based on VDSCR. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Optimal FNN-Based Energy Management System With High Real-Time Performance and Good Interpretability for Battery in Grid-Connected Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858356</link><description>In this article, a novel energy management system (EMS) is presented for a grid-connected microgrid using the fuzzy neural network (FNN), aiming to minimize the mismatch between renewable power generation and load power demand in the microgrid by controlling the battery charge/discharge power in real time, so as to effectively promote the local consumption of renewable energy.

To overcome these issues, this article proposes a partial-power converter for BESS. It stacks voltage-tuning bridge and reversal-blocking chopper on battery pack with their dc-links crossly connected through a three-port dc&#8211;dc circuit. The dc&#8211;dc circuit provides isolated low-impedance channels for automatically clamping dc-link voltages. This ensures the linear voltage regulation in normal state and immediate short-circuit-current blocking under fault condition. As compared to the prior arts, the proposal achieves: 1) linear voltage regulations in wide range through step-up and step-down operations guided by pulse width modulation without any dead zones; 2) immediate dc fault blocking by deenergizing short circuit loop rather than by interrupting the current, thereby avoiding spike and stickiness issues; and 3) around 0.5% enhancement in power efficiency due to the fully resonant dc&#8211;dc unit with low switching losses, and the substitution of the two anti-series switch in dc breaker by the one in reversal-blocking unit. The entire system achieves the maximal power efficiency of 98.93%. The feasibility of the proposal is fully confirmed by the experiments rated at 350-V 3.5-kW.</description></item><item><title>A Multifunctional Arc Suppression Device Based on Hybrid Grid-Connected Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856704</link><description>Since the voltage amplitude of the arc suppression device is different during the normal operation and single line-to-ground fault, the problems of high cost and low module utilization rate are serious. An integrated grid-connected converter (IGCC) with reactive power compensation and fault regulation ability is proposed. First, the topology and operation mechanism of IGCC are introduced in this article. A common unit combining neutral point clamped (NPC) and cascaded H-bridge is formed by improving the traditional arc suppression device. By adding a fourth leg in the NPC module and connecting with the arc suppression inductance, the integration of the two structures is realized. The access of NPC unit not only reduces the number of modules of traditional arc suppression device, but also provides an integrated port for arc suppression device and reactive power compensation device. Second, the parameters of active and passive part of IGCC are optimally designed to ensure the stable operation of IGCC. In addition, compared with existing schemes, the superiority of IGCC in cost and volume is proved. Finally, the correctness, feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed topology and functions are verified by the simulation and experiment results.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Modeling of Battery-Based Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869498</link><description>This article presents a data-driven modeling methodology applied to a battery-based power system comprising a power converter and an electric machine.

In particular, the proposed approach considers the battery as the supplying element of a broader system comprising power electronics converters and direct-current motors, paying special attention to the battery open-circuit voltage curve estimation. This approach successfully yields a state-space representation that optimally describes the more essential variables, such as motor speed and output voltages of the converter and battery. Consequently, the proposed approach allows the generation of higher-order models representing transient and rapid dynamics and facilitates the identification of parameters that define reduced-order models describing slower dynamics. This streamlines the implementation of adaptive control strategies, providing an effective tool for their development and execution.</description></item><item><title>Attention-Based UAV Trajectory Optimization for Wireless Power Transfer-Assisted IoT Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879146</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in wireless power transfer (WPT)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) systems face the following challenges: limited resources and suboptimal trajectory planning. Reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning schemes face issues of low search efficiency and learning instability when optimizing large-scale systems. To address these issues, we present an attention-based UAV trajectory optimization (AUTO) framework based on the graph transformer, which consists of an attention trajectory optimization model (ATOM) and a trajectory lEarNing method based on actor&#8211;critic (TENMA). In ATOM, a graph encoder is used to calculate the self-attention characteristics of all IoTDs, and a trajectory decoder is developed to optimize the number and trajectories of UAVs. TENMA then trains the ATOM using an improved actor&#8211;critic method, in which the real reward of the system is applied as the baseline to reduce variances in the critic network. This method is suitable for high-quality and large-scale multi-UAV trajectory planning. Finally, we develop numerous experiments, including a hardware experiment in the field case, to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the AUTO framework.</description></item><item><title>Assessment of the DSC Technique for Positive-Sequence Extraction in Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858480</link><description>In the context of electrical power systems, where nonlinear loads, power converters, and exogenous disturbances can significantly distort electrical signals, there remains a critical need to accurately extract signal parameters useful for various essential tasks, including monitoring, synchronization, and protection. Traditionally, a positive-sequence filter, often based on the well-established Park filter, has been used to mitigate these disturbances. However, the delayed signal cancellation technique (DSC) has gained prominence as a viable alternative, offering similar advantages to the Park filter, but without the need for phase feedback. This growing interest in DSC has led to numerous studies that aim to refine its original concept. However, these efforts have not comprehensively evaluated the DSC alongside the Park filter to discern and quantify its benefits and drawbacks. Inspired by the fact that the DSC exhibits spectral replica, characterized by high-gain repeating side lobes in its frequency response, this article aims to conduct a thorough comparative analysis between the DSC technique and the conventional Park filter. The primary objective is to quantitatively evaluate both approaches in positive-sequence extraction tasks, thereby shedding light on their practical advantages in scenarios marked by signal distortion and perturbations.</description></item><item><title>A Fault-Tolerant Control for Hybrid Active Neutral-Point-Clamped Converters With Shared Redundant Unit Under Multiswitch Open-Circuit Fault</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10870874</link><description>Hybrid active neutral-point-clamped (HANPC) converters comprising silicon and silicon carbide devices are promising topologies in middle-low power conversion systems. The reliable operation of such converters is highly desirable, which depends on effective fault-tolerant schemes. However, existing schemes do not provide HANPC converters with the ability to tolerate the failures of multiple outer-switches with satisfactory fault-tolerant performance in terms of neutral-point voltage balancing and rated output voltage. To address this issue, the shared redundant unit is configured into HANPC converters. The matched fault-tolerant control strategy is proposed with rearranged switching sequences by utilizing the available space vector. In this context, the feasible region of the designed vector sequence (FRDVS) for fault-tolerant operation of HANPC converters is defined. Subsequently, the boundaries of FRDVS are quantitatively analyzed under different power factors. The improved fault-tolerant scheme allows the continuous operation of HANPC converters at rated capacity during the fault period, even up to open-circuit faults at all outer-switches. Experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant scheme.</description></item><item><title>Multiobjective Optimization Control for Nonideal Single-Inductor Dual-Output Buck Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858475</link><description>Single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) buck converter has been widely applied in fields of portable electronic products and smart homes due to their advantages of small size and multiple outputs. However, cross regulation seriously deteriorates the stability of the converter. In addition, parasitic parameters of circuit components reduce the conversion efficiency of the converter and have a significant impact on cross regulation. To suppress the cross regulation and improve the conversion efficiency of the nonideal SIDO buck converter, a multiobjective optimization control strategy is proposed. Considering the parasitic parameters of circuit components, a large signal model of the converter is established, and a predictive equation is constructed based on the model predictive control theory. Furthermore, an objective function for optimizing output error is established based on weighting the output voltage error and inductor current error. Then, a method is proposed to achieve real-time correction of the state variable reference values. The power loss of the system is analyzed and weighted onto the objective function to improve the conversion efficiency. Compared with the common mode voltage-differential mode voltage control method, simulation and experimental results show that the proposed strategy provides smaller cross regulation and better dynamic performance. The conversion efficiency is improved by 6.6%.</description></item><item><title>A Quasi-Noncascaded DC-Link Voltage Predictive Control of a PWM Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10875037</link><description>The main function of pulse-width modulation (PWM) converters in many applications is to control the dc-link voltage with good dynamic performance and strong disturbance rejection capability. Finite-control-set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) is known for its merits in both the above aspects, especially the noncascaded FCS-MPC control structure. However, as to be discussed in this article, the noncascaded FCS-MPC cannot be used to directly control the dc-link voltage of PWM converters, due to the problem of multiequilibrium points caused by the essential nonlinear characteristic of PWM converters. Hence, a quasi-noncascaded dc-link voltage predictive control structure is proposed for the first time, which keeps the outstanding dynamic performance and strong disturbance rejection capability of noncascaded FCS-MPC while avoids overcurrent caused by the unexpected equilibrium points. In addition, the proposed method can inherently handle the parameter mismatch issue, which is an important merit for MPC. Experimental results validate the theoretical analysis and performance of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Robust Open Circuit Fault Detection and Localization Scheme for HERIC PV Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10855000</link><description>Transformerless inverters are widely used to integrate the photovoltaic (PV) source into the distributed generation system. Within the converter, an open-circuit (OC) switch fault may lead to the partial or total failure of the converter. To address this issue, a new technique for detecting and localizing OC switch faults based on pole-to-pole voltage (voltage measured across the inverter output terminals) is proposed. The proposed variables for fault detection and localization (FDL) are continuously generated with every sampled pole-to-pole voltage and are compared with threshold values which are immune to parameter variation. As a result, OC is detected and located within a switching cycle for the ac side bypass switches. For localizing the OC fault in the H-bridge, the converter is reconfigured once the fault in the H-bridge switch is detected using pole-to-pole voltage. The input voltage required for the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is estimated from the voltage measured with the new sensor arrangement for pole-to-pole voltage measurement. This makes the number of sensors the same as in a conventional converter. The viability and effectiveness of this approach are demonstrated through simulation studies on the highly efficient and reliable inverter concept (HERIC) inverter, a popular transformerless inverter topology. Additionally, a laboratory prototype is developed to validate the practical applicability of the method.</description></item><item><title>Extended Kalman Filtering for Floating Capacitor Voltage Estimation on Triple Star Bridge Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10871191</link><description>Modular multilevel cascade converters (MMCCs) have emerged as one of the most attractive topologies for medium and high-voltage applications due to their modularity, scalability, redundancy, and high power quality. Voltage balancing in power submodule (SM) capacitors plays a critical role in the internal energy balancing of the MMCC, making monitoring SM capacitor voltages a crucial task. However, achieving higher operating voltages requires a substantial increase in the number of voltage sensors and communication lines. This escalation in hardware complexity renders the system more reliant on sensors, reducing its reliability. Several techniques for estimating capacitor voltages have been presented to address this control and design burden. This work proposes an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based observer for capacitor voltage estimation of all SMs in a triple-star bridge converter (TSBC). The proposed approach operates effectively under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions during transients and steady-state operation, enabling a decoupled controller using just one voltage and one current sensor per cluster. Experiments conducted in a TSBC composed of 27 SMs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach during transients and steady-state operation.</description></item><item><title>Dual Storage Power Management for Energy Autonomous Microsystems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854998</link><description>A major challenge towards enabling energy autonomous microsystems is cold-starting, especially in real use case environments which are often uncertain and involve long inactivity periods. In this article, a dual supercapacitor storage power management architecture is proposed, with the primary storage capacitor providing fast start-up and the secondary providing a large energy buffer. The circuit introduces a combination of a MOSFET switch and a buck converter that can handle efficient charge transport and eliminate leakage between the two storage capacitors, leading to faster cold starting. A start-up time reduction of more than two orders of magnitude over conventional solutions is experimentally demonstrated, for a 1.5 mF/470 mF supercapacitor combination, without a compromise in overall efficiency. The various functional modes of the system are experimentally analyzed, using an inductive power line energy harvester with currents that correspond to an industrially defined aircraft sensor use case. For example, 11 mW and 32 mW regulated output was measured from a 10 A and 15 A rms, 500 Hz power line, respectively. The architecture is configurable and can be dynamically parametrized and controlled to optimize power routing according to functional priorities by the microcontroller of the powered system.</description></item><item><title>A Noninvasive Resonant Galvanometer With Multiple Measurement Ranges</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869509</link><description>Noninvasive, real-time monitoring of large-span currents in power grid and electric vehicles remains a challenge. A resonant galvanometer (RGM) achieving multiple measurement ranges with a single sensing unit is proposed in this article. An electromagnetic torque introduced theory for ac measurement is established to analyze the deviated output voltages, which have not been well physically interpreted and theoretically characterized so far. The deviated output voltages are defined as two asymmetric subpeaks for the first time. According to the Euler&#8211;Bernoulli beam theory, two asymmetric subpeaks have the potential to achieve multirange measurement with the main peak, which is at the magnetic field gradient extremum and directly opposite to the cable. A multirange sensing mechanism is proposed with three peaks, comprised of two newly defined asymmetric subpeaks and one main peak. Measurement ranges of the two subpeaks are two and five times than that of the main peak, respectively. Geometrical design of the sensing unit is analyzed to further adjust the multiranges via three peak values. A prototype with a single sensing unit is designed and fabricated to achieve multiple measurement ranges, and its practical applications in power grid and electric vehicles are also considered.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Method for Identifying the Reverse Recovery State of Thyristors Based on Gate Voltage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10875032</link><description>As a critical power electronic device in dc transmission systems, thyristors are highly favored for their low conduction loss, excellent surge capability, economic efficiency, and reliable current-carrying performance. However, in key applications such as commutation converters, active inverters, and circuit breakers, accurately determining the off-state of thyristors remains a significant challenge for the reliable operation of these systems. The traditional method relies on detecting the reverse recovery current flowing through the thyristor to determine its off-state. This method is often plagued by detection difficulties, high costs, and insufficient accuracy, and no new methods for detecting the off-state of thyristors have been proposed for decades. To address the difficulty in recognizing the off-state of thyristors, this article proposes a novel method for identifying the reverse recovery state of thyristors based on the gate voltage of the thyristor. This method eliminates the need to measure the high current on the primary side, requiring only the measurement of a small voltage on the secondary side to accurately determine the thyristor's reverse recovery state. Experimental validation confirms the feasibility of this approach. The proposed method offers advantages such as low cost and ease of integration, providing an effective solution for identifying the reverse recovery state of thyristors in existing equipment.</description></item><item><title>Ripple Free Modulation Method for Parallel Hybrid DC&#8211;DC Converter to Mitigate DC Link Filter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856685</link><description>The development of dc grids requires compact, economical, and efficient means of dc&#8211;dc integration. The parallel hybrid converter (PHC) is a suitable candidate for dc&#8211;dc integration due to its low energy storage requirement (ESR), soft switching, low submodule (SM) and switch count. However, the requirement of large dc side filtering and harmonic voltage injection (HVI) have been crucial limitations of the PHC.

Small-signal stability is a representative issue. Though, existing frameworks either ignore the uncertainties of renewables, or only focus on the worst case. In this regard, this paper establishes a small-signal stability constrained stochastic-robust optimal power flow (OPF) model, which aims to optimize the expected cost of scheduling results with respect to the probability distributions of uncertainties while ensuring the small-signal stability requirement even in extreme scenarios. However, the synergy of uncertainties and the complicated small-signal stability mechanism significantly increase the solving difficulty. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework to overcome this challenge. First, we solve the stochastic OPF without small-signal stability constraints. For those results that do not meet the stability requirements, we use them as initial points to locate the effective boundary of the OPF feasible region where the robust small-signal stability requirement is satisfied. The effective boundary location is realized in an iterative manner. Then, in the neighborhood of this effective boundary, we construct a linear surrogate expression to represent the original robust small-signal stability constraint with Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and sample weighted support vector machine (swSVM). Finally, we solve the OPF model with the surrogate constraint. Moreover, we further propose a constraint correction strategy to guarantee the stability requirement. Case studies verify that the proposed method can acquire economical operation schemes and meet the robust small-signal stability requirement at the same time.</description></item><item><title>A Self-Supervised Pre-Learning Method for Low Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839636</link><description>As wind power is becoming a major energy source of power systems, the risk of power shortages due to its intermittent low power output is growing. Accurate forecasting of low wind power is crucial for mitigating these impacts. However, conventional methods struggle with few-sample issues due to the infrequent occurrence of low wind power, limiting accuracy improvements. To address this, a self-supervised pre-learning method is proposed to forecast low wind power occurrence period and output, leveraging the similarities and differences among low output samples to enhance forecasting accuracy. Low wind power output is decomposed into low wind power events (LWPE), which represent the occurrence timeframe, and low wind power processes (LWPP), which represent the power sequences. For LWPE forecasting, a siamese residual shrinkage network based on contrastive learning is introduced. This network pre-learns LWPE features from sample pairs to mitigate the impact of imbalanced sample distribution. For LWPP forecasting, a pattern recognition-based embedded forecasting framework is proposed, embedding typical LWPP fluctuations into the prediction network to improve fit under limited sample conditions. A case study on 3 wind farm clusters shows that this method improves LWPP forecasting accuracy from 84.99%-86.6% to 89.97%, outperforming traditional methods without pre-learning.</description></item><item><title>Estimation of Stability Region for Grid-Forming Inverters Considering Switching Characteristics via Constructing Damping-Reflected Energy Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843855</link><description>Grid-forming (GFM) inverters have been widely used as the interface between renewable energy sources and power grid. During low voltage ride through (LVRT) period, to limit the fault current, GFM inverters will experience the switching of control strategy, which makes the transient stability of GFM inverters exhibit different features from that of synchronous generators (SGs). In this paper, considering the switching characteristics induced by virtual impedance (VI), the framework of predicting the transient stability of GFM inverters during the fault period and after fault clearance is established from the perspective of energy. To reduce the conservativeness of the stability region, a uniform energy function considering the damping dissipation and the dynamics of reactive power control loop is constructed for the transient stability analysis of GFM inverters. Compared with existing approaches, the stability region estimated by the proposed energy function can intuitively show the effect of damping, and effectively reduce the degree of conservatism in transient stability prediction. Finally, simulation and hardware-in-loop experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method in the transient stability prediction of GFM inverters with switching characteristics.</description></item><item><title>A Decentralized Demanded Power Tracking and Voltage Control Method for Wind Farms Based on Data-Driven Sensitivities</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10848501</link><description>Efficient power dispatch in wind farms (WFs) hinges on precise demanded power tracking. This study proposes a decentralized WF power tracking and voltage control method based on data-driven sensitivities (DDSs). This method relies only on local operational variables for model predictive control (MPC), achieving near-global optimal solutions. With a backpropagation algorithm, a new sensitivity calculation method is designed to yield DDSs by computing the gradients of a global mapping model (GMM). The voltage DDSs can be derived simply by calculating the gradient of the voltage GMM and can replace the voltage sensitivities in traditional MPC methods. The power DDSs establishes linear relationships between the power outputs of different wind turbines (WTs), simplifying the WF state-space equations to local prediction models for reducing the quadratic programming dimensions. The three control modes designed based on DDSs enable control without WF line parameters, reduce computational complexity, or combine both effects. The variable spacing constraint linearization method transforms nonlinear constraints into linear ones, addressing the nonlinear coupling between control variables. Testing on a WF with 32 WTs in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method comparable to centralized control methods.</description></item><item><title>Approximately Adaptive Distributionally Robust Optimization for Energy and Reserve Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10849978</link><description>This paper proposes two novel paradigms of approximately adaptive distributionally robust optimization (AADRO) for the energy and reserve dispatch with wind uncertainty. The piecewise linear policy-based AADRO (PLP-AADRO) approximates the adaptive optimization-based recourse decision as piecewise affine adjustment, while the piecewise value function-based AADRO (PVF-AADRO) approximates the quadratic recourse problem as piecewise linear recourse problems. Moreover, an equal probability principle is developed to achieve a high-quality segmentation of the wind power ambiguity set. Consequently, the distributionally robust quadratic cost constraint can be decomposed into decoupled piecewise constraints, allowing the dispatch problem to be formulated as a less-iterative or even non-iterative program. The two-stage AADROs with polyhedron supported uncertainties are first recast precisely as tractable forms with semidefinite constraints, by employing duality theory and S-lemma. Then, the distributionally robust cost constraint in PVF-AADRO is handled by dual vertex generation, and the bilinear terms in both AADROs are addressed by alternating optimization. Numerical simulations verify the efficiency of AADROs in approximating the strict adaptive distributionally robust optimization, and their adaptability in different cases is discussed.</description></item><item><title>Inertia Transmission Control of Full-Power Converter Variable-Speed Pumped Storage System for Grid Frequency Support</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10852016</link><description>Full-power converter variable-speed pumped storage (FPC-VSPS) is a promising technique for flexible power regulation in small-scale distributed hydroelectric power plants. However, conventional vector control limits the synchronous motor of the FPC-VSPS from providing inertia support to the power grid. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces an inertia transmission control for FPC-VSPS based on the concept of DC voltage synchronization. Firstly, the control incorporates the DC capacitor power equation into the GSC control. To enable inertia transmission from the FPC-VSPS synchronous machine, the DC capacitor dynamics are fed into both the speed and torque control of the MSC. Secondly, a torsion spring-rigid body equivalent model is introduced based on the inertia transmission process, analyzing the effects of physical parameters, control coefficients, and transmission delays on the inertia transmission performance. Theoretical analysis and simulation results reveal that the inherent physical differences and transmission delay have a negative impact on the effectiveness of the inertia transmission. Consequently, a DC capacitor design method based on inertia matching is proposed, accounting for the constraints of physical inertia matching, system stability, and operational security. Finally, simulations and experiments prove the necessity of inertia matching and verify the effectiveness of the proposed control to cope with frequency fluctuations in both pumping and generating modes.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Grid-Forming Undersea Pumped Storage to Enable 100% Renewable Offshore Oilfield Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854915</link><description>To advance carbon reduction of the offshore oilfield power system (OOPS), the grid-forming undersea pumped storage system (GFM-UPSS) emerges as a promising solution. This paper introduces a novel framework for a 100% renewable OOPS utilizing the GFM-UPSS. Firstly, the control strategy of the GFM-UPSS is presented. It consists of the grid-side converter (GSC), machine-side converter (MSC), and reversible pump-turbine (RPT) to achieve frequency and voltage regulation. A steady-state model is then developed detailing the water head, power, and volume of the spherical shell. In addition, the paper explores the converter parameter impacts on the GFM-UPSS transient model and derives the closed-form solutions. With the steady-state model, an optimal sizing method is presented and economic advantages in the marine environment are studied for the GFM-UPSS. Finally, EMT simulations are conducted to assess the frequency &amp; voltage stabilities and verify the effectiveness of the GFM-UPSS in enabling a 100% renewable OOPS. The optimal sizing results show that construction costs, mainly for OWP, are dominated and are influenced by sphere radius, placement depth, and start-stop cycles, while a 2.5 capacity ratio between OWP and GFM-UPSS consistently emerges as optimal. Moreover, analysis of transient stability shows that it improves with higher frequency &amp; voltage modulation coefficient and lower virtual impedance. The impact of RPT and MSC, mainly on frequency regulation, is determined by the DC droop coefficient and turbine inertia.</description></item><item><title>A Coordinated Adaptive SMC Method for Frequency Regulation Control in Power Systems With Multiple Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10855531</link><description>The extensive integration of renewable energy resources inevitably gives rise to the complex and uncertain power system, where the somber matter of frequency instability becomes apparent. This article presents a coordinated adaptive radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)-based sliding mode control (CAR-SMC) to reduce the frequency deviation and oscillation of the uncertain power system comprising multiple wind farms. Firstly, the SMC is aimed at establishing the upper layer control law of the frequency regulation controllers. Then, the uncertainties are represented with RBFNN, and an adaptive law is employed to estimate the uncertainties online rapidly and realize the free-chattering of SMC. Furthermore, since a single SMC is only capable of handling a single control input system, a power distribution law based on momentum is proposed to implement the multiple control inputs of the AR-SMC, and also coordinate the frequency regulation abilities of wind turbines and energy storage systems (ESSs). Eventually, the proposed CAR-SMC is validated on a modified IEEE 39-bus system. The simulation results demonstrate that CAR-SMC can enhance the frequency stability in the presence of disturbances and uncertainties during steady-state operation, as well as in under-frequency and over-frequency scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Spatio-Temporal Wind Speed Prediction Based on OWT-STGradRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869841</link><description>Taking into account the orientation and distance characteristics of wind turbine stations in wind farms can improve the accuracy of wind power prediction.

However, current methods are affected by the intermittent, non-stationary and stochastic nature of solar energy and thus cannot satisfy the requirement of high-precision forecasting. To this end, we propose a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) forecasting method based on bubble entropy and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) regularization, called BesFCM. This method first utilizes bubble entropy to fuse two mode decomposition methods to improve the representation of PV data to capture effective features with significant stability and discriminative ability, then employs a FCM with a combination of fuzzy logic, neural networks, and expert systems to model solar PV power generation, and finally develops a high order FCM learning method based on SCAD regularization to alleviate the overfitting problem, enhancing the robustness and generalization ability of forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate that the BesFCM achieves the best overall performance on PV power datasets from multiple sampling intervals in multiple regions of Belgium compared to multiple state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness for solar power generation forecasting, providing support and reference for improving the quality of smart grid dispatch and reducing spare capacity reserves.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Suppression for Temporary Overvoltage Considering Dynamic Interactions Between LCC-HVDC and Renewable Energy Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874178</link><description>Temporary overvoltage (TOV) severely restricts the development and utilization of renewable power resources (RPRs), especially when RPRs are delivered through the line commutated converter-based high voltage direct current (LCC-HVDC) system. To reveal the TOV mechanism for the sending system during commutation failures (CFs), the transient process of the system is partitioned into different stages, where the evolution of the system trajectories is analyzed. On this basis, the variation of AC voltage and DC current considering complex dynamic interactions between LCC-HVDC and renewable energy Plants (REPs) during repetitive CFs (RCFs) is clearly quantified. After revealing the impact of control parameters of both REPs and the LCC-HVDC on the TOV during RCFs, a collaborative optimization method for control parameters is proposed for TOV suppression. Moreover, when the blocking after the RCF tends to be inevitable, the optimal blocking moment is determined to inhibit the TOV caused by HVDC blocking. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods are verified with EMT simulations of a typical benchmark system.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Modeling and Switching Control of Electric Vehicle Aggregation for Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10878811</link><description>The aggregation and control of massive electric vehicles (EVs) are crucial for grid frequency regulation (FR). However, challenges such as disordered charging, high computational and communication burdens need to be addressed. To this end, a hierarchical hybrid modeling and switching control method for EV aggregation (EVA) is proposed. For modeling, a hybrid state set for EVs comprising three discrete states and one dynamic state is established at the local level. The dynamic state's flexibility allows EVs to charge orderly while considering user demands. At the aggregation level, a Markov-based EVA state space model is designed, integrating the user's willingness-to-pay (WTP) index and hybrid state. It estimates the EVA's FR capacity (FRC) with a lower communication burden and reduces computational burden by simplifying control dimensions. For control, a model predictive control (MPC)-based state switching method is designed at the aggregation level, considering user's FR willingness and power cancellation issue. Furthermore, a predictive compensation mechanism is designed to address model parameter errors resulting from asynchronous control cycles. At the local level, a probabilistic response method is proposed for responding to dispatched control signals, which reduces battery degradation through the state of charge (SOC) based response probability generation. Simulation results validate the method's effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Coordinated Control Strategy for Enhanced Performance of Energy Storage System in Secondary Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879267</link><description>This paper presents a hierarchical coordinated con-trol strategy designed to enhance the overall performance of the energy storage system (ESS) in secondary frequency regulation (SFR). The strategy includes three layers: the system layer, the ESS operation layer, and the coordination control layer. In the system layer, a detailed frequency response model of the multi-area interconnected system is developed. The intrinsic mech-anisms of timing, depth, and the effect of ESS and conventional generating unit (CGU) in SFR are revealed through the sen-sitivity analysis of the power allocation factor. Furthermore, a sensitivity-based adaptive power allocation strategy for ESS and CGU is proposed, which improves the SFR effect while reducing the ESS power and maintaining the state of charge (SOC). In the ESS operation layer, the ESS is divided into two components for integration, employing a monotonic charge-discharge strategy to reduce lifetime degradation caused by frequent charging and discharging, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. In the coordination control layer, considering the power prediction and the ESS operating state, a SOC optimization strategy based on the double-input fuzzy control (DIFC) is proposed. It further dynamically corrects the power allocation factor based on fuzzy rules, optimizing the SOC level to ensure the bidirectional SFR capability of ESS under all conditions. The case studies validate the overall SFR performance of the proposed strategy with different scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Spatiotemporal Graph Contrastive Learning for Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879260</link><description>Accurate and robust wind power forecasting plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and stability of the power system. Hybrid spatiotemporal forecasting models based on graph convolutional networks have received widespread attention due to their advantages in spatial feature extraction. However, these methods are susceptible to the quality of the generated graph due to data noise and missing issues, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning model based on spatiotemporal graph contrastive learning to address the above issues. Specifically, the model's encoder combines an adaptive graph convolutional network with LSTM to capture fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies. To enhance the robustness of the encoder against data noise, we apply feature-level and topology-level data augmentation techniques to the model's input and design two contrastive learning auxiliary tasks from the temporal and spatial dimensions, respectively. Furthermore, to capture more comprehensive spatial correlations, we construct an adaptive graph by fusing the static graph with a learnable parameter matrix. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>A Carryover Storage Valuation Framework for Medium-Term Cascaded Hydropower Planning: A Portland General Electric System Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884034</link><description>Medium-term planning of cascaded hydropower (CHP) determines appropriate carryover storage levels in reservoirs to optimize the usage of available water resources. This optimization seeks to maximize the hydropower generated in the current period (i.e., immediate benefit) plus the potential hydropower generation in the future period (i.e., future value). Thus, in the medium-term planning, properly quantifying the future value deposited in carryover storage is essential to achieve a balanced trade-off between immediate benefit and future value. To this end, this paper presents a framework to quantify the future value of carryover storage, which consists of three major steps: i) constructing a deterministic model to calculate the maximum possible hydropower generation that a given level of carryover storage can deliver in the future period; ii) extracting the implicit locational marginal water value (LMWV) of carryover storage for each reservoir by applying a partition-then-extract algorithm to the constructed model; and iii) developing a set of analytical rules based on the extracted LMWV to effectively calculate the future value. These rules can be seamlessly integrated into medium-term CHP planning models as tractable mixed-integer linear constraints to quantify the future value properly, and can be easily visualized to offer valuable insights for CHP operators. Finally, numerical results on Portland General Electric's CHP demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented framework in aiding medium-term CHP planning to identify suitable carryover storage strategies.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Hydrogen Production Dispatch of Networked Hydrogen-Based Microgrids via a Distributed Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884064</link><description>Hydrogen has drawn significant attention due to its long-term storage capability and wide industrial applications. How to efficiently utilize renewable energy to maximize hydrogen production of a group of spatially distributed electrolyzers is a fundamental problem urgently needed to be solved. This paper is the first to attempt to address the problem by proposing a hydrogen production dispatch (HPD) model for hydrogen-based microgrids with proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. Considering the limited communication and privacy requirement of distributed energy systems, a distributed hydrogen production dispatch framework is constructed. The original nonconvex optimization problem is transformed into a convex form. Furthermore, it is proven that the marginal hydrogen production benefit of each electrolyzer should be equal for the optimal hydrogen production dispatch via Lagrangian duality. By setting the marginal hydrogen production benefit as a consensus variable, a novel distributed consensus-based dispatch algorithm is developed, in which an event-triggered communication scheme is introduced to alleviate the communication burden. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm achieves linear convergence. Results of the case study indicate that the proposed strategy yields the optimal hydrogen production benefit, which is increased by 9.43% compared to on-site hydrogen production and demonstrates excellent solving efficiency especially for large-scale systems.</description></item><item><title>Transient Frequency-Voltage Support Strategy for VSC-MTDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farms Based on Perturbation Observer and Funnel Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884062</link><description>To address the transient frequency and voltage stability challenges posed by low-inertia offshore wind farms (OWFs) connected through voltage source converter (VSC) based multi-terminal high voltage direct current (VSC-MTDC) system, a nonlinear perturbation observer and funnel control-based transient frequency and voltage support (PFTFVS) control strategy is proposed for VSC-MTDC integrated OWFs system. This approach utilizes improved estimation ability of the observer and adaptive feature of the funnel controller to enhance transient support capability and disturbance rejection performance of the system. The strategy comprises three parts: 1) an adaptive transient frequency support and rotor speed control method for wind turbines is devised to enhance the frequency support capability of OWFs; 2) considering the energy storage capability of DC capacitor in VSC-MTDC system, a transient frequency support controller is designed for VSC station to swiftly manage transient frequency variations; and 3) utilizing the rapid power regulation ability of VSC-MTDC, a transient voltage support controller is developed for VSC station to enhance voltage stability and boost the power transmission capacity. Finally, dynamic simulations of VSC-MTDC integrated OWFs system are built to verify the validity and robustness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Integration of Electrical Energy Storage in Wave Energy Hardware-in-the-Loop Test Rigs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887246</link><description>This paper presents a design methodology for integrating an electrical energy storage unit into a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test rig for wave energy converters (WECs). Typically, the power production from WECs is characterised by pronounced fluctuations at low frequency and high peaks compared to the average. Wave energy test rigs should be able to reproduce these variations to impose realistic conditions to the device under test. Thus, the grid connection of the rig must be sized to cope with high peaks, and additional measures may be required to avoid disturbances on nearby loads and negative effects on voltage quality. The integration of electrical energy storage can smoothen power fluctuations and mitigate these drawbacks, while resulting in lower installation and operating costs. The design methodology indicates how to effectively size the storage unit and which technology to favour based on the type and duration of test campaigns. Numerical simulation results are presented for a dual HIL test rig and operational profiles of three different WEC technologies. For designs with energy storage lifetime shorter than the calendar life, sensitivity analyses indicate that the rig's annual utilisation rate and the level of accelerated testing have a significant effect on the storage energy requirements.</description></item><item><title>Station-Network Cooperative Optimization Planning of Urban Integrated Energy System Considering Heat Storage Capacity of Heat Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891182</link><description>Heat storage capacity of heat network in urban integrated energy system (UIES) has the potential to significantly improve the operational flexibility of the system. To obtain the optimal UIES planning scheme, a UIES station-network cooperative optimization planning (UIES-SNCOP) method considering heat storage capacity is proposed. First, a heat network operation model under constant flow-variable temperature considering flow direction depiction is established for solving the problem that the existing model cannot be directly applied to UIES-SNCOP because the flow direction of pipeline cannot be predetermined. Then, a radial structure-oriented topology model of distribution and heat networks is developed to ensure the radiality of energy supply network while also reducing planning cost. On this basis, a UIES-SNCOP model based on information gap decision theory and stochastic optimization is constructed to realize the co-optimization of the siting and sizing of energy station and topology of distribution and heat networks. Finally, a solution method of UIES-SNCOP model based on relaxation-contraction coupled McCormick envelope is proposed for effectively improving the accuracy of solution result. The planning of UIES is conducted on an urban topology containing 55 nodes to test the performance of the proposed method, and simulation results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other existing methods in terms of reducing planning cost, ensuring radial structure of the energy supply network, utilizing heat storage capacity and enhancing solution accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Adaptive Robust Model for AC Network-Constrained Unit Commitment in Power Systems With Uncertain Wind Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891662</link><description>With wind power being extensively integrated into power systems, its inherent uncertainty and variability pose significant challenges to the power system operational security. Traditional robust optimization methods capture the worst-case scenario, which results in overly conservative decisions, with insufficient considerations on AC network constraints in power systems. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel adaptive robust AC network-constrained unit commitment (AC-NCUC) model that considers both the AC network security and the uncertainty of wind power output in power systems. More specifically, a convex polyhedral uncertainty set is constructed to characterize the uncertain wind power output. Here, the conservativeness of UC dispatch decisions can be adjusted by modifying the size of the convex polyhedral uncertainty set. Then, we combine Benders&#8217; decomposition and Newton-Raphson methods to solve the AC-NCUC model for the optimal dispatch decisions. Simulation results on the modified IEEE 6-bus and IEEE RTS 79 systems validate the rationality and validity of our proposed approach. The proposed AC-NCUC model effectively maintains the system security while ensuring economic effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Power Control in Wind Farms for Gearbox Load Reduction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891746</link><description>Rapid power and torque fluctuations in time-varying conditions increase the fatigue load and failure rate of wind turbine (WT) gearboxes. In this study, an optimal power control method is proposed for a wind farm (WF) to improve the power flow and service quality, allowing the WF to track the power demand instructions from the transmission system operator while minimizing the fluctuations of vibration displacements inside the gearbox. A comprehensive dynamic model of the gearbox is developed by analyzing the transmission mechanism of key gearbox components, such as the planet carrier, planet gears, sun gears, and spur gears, describing the correlation between the internal vibration and mechanical torque and power output. Then, an optimal power control problem is formulated based on model predictive control to suppress the fatigue load while tracking power. Furthermore, a fatigue evaluation system is built based on the real-time vibration state inside the gearbox to characterize the service quality of WTs and guide the power generation of the WF. This approach provides a safety-oriented boundary regarding the WT fatigue load in the optimal power dispatch issue of WFs to suppress potential WT failures. Case studies in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Deterministic Forecasts and Prediction Intervals for Wind Speed Using Enhanced Multi-Quantile Loss Based Dilated Causal Convolutions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891745</link><description>With rising wind power penetration into power systems obtaining wind speed forecasts with associated uncertainty becomes crucial for better planning and dispatch. This study proposes an enhanced multi quantile regression-based loss function specially tailored to train models to generate both deterministic forecast and the corresponding prediction intervals. Though the regression architecture of the model plays an important role in extracting precise forecasts, however, its efficiency is often ignored which may be a downside for short term forecasting scenarios where model training time may also be a significant factor. The present study therefore designed a multi-scale dilated convolution-based architecture for enhanced efficiency. The architecture generates predictions at different scales which are combined using particle swarm optimization to obtain optimal forecasts. The model is trained using the proposed loss function on datasets from both NREL simulations and operational Chinese state grid measurements across three different locations. The proposed model exhibits excellent forecasting performance in comparative experiments with both simulated and real-world operational datasets.</description></item><item><title>Stability Region Estimation and Decentralized Transient Control for Parallel Grid-Tied Grid-Forming Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892023</link><description>Renewable energyes are highly penetrated in power system through Grid-forming inverter (GFMI). Transient stability of single GFMI system under severe grid fault has been thoroughly analyzed in recent years, but quantitative analysis for parallel grid-tied GFMI system is rarely studied. To fill this gap, the large signal equivalent model of parallel system considering the interaction between inverters is newly built. Based on the model, the Lyapunov function incorporating kinetic energy, potential energy, damping dissipation, and interaction energy is constructed for accurate stability region estimation. Then, the effect of control parameters on stability region is analyzed, indicating that increasing damping, reducing inertia, and lowering reference power of one GFMI can deteriorate stability margin of parallel GFMI system due to the enlarged interaction power, which is distinct from single GFMI system. For this, a decentralized transient control that adaptively adjusts damping, inertia, and reference power is proposed to guarantee transient stability and achieve low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) for parallel system without relying on communication, system information. Finally, simulation and experimental tests validate the correctness of theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of proposed control.</description></item><item><title>Aggregation Feasible Region of Full Power Spectrum Electric Vehicles Based on Polyhedron Projection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10900425</link><description>The aggregation of electric vehicles (EVs) can take full advantage of the power flexibility of EV clusters, based on the aggregation feasible region (AFR) of EVs. However, existing aggregation techniques of conventional distributed energy resources (DERs), exhibit significant inaccuracies or require excessive computational efforts when applied to EVs with high power and small capacity. To solve this problem, an iterative method based on the high dimensional polyhedron projection principle is proposed to derive the exact AFR formula for the full power spectrum of EVs, and the limitations of the existing analytical AFR are revealed. The results reveal that the exact AFR is a set of linear inequalities, whose coefficients can be represented in binary code, and the complexity of the right side is linear with the number of EVs, making it highly conducive to programming calculations. Moreover, this paper proposes a simplified practical AFR based on the exact AFR, which reduces computational complexity. Numerical simulation cases demonstrate that the accuracy of this simplified approach is still higher than that of existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Matrix Adaptive Correction-Based Dynamic Dimensionality Reduction Method for Voltage-Related TSCOPF in Bulk Power Systems With High Wind Power Penetration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902439</link><description>Transient security-constrained optimal power flow (TSCOPF) is an important class of problems for system operation. Several challenges arise when dealing with bulk power grids, including the large size and complex transient voltage behaviors. This paper aims to address such hurdles by proposing a dynamic dimensionality reduction matrix adaptive correction (DDR-MAC) algorithm, which can effectively evaluate proper Volt/Var levels to guarantee secure system operation. First, this paper performs dimensionality reduction processing at the bus and device levels to obtain a low-dimensional model with dominant modes, which solves the problems of high-order and large computational volumes of differential equations. Moreover, a dimensionality reduction error assessment model is established to ensure reduced-order accuracy. Then, the reduced-order TSCOPF model is equivalently decomposed into a mixed-integer linear optimization model and a combined coefficient correction model for system dynamic constraints and steady-state nonlinear constraints. Furthermore, a secant/tangent sensitivity adaptive correction method is presented to achieve fast computation. The DDR-MAC approach is verified across differently scaled IEEE test systems and the Nordic test system and can improve computational efficiency by 49.07% while offering higher accuracy than traditional computation methods.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Synthetic Inertia Control for Two-Area Power Systems With Wind Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10906542</link><description>Modern power systems may experience decrease in stability due to the increased integration of variable generation sources that depend on power electronics converters. A common control strategy is to incorporate synthetic inertia from wind turbines, typically using state-feedback control in a single-area power system model that assumes uniform frequency. As power systems become more interconnected, different frequency behaviors can emerge in multiple areas, casting doubt on current methods that do not consider multi-area stability. Furthermore, most single-area synthetic inertia methods ignore the limitations of communication systems in real power systems. This paper proposes a decentralized synthetic inertia control strategy for a two-area power system with wind power. This approach accounts for the actual behavior of power systems in different areas and the limitations of communication systems in real scenarios. Numerical results, derived from dynamic models using actual operating data from the Chilean Power System, demonstrate that the decentralized control performs comparably to centralized control in maintaining power system stability and optimizing frequency nadir. However, the decentralized control has the advantage of relying solely on local variables, eliminating the need for communication links between areas during operation.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Strategy for Frequency Regulating and MPPT for Photovoltaic Sources Based on a Novel Three-Parameter Characteristic Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10907967</link><description>The large-scale integration of Photovoltaic (PV) sources may reduce system inertia and power quality, resulting in increased frequency fluctuations and diminished system stability due to lack of the primary frequency regulation (FR) capability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified strategy for frequency regulating and Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) for PV sources to provide ancillary services to the power grid. The strategy employs a specifically designed active power control (APC) method to enable rapid and flexible power adjustments of PV sources, with which further FR function may be achieved. The presented APC algorithm adopts an iterative technique with a novel three-parameter PV characteristic curve, making it possible to reconstruct the real-time PV generation model, clarify the relationship between the system frequency, output power, and operating voltage. Its high control accuracy, fast convergence rate, and strong explainability offer significant practical value. Additionally, this adaptive control strategy features autonomous switch between the FR and MPPT modes adapting to real-time irradiation changes, without the need for additional irradiation or temperature sensors. The integration enhances both solar utilization efficiency and the FR capability, while eliminating the controller transitions during operating mode switches. Hardware-in-the-loop tests validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Online Monitoring of Battery Degradation for Enhanced Power Smoothing of PV Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908680</link><description>In pursuit of a carbon-neutral future, the integration of photovoltaic (PV) power plants into the electrical power grid is expanding. Although beneficial, this expansion presents challenges due to weather-induced variability, which destabilizes the grid and causes voltage and frequency deviations. A viable solution is the use of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) alongside PV power plants. However, conventional controllers, which lead to uniform and frequent charging cycles, accelerate degradation and reduce efficiency in BESS. To address this, this paper proposes segmenting the BESS units into distinct charging and discharging groups, effectively minimizing battery cycling and enhancing their lifespan. The controller dynamically assigns batteries to each group based on power fluctuation forecasts using a power-sharing model. This model manages battery activation, enables inter-group support, and balances degradation by monitoring BESS charge levels and assessing battery health through an online system. This controller, coupled with a degradation balancing layer, strategically prioritizes units based on their cycling age. The proposed technique was rigorously tested and experimentally validated, demonstrating that it significantly reduces battery degradation to a maximum of 0.099%, in stark contrast to the up to 4.41% observed with conventional controllers.</description></item><item><title>State Transfer Induced Transient Synchronization Instability of GFM-VSC: Analysis and Improvement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909647</link><description>The operation mode of grid-forming voltage source converters (GFM-VSCs) may switch between voltage source mode (VSM) and current source mode (CSM) under some situations such as grid faults, owing to the current limitation control. During the mode-switching process, there is state transfer from the final state of the last mode to the initial state of the next mode, which impacts the transient synchronization stability (TSS) of GFM-VSCs. This paper primarily focuses on analyzing and improving the TSS of GFM-VSCs by considering the effect of state transfer. A novel transient instability mechanism is revealed through the existence analysis of equilibrium points. It clarifies that the state transfer may cause the operating trajectory during faults to bypass the stable equilibrium point in CSM before diverging to the next cycle, thereby resulting in transient synchronization instability. Besides, to further analyze the TSS of mode-switched VSCs considering the dynamics during faults, multiple Lyapunov functions are adopted to derive the TSS criteria and boundaries. It has been identified that lowering the minimum critical current and adjusting the saturated current phase in accordance with virtual power angle (VPA) dynamics can enhance the TSS. Therefore, a VPA feedback-based current limiting strategy is proposed to safeguard GFM-VSCs against overcurrent and ensure the TSS. The validity of the new transient instability mechanism and the efficacy of the proposed strategy are confirmed through simulations of a GFM-VSC connected to an IEEE 39-bus power grid and hardware-in-the-loop experiments.</description></item><item><title>Assessing Dynamic Reserves vs. Stochastic Optimization for Effective Integration of Operating Probabilistic Forecasts</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909649</link><description>Probabilistic forecasting is becoming pivotal in utilities' decision-making processes, offering an accurate portrayal of plausible forecast deviations as opposed to deterministic forecasting which only focuses on the expected forecasted variables. Two methods, dynamic reserve and stochastic optimization, have been used to integrate probabilistic forecasts into power system operational planning. Dynamic reserve predicts system reserve requirements based on observed (from historical observations) or expected (from probabilistic forecasts) uncertainty spreads. This approach has a low computational burden, but it is commitment and dispatch agnostic. Stochastic optimization, on the other hand, considers multiple scenarios simultaneously (from probabilistic forecasts), allocating recourse across the commitment and dispatch variables, but demanding high computational resources and time. The selection between these methods depends on utility requirements and specific situations. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of both methods using a calibrated real-size system representing the Southern Company for medium and high solar penetration levels. Additionally, it proposes a hybrid dynamic reserve and stochastic optimization approach with a risk evaluation pre-scheduling procedure to enhance decision-making.</description></item><item><title>Minimax Regret Robust Co-Planning of Transmission and Energy Storage Systems With Mixed Integer Recourse</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909558</link><description>The growing penetration of renewable energy sources, with intermittent and uncertain nature, brings new challenges to the secure and efficient operation of power systems. Expanding transmission networks and utilizing energy storage (ES) have been introduced as effective solutions to address these challenges. This paper presents a minimax regret robust co-planning model with mixed integer recourse for transmission and ES systems, designed from the perspective of a central planner. The model considers a polyhedral uncertainty set for future peak load growth, while uncertainties in wind farm expansion are addressed through internal scenario analysis. This approach will guarantee the robustness of investment decisions and provide the central planner with a clear picture of the maximum regret among all possible scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed minimax regret framework facilitates strategic planning for ES installation after the resolution of long-term uncertainties. In this paper, we reformulate the model into a standard min-max-min problem, in which the maximization level is only over uncertainties. Subsequently, a five-level solution strategy based on a modified nested column and constraint generation decomposition technique is represented to deal with the intractability and complexity of the problem caused by binary variables of transmission lines and ES blocks. The model is finally evaluated through comprehensive simulation studies to verify its tractability, practicality, and effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic Model-Based Minute-Level Optimal Operation Strategy for Alkaline Electrolyzers in Wind-Hydrogen Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912757</link><description>Maintaining the export power of wind-hydrogen systems within a stable range is critical for power system security. However, this is challenged by the mismatch between large time-scale of alkaline electrolyzer (AWE) scheduling strategies and the short-term fluctuations of wind power. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel minute-level optimization strategy for AWE operation. Developing effective small time-scale strategies requires a detailed consideration of AWE dynamics. To this end, we first introduce its steady-state electrochemical characteristics and third-order dynamic models for both temperature and Hydrogen-to-Oxygen (HTO) ratio. Based on these refined models, we develop an AWE optimization framework that enables electrolysis power to track minute-level wind power fluctuations by dynamically adjusting fine-grained variables, such as the lye flow rate, cooling flow rate, and pressure, at 1-minute intervals. To overcome the computational challenges posed by the detailed modeling, we propose an improved model predictive control (MPC) framework. This framework incorporates model simplifications to improve computational efficiency, along with an optimization-simulation iterative procedure to ensure operational feasibility. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed strategy extends the AWE load range by 13.8% and reduces wind power curtailment by 15.06%. Additionally, synergies among control variables enable the system to achieve a balance between operational efficiency, stability, and security, highlighting the potential of this approach to enhance the performance of wind-hydrogen integrated systems.</description></item><item><title>Promote Data Sharing in Integrated Power-Traffic Networks: A Coalition Game Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10910214</link><description>Accurately estimating spatial-temporal electric vehicles' (EVs) charging demands is crucial for the secure and economic operation of power systems. At present, the distribution system operator (DSO) relies on historical data collected at each charging station to estimate future EV charging demand. However, the station-level forecast disregards EVs' spatial correlations within traffic networks (TNs) and might suffer significant forecast error, forcing the DSO to make conservative scheduling at the expense of operation economics. To this end, this paper proposes to leverage cross-sector information (i.e., traffic demand data and network parameters in TNs) to enhance forecast accuracy and avoid over-conservative operations. To facilitate the data sharing among the DSO and TN data holders (i.e., traffic authority and navigation App. companies), we adopt the Coalition Game theory to uncover how these entities could cooperate to benefit each other, and to fairly allocate the extra profits (i.e., the operational cost reduction induced by the improved forecasts) among themselves. The conditional value-at-risk theory is adopted to model the risk-averse behavior of the DSO. In case studies, we reveal the non-negligible impact of TN condition variations on EV charging distributions. Moreover, numerical results show that sharing high-quality traffic data contributes to the reduction in DSO's operating cost by utmost 20.8% as compared to the current practice without data sharing.</description></item><item><title>An Optimization Framework for Component Sizing and Energy Management in Electric-Hydrogen Hybrid Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10915713</link><description>This paper proposes an optimization framework to address the component sizing and energy management problems in an electric-hydrogen hybrid energy storage system connected to a wind turbine. The total cost of the hybrid system is minimized using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In particular, four decision variables are optimized: the electrolyzer (EL) size, the supercapacitor (SC) size, and two parameters in the energy management strategy (EMS). To determine the power split factor for the wind power, the EMS introduces an artificial potential field (APF) and defines a virtual force based on the SC state of charge (SOC). Two APF parameters are optimized to tune the power allocation between the EL and the SC: the shaping parameter of the virtual force and the basis parameter of the power split factor. Since the cutoff frequency of the low pass filter (LPF) in the EMS is adaptively updated based on the optimized APF parameters, the proposed framework is referred to as the &#8220;OP-APF&#8221; framework. The effectiveness of the OP-APF framework is validated by performing MATLAB and real-time simulations. Compared to three baseline frameworks, OP-APF is more effective in reducing the system total cost, controlling the SC SOC, and alleviating the EL degradation.</description></item><item><title>Photovoltaic Power Prediction Considering Multifactorial Dynamic Effects: A Dynamic Locally Featured Embedding-Based Broad Learning System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916943</link><description>Accurate photovoltaic power (PVP) prediction is a prerequisite for the efficient and stable operation of new power systems. While existing research has extensively explored the relationship between global factors such as temperature, irradiance, and photovoltaic power, the local dynamic impacts of these factors are often overlooked, which may reduce the accuracy of predictions. To address this issue, this paper considers the dynamic interrelationships among multiple factors and proposes a dynamic locally featured embedding-based broad learning system (DLFE-BLS) algorithm for PVP prediction. Firstly, a novel dynamic phase space reconstruction method (DPSR) is proposed to characterize the dynamic properties of multivariate data. Furthermore, a dynamic local featured embedding (DLFE) algorithm is introduced to extract local dynamic features from multivariate data. Finally, by integrating the dynamic reconstruction and dynamic feature extraction processes into the broad learning system (BLS) framework, we propose the DLFE-BLS algorithm to improve the accuracy of PVP prediction. Case studies have shown that DLFE-BLS outperforms other models in terms of prediction accuracy. Additionally, it has the highest accuracy when applied to transfer prediction.</description></item><item><title>Optimal VSG BESS Sizing for Improving Grid-Following Converter Stability Under Various Dispatch Scenarios and Grid Strengths</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924310</link><description>As renewable energy integration increases, ensuring stability of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) in weak grids is crucial, as grid-following (GFL) converters often become unstable under such conditions. Integrating virtual synchronous generator (VSG) batteries has shown potential to improve GFL stability, but determining the optimal size of the VSG required for stability remains an open question. Existing research typically relies on small-signal or impedance models for stability analysis, which are only valid at a single operating point and do not consider the full range of operating conditions, including various dispatch scenarios and grid strengths. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel methodology to visualize the system's stable operating region, offering insights into stability boundaries across various real power and grid impedance variations. Additionally, it introduces an optimal VSG battery sizing strategy that accounts for these variations, ensuring stability while minimizing VSG capacity. The strategy's effectiveness is validated through comprehensive PSCAD simulations, demonstrating its reliability across a wide range of real power and grid impedance operating points.</description></item><item><title>Fast Centralized Model Predictive Control for Wave Energy Converter Arrays Based on Rollout</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10923686</link><description>Centralized control of wave energy converter (WEC) arrays for grid-scale generation can achieve higher energy production than decentralized (independent) control, due to its capability of fully exploiting mutual radiation effects. However, the state-of-the-art centralized model predictive control (CMPC) is significantly more computationally challenging than decentralized MPC (DMPC), since the number of control moves to be optimized grows in proportion to the number of WECs. In this paper, a fast CMPC controller is proposed, whose idea is to optimize only the first few control moves while rolling out future system trajectories using a fixed controller. A linear, two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) controller with a sea-state-dependent control coefficient tuning strategy is further proposed to serve as the rollout controller. It is shown that the proposed rollout-based CMPC (R-CMPC) can maintain almost the same energy production as conventional CMPC under a wide range of sea states, while significantly reducing the optimization dimension (in the studied case, by a factor of 6), enabling ultra-fast online computation (about 40 times faster than conventional CMPC).</description></item><item><title>Energy Management of Multi-Energy Communities: A Hierarchical MIQP-Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10923740</link><description>This paper proposes a hybrid mixed-integer quadratic programming-constrained deep reinforcement learning (MIQP-CDRL) framework for energy management of multi-energy communities. The framework employs a hierarchical two-layer structure: the MIQP layer handles day-ahead scheduling, minimizing operational costs while ensuring system constraint satisfaction, while the CDRL agent makes real-time adjustments. The goal of this framework is to combine the strengths of CDRL in addressing sequential decision-making problems in stochastic systems with the advantages of a mathematical programming model to guide the agent's exploration during the training and reduce the dependency on opaque policies during real-time operation. The system dynamics are modeled as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), which is solved by a model-free CDRL agent built upon the constrained policy optimization (CPO) algorithm. Practical test results demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in improving the optimality and feasibility of the real-time solutions compared to existing stand-alone DRL approaches.</description></item><item><title>Complex Variable Design for Power Control of Grid-Forming Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854804</link><description>The analysis and design of the grid-forming (GFM) power loop and decoupling control can be challenging due to the coupled high-order system, where active and reactive power controls are typically designed separately using a dual-input-dual-output model.

Managing frequency, voltage, and power dynamics in microgrids under varying conditions, however, poses significant challenges. This paper proposes an adaptive, data-driven secondary control framework for real-time tuning of hierarchical controllers in both islanded and grid-connected modes. The approach employs a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) method with a novel low-memory formulation optimized for digital signal processor (DSP) implementation. Integrated with a performance detector, it enables automated controller retuning during open- and closed-loop operations, ensuring robust reference tracking and dynamic performance under disturbances.

The results highlight the proposed method&#8217;s practical applicability, offering a scalable solution for microgrid management in real-world conditions.</description></item><item><title>Uninterruptable Hierarchical Distributed Coordinated Control Scheme of Islanded AC/DC Microgrid Clusters Under Grid-Forming Converter Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10974648</link><description>Grid-forming converter faults in islanded hybrid AC/DC microgrid clusters could lead to voltage and frequency instability risk in the subgrid, thus threatening system operating safety. To solve this issue, this paper has proposed an uninterruptable hierarchical distributed coordinated control scheme of islanded hybrid AC/DC microgrid clusters. Firstly, when grid-forming converter faults occur in a certain AC microgrid (ACMG), the interlinking converter connected with the faulty subgrid switches its control mode into grid-forming, providing stable voltage and frequency support for the faulty ACMG. Then, a two-layer coordinated control scheme is presented, where the first layer is designed for the remaining interlinking converters, and the second layer is designed for converters in normal subgrids and grid-following converters in abnormal ACMG together with its interlinking converter. By the control mode switch of the IC and the two-layer coordinated control scheme, accurate power sharing can quickly fill the power deficit in the faulty subgrid, and the voltage and frequency of the microgrid clusters can remain stable. Verification results indicate that with the proposed scheme, the islanded AC/DC microgrid clusters can operate uninterruptedly under different kinds of grid-forming converter faults.</description></item><item><title>Robust Consensus-Based Secondary Control for Microgrids Considering Communication Delay and Noises: A Kalman Filter-Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994544</link><description>To achieve the frequency and voltage regulation as well as active and reactive power sharing, the consensus-based secondary controls of microgrids rely on communication network to exchange signals between neighbor inverters, which may be affected by the communication delay and noises. Unlike the existing methods that focus solely on communication delay, this paper proposes a Kalman filter-based robust consensus control to address the communication delay and noises comprehensively. Based on the discrete differential equation of the signal transmitted via communication network, the multi-step prediction model of the delayed signal is firstly built by considering the prediction errors. The state space model is then constructed by taking the predicted signals at each step as the state variables while the delayed and noise-involved signal and its differential value are seen as the measurements. A Kalman filter is further designed to comprehensively handle the communication delay, noises and prediction errors to estimate the true signal generated from neighbor inverters. With the estimated signals of all neighbor inverters, the consensus control is performed to coordinate the grid-following and grid-forming inverters within the microgrid. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with simulations and experiments performed on the modified IEEE-33 bus-based microgrid.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Directional Protection Element for Converter-Based Islanded Hybrid Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11006132</link><description>This paper proposes a unified directional element (UDE) for protecting converter-dominated islanded hybrid microgrids (IHMGs) relying on phase current samples. For the AC sub-network, the fault diagnosis component (FDC) is constructed by averaging the first-order derivative (FOD) of the phase currents at each line end over one power cycle. On the DC side, the FDC is obtained directly by computing the FOD of the pole current. The current direction of each phase/pole can be identified based on the first peak sign of the FDC. Once a disturbance occurs, the UDE is activated utilizing a startup unit, and the first peak sign of the FDC of each phase/pole is shared between both terminals of the line to differentiate internal faults from other disturbances or external faults. A phase/pole is being faulted if both values of the FDC at both sides of the line have the same sign. The developed UDE is verified by simulating the modified IEEE 33-bus IHMG on PSCAD/EMTDC. Several scenarios are carried out including load switching as well as external and internal faults. Additionally, the effect of different factors is examined, encompassing measurement inaccuracies and high resistance faults.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Power Flow Estimation for MVDC Distribution Systems Based on Physics-Embedded FCN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945791</link><description>Maintaining high prediction accuracy with varying grid topologies poses a significant challenge to adopting neural network (NN)-based approaches for power flow (PF) estimation in medium-voltage direct current (MVDC) distribution systems. This paper proposes a physics-embedded fully convolutional network (PEFCN) to improve the accuracy. Physics-embedded techniques are incorporated in the proposed PEFCN through 1) architecture reconstruction, and 2) loss function reformulation. Architecture is reconstructed by input channel conversion calculation in a new physics operation layer. This process offers physical connections among the three input matrix channels (voltage, current, and line conductance). Three new physics loss terms are included in the loss function to restrict the outliers violating the limits of converter power ratings and terminal MVDC voltages. The two operations enable the FCN to achieve improved prediction accuracy and strong generalization capabilities. Five MVDC distribution systems, characterized by different dc voltage levels and topology configurations, serve to validate the superiority of the proposed PEFCN over other NNs in the PF estimation for scenarios involving both fixed and varying system structures. Moreover, a modified IEEE 69-bus distribution system is further used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed PEFCN for larger systems.</description></item><item><title>Non-Iterative Sensitivity-Based Switch Exchange Method for Distribution Network Reconfiguration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10960360</link><description>In this paper, a non-iterative sensitivity-based zsolve the distribution network reconfiguration (DNR) problem and ensure the security of the switch operation process, while maintaining the node voltage within the feasible range. The NSSE method involved the sensitivity-based network reconfiguration (SNR) stage and sensitivity-based power optimization (SPO) stage. In the SNR stage, the computational speed was improved by considering the dynamic voltage sensitivity with respect to the compensated power analysis, while the network power losses and number of switching times were minimized. The closed-loop and open-loop operation model was developed to solve the compensated power for simulating the switch operation process. Moreover, the maximum loop current was set as a constraint to avoid the equipment risk of switching operation. Each switch operation process can be formulated as integer quadratic programming (IQP) to obtain the optimal network topology and switch operation sequence with the non-iterative calculations. In the SPO stage, the active and reactive power outputs of distributed generations (DGs) were optimized to regulate the node voltage and reduce the active power curtailment. The effectiveness of the proposed NSSE method on the calculation speed and accuracy was validated in MATLAB.</description></item><item><title>Multiagent System-Based VPPs Cooperative Power Control for Frequency Regulation Considering Diverse Communication Issues</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948420</link><description>Virtual power plants (VPPs) possess significant potential to support power systems&#8217; frequency regulation through the aggregation of demand-side distributed energy resources. However, due to their heavy reliance on information technology, VPPs inevitably face diverse communication issues, such as cyber-attacks, privacy disclosure, and packet losses, which poses a serious challenge to ensure efficient power control for frequency regulation. To this end, this paper proposes a multiagent system-based VPPs cooperative power control strategy to achieve frequency regulation in a resilient, optimal, and scalable manner. First, a joint design scheme of VPPs cooperative power control and information interaction mechanism is presented to determine the optimal regulation power of VPPs for frequency regulation, where a consensus-based collaborative strategy is designed for cyber-attacks and a homomorphic encryption technology is introduced for privacy protection. Also, an event-triggered mechanism is adopted for communication burden. Second, a dynamic power control scheme for inverter is presented to enable the internal units of VPPs to track the power reference from the joint design scheme, in which an improved model predictive control method is suggested for packet losses to enhance control performance. Finally, simulation results reveal that, when confronting diverse communication issues, the proposed strategy exhibits significant effects in defending against cyber-attacks, ensuring privacy security, alleviating the communication burden, and achieving fast response, thus effectively facilitating VPPs frequency regulation.</description></item><item><title>Voltage-Source Control for Green-Hydrogen Hybrid Energy Storage System With Operational Constraints and Current Rate Limiter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947357</link><description>Green hydrogen produced from renewable energy generation (RES) is facilitating the energy transition. Due to the complicated operational constraints of green-hydrogen hybrid energy storage system (GH-HESS), the existing two-layer power-based control architecture is prevalent, but it heavily relies on the communication infrastructure and the prediction accuracy of RES&#8217;s power. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel voltage-source hierarchical control framework for the grid-connected GH-HESS to solve the above problems. Considering the electricity price, the hot-standby current and safety of the hydrogen production of the electrolyzer, the current allocation between hydrogen energy storage and power grid is achieved for the continuous stable operation of GH-HESS even in the situation with potential communication failure. When the current rate limiter is adopted for the fuel starvation phenomenon of fuel cell, the current feed-forward loop and current-based secondary control are designed to solve the trade-off problem between the current overshoot and convergence speed of the tradition voltage-source control, where the large current overshoot will cause irreversible damage to hydrogen energy storage. Battery energy storage rapidly responses the power fluctuation from RES, while the steady-state power vacancy is undertaken by hydrogen energy storage. Finally, a 800V DC microgrid based on NI-PXI real-time platform is built to validate its advantages.</description></item><item><title>Reliability and Comfort-Aware Operation Optimization for Hydrogen-Based Building Energy Systems in Off-Grid Mode</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965864</link><description>Hydrogen-based energy systems have gained wide attention due to their significant potential for relieving energy crises and environmental problems. However, existing studies neglect occupant comfort control in hydrogen-based building energy systems (HBESs). In this paper, we investigate a reliability and comfort-aware operation optimization problem of an HBES in off-grid mode. Achieving the above aim encounters several challenges due to multi-source uncertainties, implicit indoor environmental dynamics, temporally and spatially coupled constraints, and nonlinear constraints. To address the above challenges, we propose a physics-embedded neural network (PENN)-assisted hierarchical model predictive control (MPC) algorithm. Specifically, the PENN architecture is adopted to capture the indoor dynamics accurately. Then, the PENN-assisted upper-level MPC implements occupant comfort control and optimizes the multi-energy demands. Next, the lower-level MPC optimizes the system operation cost and reliability with known multi-energy demands decided by the upper-level MPC. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms baselines in terms of operation cost, system reliability, and indoor occupant comfort.</description></item><item><title>Exploring the Feasible Regulation Region of Building HVAC Systems Within Hygro-Thermal Comfort</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11006322</link><description>Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems are widely recognized as promising demand response (DR) resources for enhancing grid flexibility. Despite extensive research on evaluating the regulation capacity of HVAC systems, the role of humidity in air dynamic description and occupant comfort assessment during DR has been overlooked. This paper addresses these gaps by exploring the feasible regulation region of HVAC systems while meeting occupant hygro-thermal comfort. Firstly, a comprehensive model of HVAC systems is developed to describe the hygro-thermal air dynamics and equipment characteristics. Subsequently, the hygro-thermal comfort area is defined to establish permissible temperature and humidity boundaries. Based on key constraints, the hygro-thermal air dynamics are categorized into 3 distinct types. Moreover, a novel criterion is proposed to identify these dynamics without requiring full knowledge of boundary conditions. On this basis, the maximum regulation capacities are quantitatively evaluated to explore the feasible regulation region throughout the day. Finally, numerical case studies are conducted to validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that humidity plays a crucial role in the operating power and the feasible regulation region of HVAC systems. Incorporating humidity improves hygro-thermal comfort, thereby encouraging more occupant participation in DR programs.</description></item><item><title>Automated Fast Frequency Response From Inverter-Based Motor Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002578</link><description>The increasing integration of inverter-based renewable generation presents challenges for the frequency stability of power systems, primarily due to reduced system inertia and governor response&#8212;collectively known as Fast Frequency Response (FFR). Obtaining FFR from inverter-based generation requires reserving operational headroom, resulting in a lost opportunity to generate more renewable energy. Recently, inverter-based loads have been proposed as potential sources of FFR; however, critical gaps remain in the control algorithms needed to transform these loads into grid-supportive loads (GSLs) capable of delivering FFR. To address this gap, this paper introduces a novel algorithm that enables automatic, communication-free, grid-supportive behavior in inverter-based motor loads. The algorithm&#8217;s efficacy is demonstrated through comprehensive simulations and hardware experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that GSLs equipped with the proposed controller can provide FFR by adjusting power consumption, reducing it by up to 32% for a 1.8% drop in grid frequency and increasing it by 10.65% for a 0.4% rise, within 1.5 seconds in response to frequency events. By retrofitting existing, or designing new inverter-based motor loads with this controller, end-use devices can automatically deliver aggregated FFR without communication infrastructure, enhancing frequency stability in grids with high levels of variable renewable energy.</description></item><item><title>Bayesian Active Learning-Based Soft Data Space Calibration for System-Wise Aggregate Flexibility Characterization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945771</link><description>There have been growing interests in characterizing system-wide aggregate flexibility to support transmission-side ancillary services and promote large-scale integration of distributed energy resources (DERs). However, accurately characterizing the power flexibility region (PFR) at the substation interface is computationally challenging due to the heterogeneity of the DER devices and the need to satisfy network constraints, resulting in a nonlinear and unpredictable geometry. Therefore, this paper proposes a network-aware, near-optimal, and sample-efficient data-driven method. First, a bus-level PFR estimation model is proposed to aggregate local DER devices at each bus into an inner-box approximated region. Second, a feeder-level PFR estimation model is proposed to aggregate all bus-level PFRs into an outer-box approximated region. A Bayesian active learning-based soft calibration strategy is proposed to iteratively and interactively learn a decision boundary of the binary classifier as an improved feeder-level PFR while providing trustworthy measurement to system operators. Case studies on a small, illustrative IEEE system and modified IEEE 123 bus test feeder validate effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description></item><item><title>Aggregated DER_A Model Parameterization via Online Moving Horizon Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945798</link><description>This paper introduces a methodology for parameterizing the DER_A model using a novel smooth mathematical representation, simplifying the process and preserving accuracy in modeling inverter-based generator (IBG). The methodology employs an online parameterization process that can operate in real-time. The model parameterization process is structured into five sequential steps, each targeting a specific aspect of the DER_A model through moving horizon estimation. This approach adapts to systems with varying voltage and frequency support requirements by selectively applying each step. Simulation results on systems with both known and unknown parameters validate the methodology&#8217;s effectiveness. The online moving horizon estimation technique accurately captures the dynamics of the overall system and ensures that the parameterized DER_A model closely mirrors the real system&#8217;s voltage, current, and power dynamics. The findings highlight the potential of this methodology to substantially improve and simplify the dynamic modeling of power systems, paving the way for more reliable and robust IBG and grid integration.</description></item><item><title>Network-Security Informed Offer-Making of Aggregator With Utility-Owned Storage Lease Opportunity: Robust Stackelberg Game and Distributed Solution Methods</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10974673</link><description>Aggregators of distributed energy resources are increasingly encouraged to participate in wholesale market bidding. However, the delivery of the power they are awarded can result in over-voltage or congestion issues within the distribution network (DN). The opportunity to lease energy storage from the utility that manages the DN provides the aggregator with a means to mitigate these issues, while also benefiting the utility in terms of additional lease revenue. Nevertheless, this leasing opportunity considerably complicates the aggregator&#8217;s offer-making process, as it requires the consideration of market uncertainties, uncertain power injection at DN buses, and the strategic interactions between the aggregator and the utility. This paper presents a robust Stackelberg game model that effectively captures the interactions between the aggregator and the utility, ensuring DN security across all potential uncertainty scenarios. Furthermore, in light of the privacy concerns of both the aggregator and the utility, two distributed solution methods are proposed. The first method follows a traditional predict-then-optimize framework and has been validated to achieve the game equilibrium. The second method employs an end-to-end framework, which has been empirically shown to yield superior economic results. Case studies conducted on 69 and 533-bus DNs illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.</description></item><item><title>New Insights on the Stability of Sampled-Data-Based LFC for Power Systems: A Delay-Interval-Dependent LKF Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981893</link><description>This paper analyzes the stability problem of load frequency control (LFC) for power systems under uncertain transmission delays. First, an argumented LFC system model accounting for uncertainties in transmission delays is proposed. Then, a novel delay-interval-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) that takes into account both the upper and lower bounds of the transmission delay is proposed. Several less conservative stability criteria are derived using the proposed LKF. Based on the stability criterion obtained, the sampling interval and the upper and lower bounds of the transmission delay are taken as the conditions to guide the controller design. Finally, case studies are conducted based on a one-area power system and a three-area power system, both integrated with wind and solar power generation. The simulation comparison results demonstrate that the proposed LFC scheme exhibits strong robustness against uncertain transmission delays, load fluctuations, and the intermittent generation of wind and solar power.</description></item><item><title>Advancing Privacy-Preserving Wind Generation Forecasts With Selective Spatial-Temporal Dependencies Extraction, Encryption and Sharing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988895</link><description>The adoption of renewable energy sources (RES) is essential for accelerating the low-carbon transition. Accurate forecasting of renewable energy generation is vital for its effective integration into power systems, allowing for mitigation on variability and intermittency of RES and facilitating economic and secure grid operation. In this context, collaborative wind generation forecasting task faces multiple challenges, including secure information sharing, spatial-temporal dependencies characterization and utilization, as well as uncertainty quantification via probabilistic forecasting. To this end, this paper proposes a novel collaborative forecasting framework which features 4 core functionalities: a temporal convolutional network-autoencoder based secure data encryption and temporal dependencies extraction module; a self-attention based secure data sharing and selective spatial-temporal dependencies extraction module; a privacy-preserving collaborative point/probabilistic forecasting module based on improved pinball loss function; and an adaptive fine-tuning procedure to further leverage feature extraction performance and prediction accuracy through joint training. Case studies using real-world data from 10 wind farms located across Jiangsu province, China, validated superior performance of the proposed method while highlighting the value of the developed functionalities. The proposed collaborative forecasting method achieves 18.21%, 15.23%, 8.69% improvement in RMSE compared to the worst-performing baseline method, in benchmarking against individual forecasting, pre-training only and statistical pre-screening based methods. Furthermore, a maximum 26.62% improvement in Coverage Width-based Criterion is attained with respect to parametric and non-parametric baseline methods.</description></item><item><title>Robust Microgrid Dispatch With Real-Time Energy Sharing and Endogenous Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10999049</link><description>With the rising adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs), microgrid dispatch is facing new challenges: DER owners are independent stakeholders seeking to maximize their individual profits rather than being controlled centrally; and the dispatch of renewable generators may affect the microgrid&#8217;s exposure to uncertainty. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a two-stage robust microgrid dispatch model with real-time energy sharing and endogenous uncertainty. In the day-ahead stage, the connection/disconnection of renewable generators is optimized, which influences the size and dimension of the uncertainty set. As a result, the uncertainty set is endogenously given. In addition, non-anticipative operational bounds for energy storage (ES) are derived to enable the online operation of ES in real-time. In the real-time stage, DER owners (consumers and prosumers) share energy with each other via a proposed energy sharing mechanism, which forms a generalized Nash game. To solve the robust microgrid dispatch model, we develop an equivalent optimization model to compute the real-time energy sharing equilibrium. Based on this, a projection-based column-and-constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) method is proposed to handle the endogenous uncertainty. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed model and method.</description></item><item><title>Systematic Design of Active Power Control Parameters for Multi-VSG Systems Based on Active Power Separation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003181</link><description>According to emerging guidelines, system operators are increasingly emphasizing three critical performance aspects from grid-forming (GFM) plants: active power-frequency (P-f) droop, low-frequency oscillation (LFO) damping, and active power setpoint tracking (APST) bandwidth. In GFM plants implemented by multiple virtual synchronous generators (VSGs), these performance aspects are dominated by VSGs&#8217; active power control (APC) parameters, i.e., the inertia constant H and damping coefficient D. However, an APC parameter design with these performance aspects comprehensively considered remains unexplored, potentially leading to inappropriate P-f droop, underdamped LFOs, or excessive APST bandwidth. To address this issue, first, by separating the multi-VSG system&#8217;s active power responses into a common part and a differential part, the analytical expressions for its LFO damping ratio and APST bandwidth are derived. Second, by aligning these performance aspects with the requirements outlined in representative GFM plant guidelines, a systematic APC parameter design method is proposed. This method explicitly formulates the feasible region for the APC parameters that ensures appropriate P-f droop, LFO damping, and APST bandwidth. Finally, real-time simulations and experiments are conducted in various multi-VSG systems to validate the theoretical analysis and the proposed APC parameter design method.</description></item><item><title>A Bi-Level Nash Bargaining Model for Electricity Trading Among Microgrids With Endogenous Nodal Prices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11006478</link><description>Determining a fair trading price is challenging, and this complexity is further heightened in power systems as the price must consider network constraints, fluctuating and endogenous electricity prices, and generation cost. This paper proposes a novel Nash-in-Stackelberg model designed to coordinate a collection of independently operated microgrids. Within this framework, the microgrids engage in a bargaining game to collectively decide a fair trading price as well as other operational decisions. We use the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) to model this interaction. Microgrids&#8217; trading decisions impact the locational marginal prices of the main power grid. Hence, a Stackelberg game is used to determine these prices. The Stackelberg model considers microgrids as leaders (upper-level problem) and the independent system operator as follower (lower-level problem). The NBS guarantees a fair allocation of the generated profit based on individual characteristics of the microgrids. In specific, in scenarios of higher generation, we achieve a cost reduction of  ${\$}$ 884 and  ${\$}$ 904 per microgrid compared with a grand coalition where only one microgrid receives the total cost reduction ( ${\$}$ 1788). Also we noticed that increasing the amount of solar-generated electricity reduces the nodal price in 1.53% and consequently the trading price in 1.27%.</description></item><item><title>Optimal PMU Placement via Quantum Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980373</link><description>Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are essential for real-time monitoring and improving grid observability. Determining the optimal PMU installation is critical, especially as the penetration of renewable energy resources increases, as the Optimal PMU Placement (OPMUP) can guarantee full system observability and reduce the installation cost. However, identifying the optimal PMU installation is a prototypical combinatorial optimization problem, requiring substantial classical computational resources. Furthermore, the significant expansion of the grid in terms of renewable energy integration makes the determination of optimal PMU placement increasingly computationally intensive. In this work, a hybrid quantum-classical approach, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), is developed to effectively solve the optimal PMU installation problem under normal and channel limitation scenarios. A tailored objective function is proposed for quantum optimization, which takes into account both PMU placement cost and system observability constraints. To analyze the observability of QAOA-generated solution distributions, recursion-based Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search algorithms are proposed for normal and channel-limited scenarios. These methods determine solution feasibility on classical computers with  $\mathcal {O}(N+M)$  complexity, outperforming the  $\mathcal {O}(N^{2})$  complexity of inequality-based approaches, where N and M denote the number of buses and branches, respectively. In addition, the proposed quantum optimization framework can significantly reduce the computational complexity from the polynomial or exponential levels required by previous classical methods, i.e.,  $\mathcal {O}(RN)$  on quantum circuits and  $\mathcal {O}(R(M+N))$  on classical resources, where R is the repetition times of quantum circuits executions. The proposed method is tested on IEEE 9-, 14-, 24-, and 30-bus systems, where better installation results are achieved compared to the state-of-the-art results, providing a new baseline for further quantum studies in OPMUP. Furthermore, a landscape optimization strategy is introduced to improve QAOA solution quality. This approach also reduces the time cost of quantum computing resources, making it more efficient for current quantum applications. Additionally, parameter studies are conducted to identify key factors influencing QAOA performance. This work is expected to lay the foundations for addressing challenging power system problems through quantum technology in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Operation and Control Schemes of Retired Batteries in DC Microgrid for Secondary Usage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964325</link><description>The utilization of repurposed second-life batteries from electric vehicles in DC microgrids presents a sustainable and cost-effective solution. However, efficiently integrating these batteries within DC microgrids poses two main challenges: (1) poor consistency among retired battery packs; (2) fluctuations in the DC bus voltage. Traditional approaches primarily focus on achieving the state of charge (SOC) balancing within retired battery packs, often neglecting the suppression of voltage fluctuations, thereby compromising system stability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a virtual DC machine (VDCM)-based control strategy that enhances both the power quality of the DC microgrid and the consistency of retired battery packs. On the one hand, reconfigurable topology and SOC balancing strategies are developed to manage the equalization current, achieving SOC balancing within the retired battery packs. On the other hand, a VDCM strategy is designed to leverage the capacity characteristics of retired batteries to increase the inertia of the DC microgrid. Compared to conventional methods, experimental results show that the proposed strategy not only maintains SOC balancing during both the charging and discharging phases but also significantly reduces overshoot and settle times of dc voltage to 64.2% and 55.6%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>V2Sim: An Open-Source Microscopic V2G Simulation Platform in Urban Power and Transportation Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10970754</link><description>This paper proposes V2Sim, an open source Python-based simulation platform designed for advanced vehicle-to-grid (V2G) analysis in coupled urban power and transportation networks. By integrating a microscopic urban transportation network (MUTN) with a power distribution network (PDN), V2Sim enables precise modeling of electric vehicle charging loads (EVCL) and dynamic V2G operations. The platform uniquely combines SUMO for MUTN simulations and an optimized DistFlow model for PDN analysis, with dedicated models for fast charging stations (FCS) and slow charging stations (SCS), capturing detailed charging dynamics often overlooked in existing simulation tools. V2Sim supports a range of customizable V2G strategies, advanced fault-sensing in charging stations, and parallel simulation through multi-processing to accelerate large-scale case studies. Case studies using a real-world MUTN from Nanjing, China, demonstrate V2Sim&#8217;s capability to analyze the spatial-temporal distribution of EVCL and evaluate V2G impacts, such as fault dissemination and pricing variations, in unprecedented detail. Unlike traditional equilibrium models, V2Sim captures single-vehicle behavior and charging interactions at the microscopic level, offering unparalleled accuracy in assessing the operational and planning needs of V2G-compatible systems. This platform serves as a comprehensive tool for researchers and urban planners aiming to optimize integrated power and transportation networks.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Planning for Wireless Charging Lanes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10970087</link><description>The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is significantly hindered by the long charging time and range anxiety resulting from slow charging speed and limited battery capacity. Meanwhile, wireless charging lanes (WCLs) and solar-powered EVs (SEVs) offer a promising solution by providing wireless and solar charging power while driving. Under this circumstance, addressing the optimal planning of WCLs while considering SEV operations is crucial for facilitating the widespread adoption of EVs. Considering the uncertain solar power harvesting of SEVs, we propose a data-driven two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model for this integrated planning and operation problem. In the first stage, we optimize the deployment of WCLs with budget constraints, and the second stage determines the optimal operation schedules of SEVs under uncertain solar charging power characterized by a moment-based ambiguity set. To address the computational challenges (due to the discrete variables in both stages and the infinite-dimensional optimization in the second stage), we develop two approximation models and an integrated distributed method. Finally, extensive numerical experiments with synthetic and real transportation networks are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed models and algorithms. Specifically, the proposed DRO model achieves a 1.17% lower total cost in out-of-sample tests than the sample average approximation method, and with higher wireless charging power rates and increased battery capacities, we can build fewer WCLs.</description></item><item><title>A Real-Time Robust Method for Post-Disaster Load Restoration of Coordinated Power-Transportation System With Vehicle-to-Grid Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994444</link><description>With the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs), vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capability emerges as a potential resource for load restoration after a large disruption. This paper presents a real-time post-disaster load restoration method for the coordinated power distribution networks (PDN) and urban traffic networks (UTN) with V2G response. The multi-period restoration problem is modeled as a dynamic programming-based multi-stage robust optimization model, addressing uncertainties of renewable generation and traffic demands. It incorporates a dynamic traffic assignment scheme to characterize vehicle travels and V2G services within short time slots. Then, an improved robust dual dynamic programming algorithm is proposed to solve the multi-stage robust optimization problem. For online application, the solved value functions from each stage serve as per-period policies, leveraging knowledge of future uncertainties to quickly guide real-time load restoration through distributed resource dispatch, network reconfiguration, and V2G assignments. Numerical experiments with a 33-bus PDN and 20-road UTN, plus a real-world 91-bus PDN with 35-road UTN, validate the effectiveness of proposed restoration method.</description></item><item><title>Best Response Learning Assisted Asynchronous ADMM for Real-Time Energy Sharing Under Communication Delay</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981894</link><description>Energy sharing can activate prosumer flexibility to support power system operations. However, in practice, communication delays are inevitable and seriously threaten the real-time energy sharing equilibrium. While many asynchronous methods aim to address this, they ignore the learnability of prosumer&#8217;s response and often struggle to balance convergence speed and stability. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel asynchronous algorithm based on best response (BR) learning. First, we demonstrate that the prosumer&#8217;s best response in ADMM-based energy sharing can be represented as the piecewise linear function. Besides, we propose a batch-fitting method to learn the BR function with high accuracy and low computational cost. Building on this, we develop an asynchronous ADMM algorithm with a practical error criterion to ensure strict convergence of energy sharing under severe delays. Numerical studies indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve faster convergence with fewer iterations and greater reliability across various energy sharing scales and asynchronous rates than existing asynchronous algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Data Aggregation Reconfiguration Scheme to Mitigate Stealthy False Data Injection Attacks in Energy Management Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947360</link><description>Stealthy false data injection attacks (SFDIAs) pose serious threats to the stability and operation of power systems, with the potential to initiate cascading failures. These attacks depend on extensive access to system measurements, and the likelihood of gaining such access is closely linked to the structure of the system&#8217;s cyber-layer. However, the role of the cyber-layer in assessing SFDIA vulnerabilities has been largely overlooked in the literature, leading to oversimplified risk evaluations and suboptimal mitigation strategies. To address this gap, this paper first proposes a new cyber-physical risk metric (CPRM) to assess the system&#8217;s vulnerability to SFDIAs. The CPRM combines the physical impact of losing a transmission line-such as load shedding or generation loss-with the probability of such a loss resulting from an SFDIA. The likelihood of losing a transmission line is estimated by identifying all critical phasor measurement unit (PMU) sets, defined as sets whose measurements can be manipulated to stealthily overload the line. These critical PMU sets are determined using an algorithm that solves multiple bi-level optimization problems. Next, Bayesian attack graphs (BAGs) are developed for each substation and communication link to model potential access pathways and calculate the probability of compromising the identified critical PMU sets. Building on this analysis, the paper introduces a novel data aggregation reconfiguration (DAR) scheme that dynamically modifies the cyber-layer structure using software-defined networking (SDN) to minimize the risk of SFDIAs. Simulation results from the IEEE 39-bus test system demonstrate that the proposed DAR scheme significantly enhances the system&#8217;s resilience against SFDIAs.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Preservation for Cloud-Edge-Collaborative Energy Management System Using Post-Quantum Homomorphic Encryption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980370</link><description>Cloud-based energy management systems (EMS) in smart grids face privacy challenges, as existing methods based on traditional homomorphic encryption support limited operations and are vulnerable to quantum attacks.

Our approach enables both addition and multiplication operations on encrypted smart grid data while defending against quantum threats. We demonstrate the method&#8217;s security under the RLWE hardness assumption and validate its effectiveness through an experimental platform simulating smart grid environments. This work addresses computational limitations in current privacy-preserving techniques, enhancing data security for evolving smart grid technologies.</description></item><item><title>Node-Decomposition Privacy Preserving for Finite-Time Secondary Control of DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980358</link><description>In the distributed secondary control of DC microgrids, achieving both rapid convergence and robust information security is critical for enhancing control performance and maintaining power quality. However, current privacy-preserving approaches often compromise either control performance or privacy preservation performance. To address this challenge, this paper presents a node-decomposition privacy-preserving (NDPP) method for fully distributed, finite-time secondary control in DC microgrids. By splitting each node in the communication graph into multiple sub-nodes, the method enhances both convergence speed and privacy preservation without sacrificing control accuracy. Sub-nodes communicate within groups, and the topology of the generated graph is concealed from malicious nodes and eavesdroppers. Theoretical analysis is provided to prove finite-time voltage regulation and current sharing with privacy preservation against malicious nodes and external eavesdroppers. Simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the method in maintaining control performance and power quality.</description></item><item><title>Early-Stage Anomaly Detection in IT-OT Power Grid Communication Networks Using Wavelet Transform and Hybrid Deep Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988657</link><description>In cyber-physical power systems, the imperative convergence of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) engenders enhanced operational efficiency, yet increases susceptibility to cyberattacks. This scenario accentuates the necessity for deploying effective anomaly detection (AD) mechanisms to protect these critical infrastructures against the devastating impacts of cyberattacks. Traditional AD algorithms often focus on identifying anomalies through analyzing spatial and temporal patterns derived from the physical system measurements, an approach that typically proves effective only after a cyberattack has been successfully executed at the later stages of the cyberkill chain. This reactive approach fails to respond to evolving cyber threats. To tackle this issue, this article introduces an innovative framework for early-stage AD in integrated IT-OT power grid communication networks. Our approach models the IT-OT network as a traffic dispersion graph and applies wavelet transform to decompose the real-time traffic throughput of each information node into its constituent sub-bands to extract time-frequency features. These features are then weighted and prioritized using a graph attention mechanism and fed into a bidirectional long short-term memory for temporal analysis, ultimately classifying the nodes as normal or abnormal. Our experiments confirm the methodology&#8217;s precise detection and localization of active cyberattack sites, outperforming existing state-of-the-art AD models.</description></item><item><title>Observer-Based Finite-Time Fuzzy Load Frequency Control for Multiarea Nonlinear Power Systems Under Input Delays and Cyber Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993468</link><description>This paper presents an observer-based finite-time fuzzy load frequency control (LFC) strategy for multiarea nonlinear power systems with uncertain parameters, considering the impact of cyber attacks and input delays. To tackle the nonlinearities and uncertainties, an LFC model incorporating multiple input delays is developed within the interval type-2 (IT2) Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy framework. In response to unmeasurable states and unknown false data injection attacks (FDIAs), state and attack observers are designed to estimate these unknowns, thereby enabling effective compensation for FDIAs during the controller design. Furthermore, an observer-based reduction method is employed to transform the multiple input-delay system into a delay-free one, which reduces conservatism. Sufficient conditions are derived such that the closed-loop system is finite-time stable with  $H_{\infty }$  performance. Finally, simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A New Method for Stealthy False Data Injection Attack Detection Using Advanced Feasibility Areas Considering Spatial Distribution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11004030</link><description>The Feasibility Area (FA) in power system applications defines the region within which Power System State Variables (PSSVs) typically exist under normal operating conditions. Accurate characterization of the FA helps enhancing optimal power flow, detecting anomalies, and identifying stealthy False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs). Traditional FA-based approaches assess the location of PSSVs based on discrete time instances, using a binary flag to indicate whether the PSSVs lie inside or outside the FA. This paper introduces an advanced FA-based stealthy FDIAs detection method that improves upon this by incorporating the spatial distribution of PSSVs relative to the estimated FA. Unlike conventional methods, the advanced FA incorporates spatial distribution to evaluate the proximity of the current PSSV to the expected FA in the complex plane. A sigmoid-expansion flag is employed to represent the probability of the current PSSVs belonging to the expected FA, replacing the conventional binary flag. This sigmoid-expansion flag is then used as an input to a Deep Neural Network (DNN), where both the sigmoid-expansion flag and DNN model parameters are fine-tuned during training to ensure optimal compatibility, thereby improving detection accuracy. The proposed method significantly improves the detection of stealthy FDIAs, offering superior performance over traditional FA. Additionally, it enables the extraction of key attack characteristics, such as type, nature, and magnitude, further strengthening the system&#8217;s defense capabilities.</description></item><item><title>Carbon-Aware Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading in an Unbalanced Distribution Network via a Nash Equilibrium Discovery Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966432</link><description>Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading offers an innovative platform for prosumers to engage in bilateral electricity and carbon trades, enabling promoting the integration of distributed energy resources and supporting low-carbon operations in distribution networks. However, existing studies often rely on single-phase approximations, leading to inaccuracies in emission accounting and potential economic inefficiencies loss. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a carbon-aware P2P energy trading mechanism for unbalanced distribution networks. A novel joint electricity and carbon trading market framework is developed, integrating carbon permits trading with a continuous double auction mechanism. The trading process is formulated as a cooperative Markov game to capture the stochastic nature of market dynamics and to enable intelligent bidding decisions. A Nash equilibrium (NE) discovery multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework is employed, utilizing a trust region policy optimization-based algorithm to enhance trading reliability and policy interpretability. Simulations on a modified IEEE-123 unbalanced distribution network demonstrate the proposed effectiveness in reducing operational costs and carbon emissions, providing rigorous NE validation and showcasing its practical applicability in complex energy markets.</description></item><item><title>Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring via Binary Integer Search and Transient Load Feature Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10976991</link><description>Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) aims to analyze energy consumption and monitor loads without intrusive measurements. However, existing household NILM models often depend heavily on specific datasets or electricity usage scenarios, which limits their performance consistency across different households. To enhance adaptability across diverse households and regions, this paper proposes an optimization-based NILM solution consisting of two key steps: using binary integer search to determine a feasible solution space, and incorporating transient load features in the final solution selection. The proposed model only requires a few electrical parameters for each appliance, eliminating the need for device-level load training data. Tests on real-world datasets across multiple households demonstrate the model&#8217;s effectiveness in load disaggregation and its computational efficiency, making it suitable for practical applications. Furthermore, the model&#8217;s physical interpretability lays a strong foundation for further research and development.</description></item><item><title>RL2: Reinforce Large Language Model to Assist Safe Reinforcement Learning for Energy Management of Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016112</link><description>As large-scale distributed energy resources are integrated into the active distribution networks (ADNs), effective energy management in ADNs becomes increasingly prominent compared to traditional distribution networks. Although advanced reinforcement learning (RL) methods, which alleviate the burden of complicated modelling and optimization, have greatly improved the efficiency of energy management in ADNs, safety becomes a critical concern for RL applications in real-world problems. Since the design and adjustment of penalty functions, which correspond to operational safety constraints, require extensive domain knowledge in RL and power system operation, the emerging ADN operators call for a more flexible and customized approach to address the penalty functions so that the operational safety and efficiency can be further enhanced. Empowered with strong comprehension, reasoning, and in-context learning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide a promising way to assist safe RL for energy management in ADNs. In this paper, we introduce the LLM to comprehend operational safety requirements in ADNs and generate corresponding penalty functions. In addition, we propose an RL2 mechanism to refine the generated functions iteratively and adaptively through multi-round dialogues, in which the LLM agent adjusts the functions&#8217; pattern and parameters based on training and test performance of the downstream RL agent. The proposed method significantly reduces the intervention of the ADN operators. Comprehensive test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Distribution Network Expansion-Friendly Adaptive Deep Reinforcement Learning for Inverter-Based Volt-Var Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10975829</link><description>In recent years, in response to the challenges posed by the volatility and uncertainty of increasing renewable energy sources (RESs), numerous studies have emerged on inverter-based Volt-Var control (VVC) using data-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. However, most of these methods assume fixed distribution network (DN) scales, which may not be applicable under potential DN expansion involving newly connected nodes and controllable devices. To address this issue, this letter proposes a novel DRL framework for inverter-based VVC capable of adapting to evolving DN environments. Specifically, state embedding for expanding state space (SE-ESS) and action branching for expanding action space (AB-EAS) are designed to facilitate model fine-tuning for the expansion of DN scales. Case studies on a modified IEEE 33-bus system validate the proposed method&#8217;s strong adaptability to DN expansion.</description></item><item><title>Aggregated Modeling of Massive Heterogeneous Building HVAC Loads for Demand Response: A Fluid Dynamics Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988639</link><description>The aggregation of massive heterogeneous building HVAC (heating, ventilation and air-conditioning) loads is essential for enhancing the flexibility of power grids in demand response contexts. However, practical challenges such as unavailability of load parameters and sensor update delays significantly hinder the development of accurate aggregation models. To this end, this letter introduces a novel fluid dynamics perspective to model the HVAC aggregation behavior under more realistic scenarios that account for these practical issues. A novel analogy is established to treat the HVAC population as a fluid system, enabling the aggregation dynamics to be intuitively captured through well-established fluid phenomena. Building on this perspective, a 2-D advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equation-based aggregation model is developed. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately predict the aggregated power variation under these realistic scenarios. In addition, control strategies guided by this model can accurately track the reference load regulation signal, with an average relative error of less than 2%.</description></item><item><title>UAV Path Optimization Using High-Altitude Data and Mutated Fruit-Fly Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10932721</link><description>In uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation, one of the foremost challenges is devising efficient flight paths that navigate complex environments while conserving energy and avoiding obstacles. The paper proposes a High-Altitude Platform aided Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (HAPFOA) as a novel approach to address sub-optimal path planning in dynamic complex environments by leveraging fruit fly's innate foraging strategies and adapting them to the three-dimensional challenges of UAV navigation at high altitudes. This approach applies the Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (FOA), where each UAV is analogous to a &#8216;fly' exploring potential pathways. The paths chosen by these UAVs are evaluated using a comprehensive &#8217;smell' metric that integrates crucial navigational factors such as closeness to the target, obstacle avoidance, energy utilization, and maneuverability. This process is iterative, with each UAV continuously adjusting its flight path based on the &#8216;smell' metric feedback, aiming to find the route with the best possible &#8217;smell' score. The algorithm helps to avoid obstacles during the vision phase. Cubic spline interpolation is used to refine and smoothen the UAV trajectories to ensure the practical application of these flight paths, making them more applicable and realistic for risky operations. Based on obstacle warnings from HAPUAV, the simulation results show an efficient route formulation by the proposed model with no idle time and a faster convergence rate. Another advantage of HAPFOA is its ability to preserve more energy than other models.</description></item><item><title>Edge-Assisted Flexible Platooning of Connected and Automated Vehicles Under Traffic Anomaly</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10917005</link><description>The platooning of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) has the great potential to significantly improve travel experience in terms of safety, comfortableness, and energy efficiency. However, constrained by sensing range and prediction accuracy, the performance of CAV platoon can not be guaranteed in the scenario of mixed traffic consisting of CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs). This is not only due to the uncertainty of HDVs but also related to the occurrence of various traffic anomalies, such as emergency braking and accidents. In this paper, we aim to investigate an efficient control strategy to guarantee the operation of the platoon in mixed traffic, especially in the case of traffic anomalies. To tackle the problem, an edge-assisted platoon control strategy, called E-CACC, is proposed. First, an error-aware flexible tracking policy is designed to adapt to HDV uncertainties and speed prediction errors. Based on the tracking policy, a zone model predictive control (ZMPC) method is then designed to guarantee travel safety and avoid undesired acceleration. Further, a coordination strategy of CAV platoon and roadside unit (RSU) is proposed to prevent the platoon from potential collision in the case of traffic anomalies, where an event-based communication trigger is designed to determine whether and when the platoon establishes communication links with RSU to acquire exogenous sensing data of anomaly segment. Finally, the evaluation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving travel safety and comfortableness.</description></item><item><title>R-MDDQN: A V2V-Based Secure Computation Offloading Algorithm for Video Analytics in Vehicle Edge Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916985</link><description>Real-time analytics on video data requires substantial computational resources and high energy consumption, and computational offloading has emerged as a promising solution to support such resource-intensive services. However, most of the existing research fails to consider the collaboration between video quality and security optimization in wireless offloading, making it less efficient in real-world scenarios with diverse requirements. To address these challenges, we propose a novel V2V-based secure computation offloading algorithm for video analysis, called radial basis function (RBF)-based multi-objective double deep Q-network (R-MDDQN). We use Wyner's wiretap coding scheme to obtain the achievable secrecy capacity and ensure that video data cannot be decoded by eavesdroppers. To address the trade-off problem among multiple objectives, we employ an RBF weight network to dynamically adjust the weights by learning the variations of different objective values. Each DDQN agent receives reward evaluations based on different objective functions and effectively and dynamically approximates the optimal offloading strategy. Extensive experiments conducted using real-world datasets from Shenzhen demonstrate that the proposed R-MDDQN reduces latency by approximately 9.32$\%$, decreases energy consumption by around 7.3$\%$, improves video analysis accuracy by about 18.9$\%$, and enhances security capacity by roughly 14.8$\%$ compared to existing task offloading schemes.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Active-Passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted URLLC Services for Energy Efficiency Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912728</link><description>This paper investigates a hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) architecture incorporating both passive and active elements, to enhance the ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) services between a central controller (CC) and remote devices in mission-critical scenarios. Specifically, with the objective of maximizing the energy efficiency (EE) of the system under target reliability, an optimization problem in terms of the transmit precoding of CC, the reflecting coefficients of hybrid RIS, and the allocated blocklength is proposed. To deal with the intractability of the non-convex problem considering the various quality of service (QoS) issues of remote devices such as transmission latency and rate constraints, Dinkelbach's method is invoked to transform the original problem into a parameterized concave-convex function. Subsequently, efficient algorithms are developed based on alternating optimization, successive convex approximation, and Big-M formulation methods. In addition, the effects of several vital parameters on the performance of the proposed scheme are investigated. Numerical results show that compared to conventional full-passive/active RIS and no-RIS systems, the proposed hybrid RIS offers significant performance advantages. Furthermore, the optimal number and distribution of active/passive elements allocation are demonstrated. It is observed that the proposed hybrid RIS with only a few active elements can achieve higher EE than conventional passive RIS even with infinite blocklength, sufficiently revealing the potential of hybrid RIS to reduce transmission latency, guarantee rewarding reliability, and enhance EE for URLLC services.</description></item><item><title>A Glimpse of Physical Layer Security in Internet of Vehicles: Joint Design of the Transmission Power and Sensing Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10938968</link><description>The urgent need for higher sensing accuracy and transmission reliability in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), along with the limited availability of spectrum resources, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) tends to operate in higher frequency bands. This shift, however, introduces severe sensing-communication coupling interference. Due to the openness nature of the wireless medium, ISAC enabled IoV faces more significant security concerns. Centered at the communication interference, traditional physical layer security (PLS) schemes aim to maximize the channel quality difference between legitimate and eavesdropping channels to ensure the perfect secrecy. However, transforming directly current PLS methods into secure communication in ISAC-assisted IoV systems faces two significant challenges, because of sensing-communication coupling interference and strong directional beamforming caused by higher frequency bands. To address these challenges, this paper formulates an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the average secrecy rate by jointly designing the transmission power allocation and radar sensing power allocation, while ensuring the desired sensing accuracy and transmission reliability. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we introduce the block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to optimizing transmission power or radar sensing power individually, joint optimization significantly improves the average secrecy rate upon convergence, with increases of at least 265% and 441%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Performance Analysis and EE Optimization in AAV-Assisted Dual-Layer Heterogeneous Communication Network Based on RSMA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912793</link><description>This paper investigates a dual-layer heterogeneous communication network assisted by multiple autonomous aerial vehicles (AAVs) based on rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). Considering the repulsion characteristics between AAVs' positions and terrestrial base stations (BSs), AAVs are deployed in non-hole areas outside the BSs. The positions of AAVs are modeled by Poisson hole process (PHP). Due to the difficulty of directly solving the user association problem under PHP, the nearest neighbor hole approximation method is introduced. Due to the complex interference caused by multiple communication links in the dual-layer heterogeneous network, we adopt the conditional Laplace transform method to represent interference, deriving expressions for coverage probability and area spectral efficiency (ASE). Considering the energy constraints of the AAV network, this paper defines the system-level network energy efficiency (EE) as the ratio of the ASE to the average energy consumption per unit area. Utilizing this framework, we jointly optimize the AAV network density and the RSMA power allocation coefficients to maximize EE. The numerical results ultimately validated the accuracy of the theoretical analysis. Through simulation analysis, this paper explores the impact of network deployment parameters on system performance and provided the AAV network density and RSMA power allocation scheme that maximizes EE.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Geometry-Based Stochastic Model for Indoor Scenarios Incorporating Dense Multipath Components Towards Standardization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912741</link><description>Wireless channel measurements in both indoor office and industrial Internet of things (IIoT) scenarios reveal the presence of not only specular multipath components (SMCs) but also dense multipath components (DMCs). However, existing standard channel models including the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model lack the capability to characterize DMCs in these indoor scenarios. In this paper, an improved algorithm for estimating delay-angular parameters of DMC clusters is proposed for processing channel measurement data in indoor office and IIoT scenarios. Statistical properties of SMCs and measured DMCs are analyzed. Then, a novel time-domain non-stationary sixth generation (6G) standard channel model is proposed based on the extension of the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model by including DMCs for indoor scenarios. In the proposed 6G model, DMCs are incorporated by sharing the same cluster centers with SMCs but exhibiting different intra-cluster parameters, e.g., larger numbers of rays and larger values of intra-cluster delay spread. To accurately describe the cluster birth-death process, a squared sine function is introduced to model power changes of SMCs and DMCs with different rates. Moreover, simulation results of the proposed model are compared with those of the 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model, 6G pervasive channel model, and measurement data. The proposed model shows the closest agreement with measurement results.</description></item><item><title>Cooperative Sensing in Uplink ISAC System: A Multi-User Waveform Optimization Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912780</link><description>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is expected to become a crucial component of the sixth-generation (6G) networks owing to its outstanding spectrum management capability. However, improving the cooperative sensing capabilities of multiple ISAC user equipments (ISAC-UEs) in complex interference environment presents a significant research challenge. This paper focuses on the multi-user cooperative sensing in uplink orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) ISAC system. By utilizing the stochastic geometry, we model the distribution of communication UEs (COM-UEs) as a one-dimensional Matern hard-core point process (1-D MHCP), and derive a closed-form expression for interference power. To further enhance cooperative sensing accuracy while maintaining quality of service (QoS) in communication, we perform waveform optimization by jointly optimizing the weighted range-velocity Cramer&#8211;Rao lower bound (CRLB) subject to communication data rate (CDR) and subcarrier power ratio (SPR) constraints. This approach involves selecting the optimal subcarriers for sensing and allocating the corresponding power on each subcarrier for communication and sensing subsystems. By employing the convex relaxation and the cyclic minimization algorithm (CMA), we decompose the complex optimization problem into three sub-problems, simplifying the original NP-hard problem into a solvable one via a cyclic optimization framework. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of our optimization strategy, and evaluate the influence of CDR and SPR constraints using the CRLB and root mean square error (RMSE).</description></item><item><title>Delay-Aware Digital Twin Synchronization in Mobile Edge Networks With Semantic Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916988</link><description>The synchronization of digital twins (DT) serves as the cornerstone for effective operation of the DT framework. However, the limitations of channel capacity can greatly affect the data transmission efficiency of wireless communication. Unlike traditional communication methods, semantic communication transmits the intended meanings of physical objects instead of raw data, effectively saving bandwidth resource and reducing DT synchronization latency. Hence, we are committed to integrating semantic communication into the DT synchronization framework within the mobile edge computing system, aiming to enhance the DT synchronization efficiency of user devices (UDs). Our goal is to minimize the average DT synchronization latency of all UDs by jointly optimizing the synchronization strategy, transmission power of UDs, and computational resource allocation for both UDs and base station. The formulated problem involves sequential decision-making across multiple coherent time slots. Furthermore, the mobility of UDs introduces uncertainties into the decision-making process. To solve this challenging optimization problem efficiently, we propose a soft actor-critic-based deep reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize synchronization strategy and resource allocation. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can reduce synchronization latency by up to 13.2% and improve synchronization efficiency compared to other benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>Joint UAV Deployment, Power Allocation, and Coalition Formation for Physical Layer Security in Heterogeneous Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916952</link><description>In the coming sixth-generation era, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been explored for convenient air access and strong environmental adaptability to provide communication services for ground Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. However, the inherent broadcast nature of wireless makes UAV communications vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks. This paper explores a secure uplink communication in a heterogeneous network, where a UAV provides communication services to ground IoT nodes in the presence of an eavesdropper. We propose a transmission scheme to maximize the overall sum secrecy rate, in which the cooperative jamming technique and coalition formation game are employed, and the UAV endurance is considered. Specifically, a double-layer optimization problem is formulated, including a non-convex optimization problem in the lower layer, and a game theory problem in the upper layer. We use block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation methods to decompose the lower layer problem into UAV deployment and power allocation sub-problems, and convert them into a difference of two convex functions programming problem and a second-order cone programming problem, respectively. Moreover, we develop an algorithm to solve the upper layer problem, obtaining a stable coalition formation. Simulation results show that the proposed transmission scheme can effectively improve the overall sum secrecy rate, and has dynamic adaptability to eavesdropping attacks.</description></item><item><title>300 GHz Dual-Band Channel Measurement, Analysis and Modeling in L-Shaped Scenarios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10918843</link><description>The Terahertz (THz) band (0.1&#8211;10 THz) has been envisioned as one of the promising spectrum bands for sixth-generation (6 G) and beyond communications. In this paper, THz channel measurement, simulation, and modeling for the generalized L-shaped intersection scenario are conducted. First, a dual-band angular-resolvable wideband channel measurement in an L-shaped hallway is presented and THz channel characteristics at 306-321 GHz and 356-371 GHz are analyzed. Then, a generic L-shaped intersection scenario model is developed, by adapting the ray-tracing (RT)-statistical hybrid channel modeling method THz channel characteristics in the L-shaped scenario. Especially, the spatial consistency of reflected multi-path components (MPCs) in the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) region is analyzed, and the continuous change of dominant MPCs is statistically modeled, in terms of their power, delay and angles of arrival. As a result, the proposed hybrid approach reduces the computational cost by reducing the determination of dominant MPCs in the NLoS region of the L-shaped scenario. Besides, as conventional close-in and alpha-beta path loss models cannot take good care of large-scale fading in the NLoS case, a modified alpha-beta (M-AB) path loss model for the NLoS region of L-shaped scenarios is proposed and verified 80% more accurate for L-shaped scenarios at different frequency bands.</description></item><item><title>Outage-Aware Online Prediction Control for Securing UAV-Aided Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10919016</link><description>Considering an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided multi-user system with multiple mobile eavesdroppers, this paper aims to develop an outage-aware online control strategy to counter the imperfect information of mobile user equipments (UEs) and mobile eavesdroppers. To perform online control effectively, a novel online prediction model is proposed, which models the trajectory of UEs as a stochastic Gauss-Markov mobility model and the trajectory of eavesdroppers as a worst-case model based on the current imperfect location information. The online control problem is formulated as a new multi-stage optimization framework, in which we perform online control by solving per-slot prediction problems and a resource allocation problem for the initial point. In the per-slot prediction problem, we jointly optimize the predictive trajectory and transmit power for the upcoming time slot (TS) by maximizing the minimum achievable secrecy rate (ASR) among all UEs. For resource allocation at the initial TS, we optimize transmit power by maximizing the minimum ASR among all UEs. The per-slot prediction problem and the resourceallocation problem are all non-convex problems hence they are intractable in terms of computational complexity. To address them, we propose an efficient inner-approximation methods, by applying successive convex approximation (SCA) methodand S-procedure as well as Bernstein-type inequality. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed online control scheme over the conventional benchmark schemes which include existing offline schemes and online scheme without outage based prediction as well as shortest-path navigation scheme.</description></item><item><title>On Spectral Intelligence in 6G URLLC Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916508</link><description>Cognitive radio (CR)-empowered 6G networks are deemed a key candidate technology to achieve ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) with enhanced spectrum utilization efficiency. However, there are several challenges to address in achieving this objective. In particular, the sequential and random sensing performed by secondary users (SUs) to find idle channels within a given band in a CR network (CRN) leads to time and energy consumption, and processing overheads, which consequently cause early depletion of the device's energy, underutilization of the available spectrum, and prolonged delays in communication. To circumvent this problem, in this paper, a spectrum efficient scheme is proposed based on idle spectrum inference and ranking, which takes into account the devices' heterogeneity as well as their priorities in resource allocation. Based on the probabilistic approach, the scheme uses multiple parameters in a channel's evaluation and suitability assessment before selection for transmission. Markov chain modeling is leveraged to deal with the users' arrival and departure uncertainties and to derive expressions for core performance metrics, including service capacity and retainability, spectrum utilization efficiency, reliability, network unserviceable and handoff probabilities, channel availability, and communication latency. The scheme is analyzed under various patterns of users' arrivals. The acquired analytical and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared to the state-of-the-art to realize URLLC applications.</description></item><item><title>Joint Task Offloading and Resource Allocation for LEO Satellite-Based Mobile Edge Computing Systems With Heterogeneous Task Demands</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916814</link><description>To satisfy the growing demand for supporting intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) applications in remote areas, satellite mobile edge computing (SMEC) systems are expected to be widely deployed. Meanwhile, as IoT applications are increasingly diversified, the tasks received by SMEC systems present heterogeneous demands for various resources and quality of service (QoS) metrics, necessitating customized design to accommodate such heterogeneity. In this paper, we investigate the problem of joint task offloading and resource allocation in SMEC systems with heterogeneous task demands. We first propose a customized task utility model that captures the diversified demands, which is an extension of traditional unified task utility models. Based on the model, we then formulate a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem for joint optimization of task offloading, computing resource allocation, transmission power control, and user association, aiming to maximize the sum utility of all tasks. To solve the MINLP, a multi-layer iterative framework is proposed that decomposes the original problem into two subproblems, which are solved by successive convex approximation (SCA) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, respectively. Simulation results show that, by applying the proposed task utility model, the average utility performance of UEs can be improved by 50% and 100% compared to applying a single metric-based utility model and a typical classification-based utility model, respectively; the proposed task offloading and resource allocation scheme achieves a $30\%\hbox{--}80\%$ performance gain compared to benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic Optimization Framework for Computation Rate Maximization in UAV-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10918796</link><description>Mobile edge computing (MEC) significantly boosts the computing power and reduces the energy consumption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, serving as a valuable complement to cloud computing. The application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for MEC systems can effectively alleviate the issue of insufficient or damaged communication facilities in remote areas, further expanding the scope of MEC applications. In this article, we present a system model for UAV-assisted wireless-powered MEC systems in a dynamic environment with the objective of maximizing the computation rate of user devices. Due to the complexity of the optimization objective in dynamic environments, we propose a swarm intelligence-based optimization framework with a mechanism for responding to environmental changes, which is intended to enhance population diversity in both static and dynamic environments with the aim of overcoming premature convergence. We integrate particle swarm optimization and harmony search into the proposed framework, naming them DOPSO and DOHS, respectively. Simulation results for two offloading modes in UAV-assisted MEC systems indicate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms other dynamic optimization algorithms.</description></item><item><title>High-Speed Ultra-Energy-Efficient Memristor-Based Massive MIMO SIC Detector Circuit With Hybrid Analog-Digital Computing Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11017468</link><description>The emerging memristor crossbar array based computing circuits exhibit computing speeds and energy efficiency far surpassing those of traditional digital processors. This type of circuits can complete high-dimensional matrix operations in an extremely short time through analog computing, making it naturally applicable to linear detection and maximum likelihood detection in massive multiple-input&#8211;multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, the challenge of employing memristor crossbar arrays to efficiently implement other nonlinear detection algorithms, such as the successive interference cancellation (SIC) algorithm, remains unresolved. In this paper we propose a memristor-based circuit design for massive MIMO SIC detector. The proposed circuit comprises several judiciously designed analog matrix computing modules and hybrid analog-digital slicers, which enables the proposed circuit to perform the SIC algorithm with a hybrid analog-digital computing architecture. We show that the computing speed and the computational energy-efficiency of the proposed detector circuit are 43 times faster and 110 times higher, respectively, than those of a traditional 8-core digital signal processor (DSP), and also advantageous over the benchmark high-performance field programmable gate array (FPGA) and graphics processing unit (GPU).</description></item><item><title>A AAV-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Covert Communication System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945513</link><description>In this paper, an integrated sensing and covert communications (ISACC) framework is established for autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV) system, where one mobile AAV is deployed to provide sensing and communication services simultaneously, while there exists a malicious warden attempts to detect whether the AAV is communicating with multiple ground users during the whole flight. First, we consider that the communication signal from the AAV is hided under the cover of noise uncertainty in the presence of sensing signal. Then, to maximize the minimum achievable rate among all users with the required sensing performance and covertness, an efficient iterative solution is designed by jointly optimizing the power allocation, trajectory and communication scheduling of AAV. Numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of our proposed solution and demonstrate the fundamental trade-off between covertness, sensing requirement and communication achievable rate.</description></item><item><title>Target Detection for OTFS-Aided Cell-Free MIMO ISAC System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10922196</link><description>This paper focuses on enhancing target detection performance for a multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system using cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) waveform in high-speed vehicular environments. The former helps integrate sensing and communication technologies, whereas the latter enables delay-Doppler processing in which a doubly dispersive channel appears with almost constant and flat frequencies. We propose a sensing-centric (SC) approach for target detection using communication signals with/without sensing signals. Power allocation is optimized to maximize the sensing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the proposed SC scheme while ensuring a required quality-of-service (QoS) for the communication user equipment (UEs), and adhering to each access point's (AP's) power budget. Numerical results show that the proposed SC scheme vastly outperforms a communication-centric method that minimizes the total power consumed at the APs subject to the same constraints.</description></item><item><title>Channel Modeling and Rate Analysis of Optical Inter-Satellite Link (OISL)</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924779</link><description>Optical inter-satellite links (OISLs) improve connectivity between satellites in space. They offer advantages such as high-throughput data transfer and reduced size, weight, and power requirements compared to traditional radio frequency transmission. However, the channel model and communication performance for long-distance inter-satellite laser transmission still require in-depth study. In this paper, we first develop a channel model for OISL communication within non-terrestrial networks (NTN) by accounting for pointing errors caused by satellite jitter and tracking noise. We derive the distributions of the channel state arising from these pointing errors and calculate their average value. Additionally, we determine the average achievable data rate for OISL communication in NTN and design a cooperative OISL system, highlighting a trade-off between concentrating beam energy and balancing misalignment. We calculate the minimum number of satellites required in cooperative OISLs to achieve a targeted data transmission size while adhering to latency constraints. This involves exploring the balance between the increased data rate of each link and the cumulative latency across all links. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical model and provide insights into the optimal number of satellites needed for cooperative OISLs and the optimal laser frequency to use.</description></item><item><title>Diagnosis of PV Cell Antireflective Coating Degradation Resulting From Hot-Humid High-Voltage Potential Aging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966198</link><description>Corrosion of the antireflective coating on a photovoltaic cell (&#8220;${\text{AR}}_{\text{c}}$ corrosion&#8221;) has previously been observed in studies using hot-humid test conditions with external high-voltage (HV) bias. This study primarily focuses on known vulnerable legacy aluminum back surface field cells in mini-modules (MiMos) put through comparative stepped stress tests. Each cell type had MiMos at +1500 V, &#8211;1500 V, or unbiased (&#8220;$V_{\text{oc}}$&#8221;) potential, which were sequentially subjected to test conditions of 60 &#176;C/60% relative humidity (RH) for 96 h, as in International Electrotechnical Commission Technical Specification 62804-1; 70 &#176;C/70% RH for 200 h; and 85 &#176;C/85% RH for 200 h. Characterizations at each step included visual camera and electroluminescence (EL) imaging, colorimetry, and current&#8211;voltage curve tracing. Final characterizations included: Suns&#8211;$V_{\text{oc}}$, spatial mapping of external quantum efficiency, high-resolution photoluminescence, EL, and dark lock-in thermography imaging. Forensics were performed on extracted cores, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning Auger microscopy (SAM). Forensics were also conducted on MiMos from previous studies that underwent stepped HV aging and separate outdoor aged full-sized modules. ${\text{AR}}_{\text{c}}$ corrosion was specifically seen for the glass/encapsulant/cell side of the +1500 V (HV+) stressed MiMos and modules. Appearance, color, and reflectance were the most distinguishing characteristics relative to glass corrosion, gridline corrosion and delamination, and other concurrent degradation modes. SEM/EDS and SAM identified the conversion of silicon nitride to hydrated silica, hydrous silica, or hydrated amorphous silica, which preferentially occurred at the edges and tips of the pyramidal textured cell surface.</description></item><item><title>CsGeI3 Perovskite-Based Solar Cells for Higher Efficiency and Stability: An Experimental Investigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988679</link><description>Among the recent developments in photovoltaic technologies, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn significant attention, owing to their exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE), cost-effectiveness, and better optoelectronic characteristics. However, the stability and presence of lead (toxicity) in PSCs remains a major challenge to their commercialization. In this study, we experimentally investigated all-inorganic, lead-free CsGeI3-based PSCs in an n-i-p configuration. The CsGeI3 films were synthesized using a one-step spin-coating technique and their crystallographic characteristics were analyzed. Furthermore, we fabricated and tested different device architectures incorporating CsGeI3 as the absorber layer with various electron transport layers (ETLs), including TiO2, ZnO, and graphene oxide (GO), while employing MoS2 as the hole transport layer. The resulting device structure was Fluorine doped Tin oxide (FTO)/(TiO2/ZnO/GO)/CsGeI3/MoS2/Ni). All fabricated devices demonstrated excellent performance, with the TiO2-based ETL device achieving the highest PCE of 10.79%. In addition, incorporating reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as an interface layer on top of the absorber layer further enhanced photovoltaic performance by approximately 3% across all configurations (achieving outstanding efficiency of 13.57%). The hydrophobic nature and high conductivity of rGO suggest its potential as a promising strategy for improving the stability and efficiency of lead-free PSCs in future applications.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Photovoltaic Module Characterization: Using Image Transformers for Current&#8211;Voltage Curve Prediction From Electroluminescence Images</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002587</link><description>Individual photovoltaic (PV) module health monitoring can be a daunting task for operation and maintenance of solar farms. Modules can be inspected through luminescence, thermal imaging, and current&#8211;voltage (I&#8211;V) curve analyzes for identification of damage and power loss. I&#8211;V curves provide easily interpretable data to determine module health as they directly provide electrical performance metrics. However, in order to obtain these curves, modules must be disconnected from the array and either removed to a solar simulator or characterized in situ with corrections for module temperature, the incident solar spectrum, and intensity. Luminescence or thermal images of a module are relatively easy to acquire in situ. Electroluminescence (EL) images highlight physical defects in the modules but do not provide easily interpretable features to correlate with electrical performance. This work presents a SWin transformer network to predict I&#8211;V curves for PV modules from their corresponding EL images. The predicted I&#8211;V curves allow the accurate prediction of the maximum power point (MPP), short-circuit current $I_{\text {sc}}$, and open-circuit voltage $V_{\text {oc}}$ with a mean error less of than 1%. Comparing single diode model (SDM) parameters extracted from the predicted curves to those extracted from the true curves, the series resistance $R_{\text {s}}$ demonstrates a mean error of 5.19%, and the photocurrent $I$ a mean error of 0.197%. The shunt resistance $R_{\text {sh}}$ and dark current $I_{\text {o}}$ parameters are predicted with larger errors because of their sensitivity to small changes in the I&#8211;V curve.</description></item><item><title>Probability Mass Function of Energy for Light-Collecting Surfaces in Rough Geometries and Its Applications in Urban Energy and Photovoltaics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10971967</link><description>Sunlight throughout urban areas largely impacts local climate [sustainable development goal (SDG) 13], residents&#8217; well-being (SDG 3), and access to clean energy (SDG 7). However, sunlight availability on various urban surfaces is affected by urban geometry. Here, in this work, a probabilistic framework to evaluate the interplay between sunlight and urban geometry is presented, and its immediate applications in urban energy studies are demonstrated. A probability mass function that predicts the energy production of a group of light-collecting surfaces, such as solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, installed in rough geometries, such as urban areas, is derived. Along the way, an expression for the sky view factor (SVF) is formulated within rough geometries as well as a link between the capacity factor of the residential PV fleet and urban geometry. The predictions of the mathematical framework are validated using the digital surface model and collected PV systems data in The Netherlands. This work primarily helps understand the underlying relation between the geometrical parameters of a rough surface and the received sunlight energy on a subset of that surface. Exemplified applications are swift SVF calculations and residential PV fleet yield predictions, which, respectively, support efficient urban energy assessments and privacy-preserving electrical grid management.</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning-Based Health Monitoring for Photovoltaic Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993290</link><description>The transition to renewable energy sources like photovoltaic (PV) systems is essential for societal progress, counteracting the adverse effects of fossil fuels. However, managing PV systems entails significant challenges and economic implications. PV fault occurrence necessitates swift detection and resolution, exacerbating financial burdens. Effective fault diagnosis relies heavily on data from PV plant monitoring and energy management systems. Historically, PV monitoring relied on manual inspections, but autonomous aerial vehicle (UAV) technology provides a more efficient and comprehensive solution, enhancing safety and offering detailed imagery, scalability, environmental monitoring, and advanced data analytics. This study utilizes deep learning (DL) approaches to monitor the health of the PV, focusing on analyzing UAV-captured scenes. Specifically, this article presents an end-to-end two-stage DL-based health monitoring framework that consists of semantic segmentation model, SegFormer, for isolating solar panels and object detection model, YOLOv8, for identifying anomalies within the PV modules. The proposed framework is validated and compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on a three publicly available UAV-captured datasets.

We find that a global optimization approach to backtracking results in climate-specific annual energy gains of 2.4%&#8211;3.2% relative to a traditional backtracking algorithm baseline. We identify a strong logarithmic correlation between local diffuse fraction and yield improvement, and highlight the effect of seasonal precipitation on performance gains. We also find that a backtracking approach, which approximates the terrain as constant, does not offer significant annual energy gains over the baseline on the synthetic terrain. Our findings suggest that specific yield from backtracking in the USA can be improved by as much as 88 kWh/kW by considering terrain when selecting a backtracking algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Vertical Bifacial Photovoltaic System Model Validation: Study With Field Data, Various Orientations, and Latitudes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10985871</link><description>Accurate modeling of photovoltaic (PV) systems is critical for the design, financial analysis, and monitoring of solar PV plants. For bifacial PV applications, models must additionally offer robust rear-side irradiance algorithms. However, bifacial PV irradiance models have yet to be sufficiently validated for east&#8211;west vertically oriented systems, where direct beam solar irradiation swaps at solar noon. Here, we validate five bifacial irradiance models with field data collected in Golden, CO, USA (40&#176;N) and Fairbanks, AK, USA (65&#176;N) for east&#8211;west vertical, north&#8211;south vertical, and south-tilted arrays. There is no clear best performer among subhourly models; Bifacial_radiance, bifacialVF, the System Advisor Model, and dual-sided energy tracer (DUET) comparably predict seasonal and daily changes in PV production, with root-mean-squared error (RMSE) falling in the range of 11&#8211;28% depending on the location and system orientation. PVSyst (v7.4.8), limited by hourly resolution, demonstrates RMSE in the range of 33&#8211;45%. The primary causes of high RMSE are similar for all models; using an irradiance cutoff of &gt;100 W/m2, using clear-sky filtering, and removing time stamps with snow, lowers model RMSE to 4&#8211;13% for subhourly models and 12&#8211;25% for PVSyst. Regular meteorological station servicing is found to further decrease model RMSE by up to 3% abs. in Alaska. Finally, we model bifacial PV systems in over 250 locations between 15 and 85&#176;N, finding that deviations between model-predicted annual insolation tend to be 2&#8211;3&#215; higher for vertical PV systems than south-facing fixed-tilt systems. We discuss potential methods for improving vertical PV modeling and provide recommendations for high-quality field data collection in northern environments.</description></item><item><title>Sustainability Impact of Different PV Mounting Systems and Pathways for Decarbonizing Emissions of PV Deployment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11007072</link><description>The amount of electricity generated by a solar panel varies according to the installation location and chosen mounting structure. This changes the effective material consumption and the associated effective carbon emissions of electricity produced by each solar panel. This article investigates the impact of different photovoltaic (PV) mounting systems on energy yield, material consumption, and carbon emissions, focusing on the key configurations of fixed-tilt (FT), east&#8211;west, and single-axis tracking systems. As global PV capacity rapidly expands, understanding the sustainability of these systems is crucial for decarbonizing the electricity sector. We highlight the impact of different mounting systems on yield at different latitudes and demonstrate that the effective material consumption can vary by over 30% in terms of both g/Wp and g/kWh, along with the impact on carbon emissions in terms of both gCO2-eq/Wp and gCO2-eq/kWh. Pathways to reduce the carbon footprint in gCO2-eq/kWh by up to 60% compared with the FT baseline case are also discussed, including incorporating green steel and decarbonized concrete.</description></item><item><title>A Design Methodology for Thermal Monitoring of Reusable Passive Interposers With RTDs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008706</link><description>The heterogeneous integration underpinned by several advanced packaging options, such as passive interposers offers a promising direction for future integrated systems. However, the diversity of chiplets integrated in these systems can increase design complexity. A means to mitigate this situation is to reuse interposer fabrics. Consequently, reusable interposers should provide for signaling, power, and thermal issues. This work emphasizes thermal issues by introducing a novel and sufficiently accurate thermal monitoring strategy suitable for reusable passive interposers. The proposed strategy is based on metal resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) as sensors optimally arranged on a fixed rectangular grid supporting the reuse of passive interposers. A step-by-step methodology provides the design and allocation of the sensors across the interposer fabric under temperature precision and area constraints. Diverse benchmark scenarios are investigated with the proposed RTDs, which consume only  $33.6~\mu \text {W}$  with a footprint of only  $0.159~\text {mm}^{2}$ . Simulation results show that the proposed methodology achieves six times ( $6\times $ ) improvement in mean absolute error (MAE) for reconstructed heatmaps over conventional chiplet-based sensors. This improvement is shown for different chiplet placements onto an interposer and for 2.5-D heterogeneous systems, where the integrated components do not include any or sufficient on-chip thermal sensors to provide the required temperature precision.</description></item><item><title>A 14-bit 6.7 MS/s 0.018 mm2 98 &#956;W SAR A/D Converter With On-the-Fly Autocalibration for Array Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002748</link><description>A 14-bit, 6.7 MS/s successive-approximation-register (SAR) A/D converter (ADC) is presented with on-chip autocalibration.

Existing SpMSpM accelerators based on inner product (IP) and outer product (OP) suffer from low computational efficiency and high memory traffic due to inefficient index matching and merging overheads. Gustavson&#8217;s product (GP)-based accelerators mitigate some of these challenges but struggle with workload imbalance and irregular memory access patterns, limiting computational parallelism. To overcome these limitations, we propose a distribute-merge product (DMP), a novel SpMSpM dataflow that evenly distributes workloads across multiple computation streams and merges partial results efficiently. We design and implement DMP-based SpMSpM architecture (DMSA), incorporating four key techniques to fully exploit the parallelism of DMP and efficiently handle irregular memory accesses. Implemented on a Xilinx ZCU106 FPGA, DMSA achieves speedups of up to  $3.38\times $  and  $1.73\times $  over two state-of-the-art FPGA-based SpMSpM accelerators while maintaining comparable hardware resource usage. In addition, compared to CPU and GPU implementations on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, DMSA is  $4.96\times $  and  $1.53\times $  faster while achieving  $6.67\times $  and  $2.33\times $  better energy efficiency, respectively.</description></item><item><title>An 197-&#956;J/Frame Single-Frame Bundle Adjustment Hardware Accelerator for Mobile Visual Odometry</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10973288</link><description>This article presents an energy-efficient hardware accelerator for optimized bundle adjustment (BA) for mobile high-frame-rate visual odometry (VO). BA uses graph optimization techniques to optimize poses and landmarks and the applications are robot navigation, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR).

However, the computational intensity and resource requirements are significant challenges to apply to accelerators. In this article, we propose the scalable, spiking self-supervised learning, streamline optimization accelerator ( $S^{3}$ A)-neural processing unit (NPU), a highly optimized accelerator for spiking SSL models. This architecture minimizes memory access by leveraging input data provided by the user and optimizes computation through the maximization of data reuse. By dynamically optimizing memory based on model characteristics and implementing specialized operations for data preprocessing, which are critical in SSL, computational efficiency can be significantly improved. The parallel processing lanes account for the two encoders in the SSL architecture, combined with a pipelined structure that considers the temporal data accumulation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to enhance computational efficiency. We evaluate the design on field-programmable gate array (FPGA), where a 16-bit quantized spiking residual network (ResNet) model trained on the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) and MNIST dataset has top 94.08% accuracy.  $S^{3}$ A-NPU optimization significantly improved computational resource utilization, resulting in a 25% reduction in latency. Moreover, as the first spiking self-supervised accelerator, it demonstrated highly efficient computation compared to existing accelerators, utilizing only 29k look up tables (LUTs) and eight block random access memories (BRAMs). This makes it highly suitable for resource-constrained applications, particularly in the context of spiking SSL models on edge devices.

To alleviate the data conversion and transmission overheads in CMOS image sensor (CIS), processing-in-sensor (PIS) has been proposed, enabling computations to occur directly within sensory systems. Meanwhile, brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) emerges as a promising computing paradigm well-suited for PIS due to its high accuracy and efficiency in various cognitive tasks. However, HDC requires transforming the sensed signals into long hypervectors (HVs), which imposes significant overhead for PIS systems. Thus, in this article, we propose SenHDC, a hardware-software co-design framework for HDC-based PIS. We introduce a novel hardware-friendly encoding paradigm that eliminates complex HV transformations, coupled with a noise-resilient position HV generation method that mitigates the impact of capacitance load imbalance. We further present an efficient 3-D NAND flash-based compute-in-memory (CIM) hardware design, comprising an encoding module that performs encoding in charge domain and an associative search module that checks the similarity between the input and prestored classes for classification. Experimental results show that SenHDC improves energy efficiency by  $40.6\times $  and  $1.6\times $  in the encoding module and associative search module, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art HDC CIM implementations.</description></item><item><title>3-D Digital Compute-in-Memory Benchmark With A5 CFET Technology: An Extension to Lookup-Table-Based Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008711</link><description>Digital compute-in-memory (DCIM) has emerged as a promising solution to address scalability and accuracy challenges in analog compute-in-memory (ACIM) for next-generation AI hardware acceleration.

A novel A5 CFET-based 8T DCIM bit cell (6T SRAM +2T AND gate) is proposed to improve total footprint and latency over the conventional 10T DCIM bit cell, and its functionality is verified through technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation. For macro- and system-level evaluation of the proposed 3-D DCIM architectures, an extended NeuroSim V1.4 framework is developed, the first compute-in-memory (CIM) benchmark framework enabling CIM simulation at the A5 CFET technology node.

The proposed architecture not only supports system-level reconfiguration but also enables transistor-level programmability. The FPAA is comprised of a  $3\times 4$  configurable analog block (CAB) array, with a single configurable logic block (CLB) added to each column to allow for the programming of digital circuits. Passive devices, including programmable capacitors and resistors, and active transistor pairs (TPs), are utilized to implement both continuous-time and discrete-time circuits. A placement algorithm is developed that efficiently maps analog circuits onto the FPAA fabric by finding the optimal vertical and horizontal locations for the assignment of transistors. In addition, to reduce the complexity of placing devices on the fabric, a technique is developed that matches TPs in the same vertical level to predefined topologies in a library. Routers are included to connect devices implemented on the FPAA fabric. The proposed FPAA occupies an area of 4 mm2 in a TSMC 65-nm fabrication process. The smaller circuits implemented on the FPAA fabric include a folded-cascode amplifier, a strongArm comparator, a continuous-time integrator, and a switch-capacitor integrator. The larger analog and mixed-signal circuits implemented on the FPAA fabric include a four-stage pipeline analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a first-order delta-sigma modulator.

There are already available countermeasure methods currently used for protecting cryptographic implementations that can be tailored to protect embedded NN models. Shuffling, a hiding-based countermeasure that randomly shuffles the order of computations, was shown to be vulnerable to SCA when the Fisher-Yates algorithm is used. In this article, we propose a design of an SCA-secure version of the Fisher-Yates algorithm. By integrating the masking technique for modular reduction and Blakely&#8217;s method for modular multiplication, we effectively remove the vulnerability in the division operation that led to side-channel leakage in the original version of the algorithm. We experimentally evaluate that the countermeasure is effective against SCA by implementing a correlation power analysis (CPA) attack on an embedded NN model implemented on ARM Cortex-M4. Compared to the original proposal, the memory overhead is  $2\times $  the biggest layer of the network, while the time overhead varies from 4% to 0.49% for a layer with 100 and 1000 neurons, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Partial Recomputation-Based Fault Detection Approaches for Z-transform</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981316</link><description>The Z-transform is a fundamental and strong tool being widely utilized in signal processing and various other applications such as communications and networking. By analyzing the Z-transform of a signal, one can extract critical information about its stability, causality, frequency response, energy and power, and overall behavior of the signal. However, errors caused either by environmental changes or malicious injections in large-scale integration (VLSI) implementations can critically compromise the integrity and reliability of its output. Failure to detect such faults may result in unpredictable, erroneous, and misleading function analyses. Therefore, the ability to detect soft errors and faults before accepting the results is of paramount importance. In this article, we propose an efficient fault detection method that combines algorithmic-level checks with partial recomputation to identify both transient and permanent faults with a high error coverage rate across various injection scenarios. The AMD/Xilinx field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of our design demonstrated only a modest increase in time and area overhead.

PPFDs have high harmonic rejection, but suffer from limited power efficiency and conversion gain, mainly due to second-harmonic feedback. Conventional harmonic reflectors (HRs) minimize this undesired feedback introducing a common-mode second-harmonic resonance, at the price of increased area and reduced bandwidth. In the proposed design, the HR is embedded into a transformer-based input-matching network to decouple the differential-mode inductance from the common-mode inductance. This results in a more compact design, with higher output power and improved power efficiency. A common-gate transistor is stacked with the push-push pair to further boost the output power while reusing the same current. Two PPFDs are cascaded without additional power amplification stages. The quadrupler, implemented in 28-nm CMOS, achieves a peak output power of 0 dBm and peak power efficiency of 5% at 77 GHz and the 3-dB bandwidth is from 70 to 86 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A 94.7-dB Dynamic Range Fully Passive Switched-Capacitor Low-Pass Filter With Enhanced Selectivity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884547</link><description>In this article, a passive gain-boosting technique is employed to improve the bandpass gain, input-referred noise, and area usage of a charge-rotation switched-capacitor (CRSC) filter. In addition, a passive feedback network is introduced, creating a sharp transition between the passband and stopband, thereby enhancing noise and linearity performance compared to prior work employing active feedback. Furthermore, the utilization of the pipeline technique raises the sampling frequency to match the clock frequency. The proposed filter is fabricated in 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS technology. Operating from 1.8 V, the measured power dissipation of the filter is 1.52 mW. By applying a 250-MHz clock, the cutoff frequency of the filter can be tuned from 428 kHz to 6.75 MHz, while the dc gain is fixed at 1.33 dB under different bandwidth settings. For a 3-dB cutoff frequency of 2.35 MHz, the measured in-band IIP3 and IIP2 are 25 and 56 dBm, while the out-of-band IIP3 and IIP2 are 22.4 and 71.4 dBm, respectively. The input-referred integrated noise over 110 kHz&#8211;2.35 MHz is  $8.58{\mu }$ Vrms.

The proposed low-power global clock distribution not only significantly reduces power consumption across multi-lane RXs but is capable of compensating for the frequency offset without any phase interpolators (PIs). To this end, a fractional divider (FDIV) controlled by CDR is placed close to the global phase locked loop. Moreover, in order to address the suboptimal lock point of conventional baud-rate phase detectors, the proposed CDR employs a background eye-climbing algorithm (ECA), which optimizes the sampling phase and maximizes the vertical eye margin (VEM). Fabricated in a 28 nm CMOS process, the proposed  $4 \times 32$  Gb/s RX shows a low integrated fractional spur of &#8722;40.4 dBc at a 2500 ppm frequency offset.

The low-noise front end utilizes a capacitor assisting triple-winding transformer (CTTF) to expand bandwidth and suppress noise. An injection-locked oscillator driven by a delay-locked loop is used to generate the quadrature clocks without using the divider and the associated high-frequency clock. The hybrid baseband filter consisting of passive RLC and active-RC biquad simultaneously achieves high linearity and flexible gain/bandwidth adjustments. The analog baseband circuitry employs a feedforward compensated transconductance amplifier that greatly relaxes the power-bandwidth trade-off. To mitigate the impact of complex and frequency-dependent quadrature error (I&#8211;Q mismatch) arising from I-to-Q clock overlap, the receiver applies separate RF- $G_{m}$  to drive I and Q passive mixers. Fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, the proposed receiver exhibits a noise figure of 2.1&#8211;5.4-dB and 30&#8211;72-dB adjustable conversion gain, &gt;20-dBm in-band OIP3, &gt;16-dBm out-of-band OIP3 with a total power consumption of 104&#8211;199-mW at 1-V supply.</description></item><item><title>A Six-Phase Harmonic-Rejection Digital Transmitter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10808172</link><description>This article presents a six-phase cell-reused digital transmitter (DTX) using 1/3 duty-cycle local oscillator (LO) signals for harmonic rejection. The 1/3 duty-cycle square wave ideally generates no 3rd-order component, thus facilitating the on-chip method to improve 3rd-order harmonic rejection (HR3). The six-phase architecture is realized with cell-reused technique and Doherty load modulation to produce higher output power and 18 efficiency peaks on the complex plane. Switch-off resistance control is implemented in the digital power amplifier (DPA) to optimize its linearity. A multi-phase injection-locking (MPIL)-based multi-phase LO generator (MPLG) is introduced for accurate and low-noise LO generation. Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS technology with a compact core size of 0.86 mm2, this DTX realizes 28.3- and 27.7-dBm peak output power with 41.0% and 28.5% peak system efficiency (SE) at 0.9 and 1.7 GHz, respectively.

The baud-rate CDR reduces the burden of multi-phase clock generation and distribution, thus reducing the power consumption of clocking circuits. A pattern-based phase detector (PBPD) is proposed in the clock recovery path to address the transition density (TD) reduction caused by the baud-rate operation. The PBPD optimizes patterns that provide phase information, increasing TD by  $4{\times }$  compared with the conventional baud-rate PD, Mueller-M&#252;ller phase detector (MMPD). In addition, the number of comparators required for data recovery is reduced by one per unit interval (UI) by sharing the comparators used for CDR. The CDR prototype fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS is verified using PRBS31 pattern, where a bit error ratio less than 3e-8 is achieved under 5.6-dB channel loss at 0.83-pJ/b energy efficiency while occupying only 0.011 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 78.2-dB Dynamic Range Shunt-Based Current Sensor for BLDC Motor Control With 2.75-&#956;s Conversion Time and 0.4-mm&#178; Active Area</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10792655</link><description>This article presents a shunt-based current sensor (CS) designed for brushless dc (BLDC) motor control. The proposed sensing system digitizes the current flowing through an external 12-m $\Omega $  resistor by sampling the resulting voltage drop by means of an accumulation-based sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit followed by a SAR-assisted  $\Sigma \Delta $  incremental analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The employment of an accumulation technique within the S/H circuit allows to amplify the input signal while effectively mitigating the  $kT/C$  noise contribution, leading to a significant improvement to the dynamic range (DR) of the readout. The proposed ADC architecture, on the other hand, allows achieving the target resolution in a relatively fast conversion time, essential feature needed to meet the stringent latency requirement imposed by the considered application. The sensor was fabricated in a standard 130-nm CMOS process, occupies a silicon area of 0.4 mm2, and draws 6.7 mA from a 1.5-V supply. Over a &#177;4-A input current range and a  $- 20~^{\circ }$ C to  $100~^{\circ }$ C temperature range, it achieves a worst case gain error of &#177;0.8%.

However, FP-CIM with FP32/FP16/BF16 data format incurs a performance bottleneck due to the large storage requirements and MAC power. The emerging POSIT data format exploits dynamic bit width that adapts to varied data distributions, enabling using a low-bit-width to reach nearly the same accuracy performance as conventional high-bit-width FP (POSIT $8~{\approx }$  FP16/BF16). Therefore, a POSIT-based CIM exhibits inherent advantages over the traditional FP-CIM. Despite the theoretical superiority, the dynamic property of POSIT introduces huge exponent processing overhead, cell underutilization of the CIM array, and redundant logic toggles in mantissa addition for POSIT-base CIM. This article presents a POSIT-based digital CIM (PD-CIM) macro with three features to tackle the above challenges: 1) a bi-directional regime processing unit (BRPU) simplifies the complicated codec logic to reduce the energy overhead in dynamic exponent processing; 2) a critical-bit pre-compute-and-store (CPCS) CIM utilizes the spare CIM cells caused by the dynamic bit-width of mantissa to improve cell utilization of the CIM array; and 3) a cyclically alternating computing-scheduling unit replaces the bit-wise addition of dynamically aligned mantissas with bit-wise OR to save logic toggles power. Fabricated in a 28 nm CMOS technology, PD-CIM occupies an area of 1.41 mm2. It reaches an 83.23 TFLOPS/W peak energy efficiency at POSIT(8,1) for ImageNet classification on the vision transformer base (ViT-B) model.

This  $\Delta \Sigma $  CIM processor effectively mitigates redundant operations associated with unchanged input features and adaptively adjusts computing-in-memory (CIM) outputs to achieve a near-zero-mean (NZM) distribution, thereby benefiting the energy-intensive analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The proposed  $\Delta \Sigma $  CIM macro involves three main innovations at the architecture and circuit levels: first, it replaces absolute inputs with deltas computed from consecutive input values, resulting in a notable 35.8% reduction in energy consumption for the CIM array; second, the delta matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) implemented by  $\Delta \Sigma $  CIM array can self-adaptively shift the analog CIM outputs to be NZM distributed, facilitating streamlined centralized data processing; and third, the introduction of a least significant bit first (LSB-first) ADC, whose number of conversions adjust dynamically based on instantaneous input values, allows for efficient analog output conversion of highly concentrated NZM analog data without compromising full-scale range or precision. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) analog SRAM-based CIM macros, this work achieves superior area-energy efficiency product by  $1.25{\times }$  with up to 21.38 TOPS/W and 1.44 TOPS/mm2 at full precision of 8b input, 8b weight, and 24b output, through bit-serial inputs and shifter-and-adder.</description></item><item><title>An 800-MHz 8.17-TOPS/W 0.63-TOPS/mm2 Memory-Utilization-Aware CNN Accelerator Featuring a Memory Stationary Dataflow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10873361</link><description>Increasing the on-chip memory utilization (OCMU) is crucial for an area-efficient deep neural network accelerator. We propose a memory stationary (MS) dataflow to ingeniously combine the input and output features in a single memory block in a cyclic manner, significantly increasing the OCMU. The MS dataflow also reduces the feature memory access by 78.0%. Furthermore, residual paths in a ResNet model require large feature buffering. We introduce layer-wise clipped-asymmetric residual distillation (LCARD) quantization, removing the residual paths with minimal accuracy degradation. It dynamically assigns different feature/weight bit-widths for different layers, further enhancing the OCMU by  $3.2{\times }$  and throughput by  $4.5{\times }$  from a fixed bit-width (FBW) approach. We also present an MS gating (MSG) to skip the ineffective channels that improve the OCMU by  $1.2{\times }$  and throughput by  $1.3{\times }$ . Fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, the proposed accelerator exhibits an 8.17-TOPS/W peak energy efficiency and a 0.63-TOPS/mm2 peak area efficiency at 800 MHz and 0.9 V while requiring only a 120 kB on-chip static random-access memory (SRAM) for the ResNet-50.</description></item><item><title>A 0.5-V 125-MHz 256-Kb 22-nm SRAM With 10-aJ/bit Active Energy and 10-pW/bit Shutdown Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10820858</link><description>Conventional low-voltage (LV) static random access memories (SRAMs) utilizing separate read-and-write assist circuits sacrifice access speed too much, leading to poor energy efficiency. Overlaying additional assist circuits to enable power-saving modes can exacerbate speed loss and energy inefficiency. This work proposes a coordinated read-write-hold-retention-shutdown (SD) assist circuit design for SRAMs to improve speed at low VDD and reduce leakage current in active and power-saving modes. This leads to overall power reduction and enhanced energy efficiency. The implemented 22-nm 256-Kb SRAM can operate down to 0.45 V, with the minimum energy point at 0.5 V. At 0.5 V, TT corner, and  $25~{^{\circ }}$ C, the measured maximum frequency ( $f_{\max }$ ) is 125 MHz with a 10 aJ/bit active energy, representing a 6.25 higher frequency with a 91% energy reduction, compared to the state-of-the-art 0.5-V SRAM in 28-nm bulk CMOS. The SRAM has a 12 pW/bit deep-sleep power and a 10 pW/bit SD power at 0.5 V.</description></item><item><title>A 28-nm Software-Defined Accelerator Chip With Circuit-Pipeline Scaling and Intrinsic Physical Unclonable Function Enabling Secure Configuration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856925</link><description>As emerging applications raise ever-boosting and varying computational demand, the reconfigurable accelerator is becoming prevalent due to balanced performance, efficiency, and flexibility. Although the functions of its processing elements (PEs) and interconnections can be defined by a high-level software program, the circuit parameters are mostly managed by hardware or the compiler, leaving opportunities for in-depth optimization and novel features. Considering that the circuit adjustment is of great value in terms of low power and security, this article presents a novel software-defined accelerator named cross-domain software-defined chip (CDSDC), of which most chip properties including circuit parameters, logic, and pipelines can be programmed synergistically by software at runtime. With this design scheme, CDSDC provides new features including: 1) dynamic pipeline-voltage-frequency scaling (DPVFS), which combines pipeline reconfiguration with voltage-frequency scaling to generate an optimal chip configuration for various applications; 2) intrinsic physical unclonable function (PUF), which leverages the uniform PEs as measured circuit delay elements by adjusting the circuit parameters, extracting the entropy of manufacturing process variation, and taking response bits as a PUF; and 3) device-binding confidential configuration, which uses the intrinsic PUF and ASCON algorithm to encrypt/decrypt configuration. The CDSDC has been implemented in silicon as a 28-nm Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) HPC+ 1P8M 6-mm2 test chip, operating at peak 400 MHz and 0.9 V, achieving a peak energy efficiency of 51 GOPS/W.

However, its hard quantization nonlinearity makes it nontrivial to estimate its linearized gain and the power of the quantization error (QE) that it introduces, and hence can make the linearized analysis at the DPLL-system level inaccurate. This tutorial paper formulates a minimum-mean-square-error estimator that is used to provide an accurate linearized analysis of the TDC; it takes into account the interaction between the quantization characteristic of the TDC and the statistical properties of the input jitter of a frequency synthesizer in both integer-N and fractional-N modes. A strategy for minimizing the TDC&#8217;s QE is provided; so-designed TDCs with equidistant quantization thresholds are able to achieve optimum jitter minimization at both the TDC and DPLL levels. Finally, the effective linear operating region of such TDCs is derived, which explains when the &#8220;hard quantizer&#8221; can be regarded as an almost linear PD and when not. Behavioral simulations at the TDC-block and DPLL-system levels underpin our analysis.</description></item><item><title>Spurs in Fractional-N Frequency Synthesizers Resulting From Resolution Mismatch Between the Divider Controller and the DTC: Manifestations, Analysis, and Mitigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964399</link><description>The digital-to-time converter (DTC) used in fractional-N phase locked loops is designed to cancel the accumulated quantization error (QE) arising from the divider controller. In high-resolution synthesizers, the DTC performs an additional quantization when mapping the required high-resolution phase correction to its coarse-resolution output. This inherent hard quantization nonlinearity of the DTC, which is different from the DTC&#8217;s well-known soft integral nonlinearity, causes yet another kind of inexact cancellation of the QE and induces excess spurious tones that degrade the output phase noise and jitter. This paper reveals the root cause of the &#8220;DTC&#8217;s QE&#8221; and spectral manifestation of the DTC-quantization-induced (DQI) spurs. The waveform of the DTC&#8217;s QE is derived analytically; it shows that the DQI-spur pattern is (i) determined by the fractional frequency control word and the quantization resolution of the DTC, and (ii) is independent of the type, order, and modulus of the divider controller. In view of the fact that conventional DTC linearity enhancement techniques and stochastic divider controllers have no effect on DQI-spur mitigation, we propose a novel family of DTC-enhancement methods called input-dithered quantization (IDQ). When used in DTCs, the IDQ methods are effective in eliminating DQI spurs at source with negligible phase noise or jitter penalty.</description></item><item><title>A 48-dB Range, 0.86-dB Step, and 0.06-dB Error dB-Linear PGA Based on Resistive Ladder Attenuator: Design Theory and Realization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10765147</link><description>This paper presents the effective design theory and realization for a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) with extremely small gain error and high-resolution decibel (dB)-linear characteristic in a 48 dB gain control range. Based on the resistive ladder attenuator topology and the complementary binary-weighted switching technique, the gain error in digitally controlled dB-linear characteristic is significantly reduced by introducing an optimization factor in the pseudo-exponential function fitting. To achieve both extremely small gain error and a relatively wide gain range, an optimization method for trading off different types of gain error is employed to obtain the optimal optimization factor. An adaptive bias circuit is adopted to realize gain robustness to process and temperature variations.The proposed PGA is fabricated in a  $0.18~\mu $ m CMOS technology with a 0.063 mm2 core area. The power consumption is 5.3 mW at a supply voltage of 1.8 V. It provides a dB-linear gain range from &#8722;20 dB to 28 dB with a 0.86 dB gain step while the gain error is less than 0.06 dB. The PGA exhibits a &#8722;3 dB bandwidth of 80 MHz in various digital control words.

The base current compensation structure is designed to ensure the output accuracy of the LDO. Moreover, by designing the current-mode reference, the proposed LDO eliminates the thermal noise from the feedback resistor network and the amplification of the noise due to the feedback coefficient.

This leads to sensing failure due to the offset and long sensing time of the BLSA. To address this issue, various offset compensation methods and technologies that reduce sensing time have been proposed. However, these technologies still exhibit sensing failure due to long sensing times in low-power and large-capacity memory with low supply voltage and high  $C_{BLT}/C_{Cell}$  ratio. In addition, previous BLSAs require additional offset compensation time, which further increases the sensing time. A hidden-offset cancellation time and cross-coupled pre-sensing capacitor-coupled offset-canceled sense amplifier (HCP_COSA) are proposed to address these problems. To reduce the sensing time, the separate offset cancellation (OC) cycle is eliminated by performing OC for the cross-coupled inverter and charge-sharing simultaneously. In addition, the cross-coupled inverter operation is used in the pre-sensing phase to further amplify the reference bit line (BLB) voltage with the opposite polarity of the read-out signal, thereby improving both sensing margin and time. The proposed HCP_COSA achieves up to 18.5% faster sensing time at a supply voltage of 0.9 V by increasing the difference between the bit line (BLT) and the BLB by 2.55-3.76 times before starting the main sensing (MS) phase, compared with the previous works. In addition, the proposed architecture increases the number of word lines that can be sensed by up to 33.3% and achieves a sensing yield of 100% even at a low supply voltage of 0.65 V.</description></item><item><title>A 362-TOPS/W Mixed-Signal MAC Macro With Sampling-Weight-Nonlinearity Cancellation and Dynamic-Amplified Accumulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829503</link><description>This work presents a high energy-efficiency mixed-signal multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) macro in charge-domain for machine learning (ML) systems.

True VCO-ADC architectures have been proposed to increase the noise-shaping order by cascading several VCO integrators, but without requiring analog feedback loops. A high noise-shaping order allows to reduce the input VCO frequency compared to a conventional VCO-ADC with similar dynamic range, which improves power consumption. Prior-art True VCO-ADC architectures represent state variables either with a unity-weighted code or with a single-bit. Unity-weighted encoding is a natural choice when ring oscillators are selected as loop filter integrators. However, chip area restrictions force unity-weighted state variables to have few levels. A reduced number of levels in the state variables limits the dynamic range of True VCO-ADCs. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a second-order audio VCO-based ADC that uses ring oscillators as integrators but employs Gray and binary encoded state variables. As a consequence, the complexity and area of the True VCO-ADC architecture is reduced, breaking the barrier that limits the dynamic range of prior designs. The proof-of-concept chip shows a dynamic range of 103 dB achieving a peak SNDR of 76.5 dB-A with a power of  $250~\mu $ W occupying  $0.095~\text {mm}^{2}$  in 130 nm CMOS.</description></item><item><title>An 11-bit 360-MS/s Pipelined SAR ADC With Feedback Factor Compensation Using a Dynamic Negative-C-Assisted Residue Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758675</link><description>This paper presents an energy-efficient residue amplification for low-power high-speed pipelined SAR ADC, whose residue amplifier is assisted by a dynamic negative capacitance (NC) circuit at the virtual ground. This dynamic NC for the residue amplifier increases the feedback factor while maintaining the closed-loop signal gain, thereby relaxing the requirements of the residue amplifier such as unity-gain bandwidth and open-loop gain, which subsequently leads to a power reduction of the residue amplifier. The proposed dynamic NC addresses the issues associated with static counterparts while maintaining small gain error, increased effective bandwidth, and high energy efficiency. Fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, the prototype 11-bit pipelined SAR ADC achieves a signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 58 dB and a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 77.9 dB with Nyquist input at a sampling rate of 360-MS/s, while consuming only 3.9 mW from a 0.95 V supply. This corresponds to a Walden figure-of-merit (FoM) of 16.7 fJ/conv.-step, making this work competitive among the state-of-the-art ADCs with similar speed and resolution.</description></item><item><title>380-GHz Third Harmonic Signal Generation Using Differentially Pumped Varactors in a CMOS Voltage Controlled Oscillator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10870448</link><description>An LC-VCO incorporating differentially pumped varactors for  $3^{\mathrm {rd}}$  order harmonic generation is demonstrated in a 65-nm bulk CMOS process with an  $f_{max}$  of ~250 GHz.

To address this issue, we derive the noise transfer function of the loop&#8217;s equivalent current under  $\Sigma \Delta $  modulation by modeling the phase-locked loop based on linear system theory. Since the input signal is a random sequence that cannot be directly applied to a linear model analysis, this paper introduces a new mathematical model that functionalizes the input sequence. This functionalized random variable retains its original probability distribution and power spectrum, while providing a functional expression that can be integrated directly into the system&#8217;s transfer function for calculation. Furthermore, the model incorporates the input frequency information, which aids in analyzing the effects of nonlinearity. Using this functionalization method, we conduct a detailed analysis of the quantization noise folding phenomenon and derive exact equations for the noise floor and noise corner frequency under charge pump mismatch. Additionally, we present the complete power spectral density of the output noise under nonlinear effects. To validate the proposed model, a behavioral-level simulation is performed using MATLAB, with results showing strong agreement between the simulation and theoretical predictions, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Analyses Concerning the Phase Noise and Nonlinear Behavior of the Charge-Sharing Integrator-Based Hybrid PLL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10790864</link><description>Hybrid PLLs (HPLLs) leverage the advantages of conventional analog and digital PLLs to cater to the high integration demand inherent with the advanced CMOS nodes, among which the charge-sharing (CS) integrator-based HPLL featuring ultra-compact area and ultra-low power consumption exhibits promising prospects.

The proposed read-out IC consists of a capacitively coupled instrumentation amplifier (CCIA) and an incremental delta-sigma ( $\Delta \Sigma $ ) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). An impedance boosting technique, combining the conventional positive-feedback loop with a proposed fine current compensation loop (FCCL), is introduced to enhance the input impedance of the CCIA. Additionally, the proposed structure chops the entire signal chain at a global chopping frequency of 13.2 kHz, which is higher than the 1/f corner frequency of the CCIA&#8217;s main amplifier. This approach further increases the input impedance of the CCIA and eliminates the need for RRL and an analog low pass filter (LPF), thereby reducing circuit complexity and area. Local auto-zeroing and correlated double sampling techniques are also used to suppress the offset and 1/f noise of the read-out IC.

The popular high-sensitivity scheme is increasing the number of RF rectifier&#8217;s stages to output higher voltage which is suitable to supply downstream electronics. This will reduce the input signal amplitude and power conversion efficiency (PCE), which in turn needs more stages and is thus lost in a vicious circle. This paper uses an optimal-stage high-efficiency RF rectifier to solve this problem. A low-frequency (LF) charge pump (CP) is cascaded with the rectifier to raise the DC voltage. To further improve the sensitivity, the system uses a burst charging mode to remove the charge pump&#8217;s loading effect on the RF rectifier.

It achieves exceptional perceptual performance mainly by introducing a novel attention, multi-view cross-attention (MVCA), for learnable feature extraction and fusion from surround-view cameras. Despite its superiority, MVCA encounters severe inefficiencies in sample, processing elements (PE), and pipelined processing, owing to the redundant and non-uniform sampling-aggregation and rigorous inter-operator dependencies. To address these issues, this article proposes a dedicated MVCA accelerator, MVAtor, with algorithm-architecture co-optimization for vision-centric 3D perception based on multi-view inputs flexibly. For sample inefficiency, a 3-tier hybrid static-dynamic sample and a sensitivity-aware feature pruning approach are proposed to eliminate the 86.03% sample overhead and 24.48% memory requirement, only incuring &lt;1% accuracy loss with no need of fine-tuning.

For autonomous driving applications, an essential process for perceiving the mobile robot&#8217;s movements in 3D space is k-NN searching. Especially with the limited hardware resources of mobile processors, the 3D point cloud is too large to upload onto the chip, leading to  $O(N^{2})$  of external memory accesses and distance calculations. The proposed C2IM processor enhances energy efficiency and reduces power consumption through three key features: 1) Dilated 1D-CNN prediction enables voxel-based partitioning, reducing the external memory accesses from  $O(N^{2})$  to  $O(N)$ ; 2) Vertex clustering reorganizes groups of points into evenly distributed clusters based on the underlying data distribution and reduces the number of points of comparisons by 49.8%; and 3) In-memory k-NN searching with CAM achieves high system energy efficiency while minimizing data transactions between memory and computation logic. Designed with 28 nm CMOS technology, the proposed C2IM achieves up to  $23.08\times $  energy efficiency, and 48.4% reduction in memory footprint compared to previous ASIC accelerators, and a 99.51% reduction in power consumption compared to state-of-the-art processor implemented in FPGA with high-bandwidth memory.</description></item><item><title>An FPGA-Based Event-Driven SNN Accelerator for DVS Applications With Structured Sparsity and Early-Stop</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981802</link><description>This paper proposed an algorithm-hardware co-design of an event-driven spiking neural network (SNN) accelerator for classification tasks of event-based data from dynamic vision sensors (DVS), which can implement a feed-forward SNN with a maximum network size of 1 million synapses. Configurable structured sparsity is introduced between the first layer and the second layer to improve energy efficiency and balance the workload between different processing elements (PEs). The number of available neurons in the accelerator is sparsity-dependent and ranges from 1024 to 4096. The modified leaky-integrate-fire (LIF) neuron model and an event-driven neuron update scheme are employed in both algorithm and hardware to fully utilize the natural sparsity of DVS event stream. Early-stop inference strategy on the hardware enables a trade-off between inference accuracy and efficiency. A three-layer fully connected SNN is trained through backpropagation through time (BPTT) and is implemented and evaluated on Xilinx ZCU104 FPGA. Our design can achieve 96.0% accuracy on the N-MNIST dataset and 79.0% accuracy on the DVS128-Gesture dataset both at 50% sparsity. The top performance of the accelerator on ZCU104 is 3.22 GSOP/S and 3.99 GSOP/W at 250 MHz.</description></item><item><title>EdgeLLM: A Highly Efficient CPU-FPGA Heterogeneous Edge Accelerator for Large Language Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916480</link><description>The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the Large Language Models (LLMs), have profoundly affected our daily work and communication forms. However, it is still a challenge to deploy LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices (such as robots), due to the intensive computation requirements, heavy memory access, diverse operator types and difficulties in compilation. In this work, we proposed EdgeLLM to address the above issues. Firstly, focusing on the computation, we designed mix-precision processing element array together with group systolic architecture, that can efficiently support both FP $16\ast $ FP16 for the MHA block (Multi-Head Attention) and FP $16\ast $ INT4 for the FFN layer (Feed-Forward Network). Meanwhile specific optimization on log-scale structured weight sparsity, has been used to further increase the efficiency. Secondly, to address the compilation and deployment issue, we analyzed the whole operators within LLM models and developed a universal data parallelism scheme, by which all of the input and output features maintain the same data shape, enabling to process different operators without any data rearrangement. Then we proposed an end-to-end compiler to map the whole LLM model on CPU-FPGA heterogeneous system (AMD Xilinx VCU128 FPGA). The accelerator achieves  $1.91\times $  higher throughput and  $7.55\times $  higher energy efficiency than the commercial GPU (NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80G). When compared with state-of-the-art FPGA accelerator of FlightLLM, it shows 10-24% better performance in terms of HBM bandwidth utilization, energy efficiency and LLM throughput.</description></item><item><title>Simultaneous Optimization of Various-Sized SRAM Instances Through Machine Learning-Driven Transistor Sizing and Leafcell Circuit Pool Construction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856518</link><description>In this paper, we present a Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based methodology for optimizing SRAM design across various configurations while meeting stringent constraints in different Process, Supply voltage, and Temperature (PVT) corners. Our method automatically extracts critical design parameters for power reduction and accelerates optimization using a BO-based approach that suggests multiple points. Additionally, our method efficiently identifies the worst PVT corners, minimizing the number of simulations by considering constraints and utilizing cubic spline interpolation to simultaneously provide optimal circuits for various size instances. By applying our approach, we achieved a significant reduction in dynamic power by 10.24% to 28.55%, access time by 1.76% to 38.16%, and cycle time by 1.20% to 27.39% across all corners while satisfying all constraints. Additionally, assuming our approach is used to optimize all size instances that can be generated by a commercial compiler, the required runtime is reduced by 96.65% to 99.87% compared to using conventional Bayesian Optimization.</description></item><item><title>SecureX: Strategically Securing Designs Against Oracle-Less Attacks Using GNN-Based Explainers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988787</link><description>Logic locking is a promising design-for-trust solution that protects integrated circuits (ICs) from hardware security threats such as design intellectual property (IP) piracy and illegal overproduction of ICs. With the ubiquity of machine learning (ML), researchers have proposed various ML-based attacks against logic locking techniques in recent years. Since ML-based attacks operate as non-interpretable models, understanding the reasons behind the success/failure of such attacks is challenging. In this work, we propose SecureX, the first-of-its-kind technique that employs an explainable Graph Neural Network (GNN) to lock designs. The unique benefits of explainable GNN-based analysis include identifying the best locations in the design to lock, and the critical features (structural/functional) that make the designs vulnerable to ML-based attacks. Moreover, SecureX seamlessly integrates with state-of-the-art unbroken scan-chain protection techniques, thus thwarting oracle-guided attacks. We perform experiments on ITC-99 benchmarks and two types of locking techniques (X(N)OR/MUX-based locking) to demonstrate the efficacy of SecureX in locking designs resilient to ML/non-ML-based attacks. Our results confirm that the accuracy of the state-of-the-art ML/non-ML-based attacks drops to  $\approx 50\%$  while maintaining low area/power/delay overheads. Moreover, we perform a practical case study of locking an image-processing application.</description></item><item><title>A Heterogeneous System With Computing in Memory Processing Elements to Accelerate CNN Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902553</link><description>Computing in memory (CIM) is one of the promising solutions to improve computing performance by integrating logic in memory. This work presents an efficient heterogeneous system based on the ultrafast CIM architecture (HS-CIM) to accelerate convolutional neural network (CNN) inference. First, an ultrafast CIM architecture is proposed based on the static random access memory (SRAM) by utilizing the novel total input and full digital scheme to implement multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operation, which effectively addresses the high delay issue caused by high-precision computing in CIM architecture. Second, a heterogeneous system based on the proposed CIM architecture (HS-CIM) has been constructed with an aligned global cache and an adaptive pruning scheme to eliminate performance degradation and accuracy loss caused by input data bandwidth limitations. Meanwhile, efficient input data and weight data mapping schemes are proposed to minimize the delay and energy caused by input data transmission from the cache to the CIM architecture, thus realizing efficient CNN inference in the HS-CIM system. Finally, we analyze the performance of HS-CIM at the layout level by implementing the LeNet-5 and VGG models of CNN to recognize the image of MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. Results show that the energy efficiency of the proposed CIM architecture achieves 58.32 TOPS/W with 8-bit input/weight precision. Meanwhile, the inference accuracy of the HS-CIM system for MNIST and CIFAR-10 is 99.25% and 92.34%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Neural-Network-Assisted Chaos-NOMA Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10933575</link><description>We propose a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme based on three-dimensional chaotic attractors, which we denote chaos-NOMA. In this system, the chaotic signals transmitted by each user are generated from the state variables of the attractor. We employ a principal component analysis algorithm for dimensionality reduction and obtain an orthonormal basis and a signal constellation for the chaotic signals. The dynamical properties of these signals result in the transmission of time-varying waveforms, modeled as an intrinsic noise. Depending on factors such as the number of users and the power difference of the transmitted signals, this intrinsic noise can lead to a performance curve exhibiting an error floor. We propose a neural network architecture coupled to the demodulator to mitigate the impact of the intrinsic noise.</description></item><item><title>Optimized Algorithms for FPGA Implementation of PDCCH Chain for 5G-NR Base Station</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10835153</link><description>The physical layer in a cellular network base station typically runs on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) to enable reconfigurability and adaptability to meet future demands of the network with sufficient computational power. This work proposes a novel architecture and algorithms for the FPGA implementation of the fifth-generation (5G) new radio (NR) physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) using the 3GPP procedures for downlink control information (DCI) processing, including sub-block interleaver, bit selection, scrambling, golden sequence generation, and modulation. The proposed algorithms are optimized to meet 5G-NR frame timings for DCI processing with minimum power consumption and hardware resource utilization. We perform rigorous testing including all corner cases to benchmark our designs in i) standalone mode, and ii) integrated fashion for the end-to-end PDCCH processing. The PDCCH implementation, with maximum DCI payload, using the proposed architecture and algorithms achieves  $1.5 ~\mu s$  latency, 1.98% hardware resource utilization, 1.2 Gbps throughput and 10 Gbps/W power efficiency.

A lossless data compression method utilizing full rank decomposition transform is proposed to reduce redundant sensor data, thereby alleviating network transmission load. To further save communication resources and prolong network lifetimes, sensors use a stochastic event-triggered mechanism (SETM) to transmit compressed data to local estimators. However, SETM can be exploited by SEB attackers. We first derive local estimator iterations using Bayesian inference in both normal and attack scenarios. Moreover, the accuracy of fusion estimates can be guaranteed through the codesign of information compensation and an indexed transmission strategy that counteracts SEB attacks. Finally, this paper provides an upper bound for fusing error covariance under a diagonal matrix weighted fusion scheme, effectively balancing fusion estimation performance and resource demands. All theoretical results have been illustrated by the 5-Generator and 8-Line power system.</description></item><item><title>Decoupling Control of Fuel Cell Air Supply System Based on Data-Driven Feedforward and Adaptive Generalized Supertwisting Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10835123</link><description>Decoupling control of the air supply system is crucial for enhancing the performance and prolonging the service life of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. However, the strong coupling and nonlinearity inherent in the system pose significant challenges. Current decoupling techniques typically rely on model knowledge and commonly overlook the avoidance of compressor surge, which motivates our work with a twofold contribution. We first design a data-driven feedforward (DDF) and propose a feasible domain constraint (FDC) to avoid surge. Subsequently, an adaptive generalized supertwisting algorithm (AGSTA) is presented that eliminates the residual tracking errors of the DDF. Furthermore, its gradient descent principle and stability are demonstrated. The proposed method has been validated on an air supply system test bench and a hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) platform carrying a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) model. The results indicate that our approach is more advantageous in terms of tracking accuracy, response speed, overshoot suppression and computational cost.</description></item><item><title>Compact Balanced-to-Balanced Filtering Power Divider With Wide Range and High Level of Reflectionless, Isolation, Common-Mode Rejection, and Enhanced Frequency Selectivity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10810736</link><description>This paper presents a novel compact balanced-to-balanced (BTB) power divider featuring an exceptional reflectionless bandpass filtering response. A pair of three-line coupled structures (TLCSs) are utilized to provide wideband filtering response and equal power division. To enhance the frequency selectivity, an open-circuited stepped impedance stub is added to TLCSs, generating a pair of transmission zeros (TZs) on both sides of the passband. Additionally, simple absorption-isolation networks (AINs) consisting of two resistors and a half-wavelength transmission line (TL) are embedded to provide a full-band non-reflective response at the input port and achieve excellent isolation. The traditional half-wavelength TL between balanced ports is replaced by a stepped-impedance TL, improving in-band matching performance. Furthermore, a detailed theoretical analysis of the proposed design is derived, and parametric studies are presented. To verify the proposed concept, the new multifunctional BTB reflectionless filtering power divider (RFPD) operating at 1.9 GHz is fabricated and measured. The compact fabricated prototype exhibits a 10.8-dB input absorption, 21-dB common-mode (CM) suppression, and 22-dB isolation, all exceeding the bandwidth level of 263.2%. The results show good agreement between simulations and measurements.</description></item><item><title>An Advanced Fault-Tolerant HANPC Converter With Neutral-Point Voltage Balancing for Full Power Factor Range Under Multi-Switch Open-Circuit Fault</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10806789</link><description>Hybrid active neutral-point-clamped (HANPC) converters are receiving more attentions owing to considerable cost-effectiveness and high efficiency. However, when open-circuit fault occurs in multiple switches, the existing fault-tolerant schemes cannot support the HANPC converter to operate at rated output voltage and satisfactory neutral-point voltage balancing. To address this issue, an advanced fault-tolerant HANPC (FT-HANPC) converter is proposed, which is equipped with shared fault management unit (SFMU) and voltage ripple suppression unit (VRSU). The proposed discontinuous space vector modulation strategy enables SFMU to take over the multiple faulty switches with minimal redundant active switches. Moreover, the VRSU with proposed control strategy is activated to effectively regulate neutral-point voltage for full power factor range under fault condition. The operation principle and fault-tolerant control of proposed topology are elaborated, respectively. Experimental results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed topology.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Sparse LQR Control for Power Systems With Markov Jump Interconnection Topologies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758712</link><description>In this paper, we consider a class of stochastic interconnected power systems that involve multiple generators exchanging information through a specialized interconnection structure. In practical scenarios, due to unpredictable transient events such as faults, load changes, and attacks, the inter-generator interconnection structure undergoes random alterations. By employing Markov Chain to model the stochastically varying interconnection topology between generators, we establish a stochastic interconnected power system (SIPS) characterized by markov jump interconnection topologies. Leveraging the stochastic interconnection structure of the SIPS, we formulate a distributed sparse Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control problem and analyze the stability of the closed-loop SIPS under sparse control, as well as its optimality given interconnection structure constraints. Based on scaling technology, we introduce a new model-based Sparse Scaling Policy Iteration (SSPI) algorithm to effectively compute distributed optimal controllers under these sparse constraints. Furthermore, a model-free SSPI is developed for scenarios where system dynamics are unknown, removing there liance on system dynamics and avoiding the need for an initially stabilizing controller. This paper also provides theoretical guarantees for the stability and convergence of the SSPI. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the SSPI through an application to an interconnected three-generator power system.</description></item><item><title>Proportional-Integral and Nonlinear Cubic Control to Enhance Small-Signal and Transient Stability of EV Charging Station and DC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11061814</link><description>A proportional-integral (PI) controller in parallel with a nonlinear cubic controller is proposed in order to achieve the objective of addressing both the issues of small-signal and large-signal stability, with the latter also being referred to as transient stability. Within the scope of application and of practical relevance is the enhancement of the region of attraction for which equilibrium states are found for an electric vehicle (EV) charging station while considering constraints. As a main contribution, a methodology for the design of the cubic controller to expand the constrained region of attraction (CROA) through sum-of-squares (SOS) programming is formulated, implemented, and validated. The developed SOS program incorporates the construction of Lyapunov functions, which are employed to estimate the CROA. The optimal coefficient of the cubic controller is obtained by estimating the largest CROA. The integration of the cubic controller enhances the robustness of the EV charging station against large disturbances, while the performance under minor disturbances is dealt with by the accompanying PI controller. As a result, the proposed PI-cubic voltage controller enhances the stability across wide operating ranges including fast charging and in the presence of constant power loads. In general, application also includes DC microgrid stability. Time-domain simulations conducted in Matlab validate the made claims. During the considered outage of local power generation on the DC side of the charging station and microgrid, transient stability was only maintained with the proposed controller, and an overcurrent situation was avoided. The PI-cubic controller is shown to be effective in enhancing robustness.</description></item><item><title>A Peak-Injection CLS Technique for PVT-Robust Switched-Capacitor Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11007089</link><description>This brief proposes a peak-injection correlated-level shifting (PICLS) technique to enhance the equivalent gain of an amplifier against process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, thereby improving robustness.

One potential solution to mitigate the problem is utilizing the existing traction DC grid infrastructure for EV charger connections. Such solution allows exploiting already existing traction substation equipment for both EV charging and powering DC traction grids, potentially reducing charging station installation costs. At the same time, bidirectional EV charger operation allows providing services such as DC grid voltage stabilization and traction transport braking energy recuperation. Therefore, this brief examines a scalable multiport DC-DC converter, suitable for multiterminal EV charging stations, located in the proximity to DC traction networks. The use of a multiport converter allows for sharing electric components across multiple ports, reducing the total number of elements required, compared to conventional solutions, where each EV charger relies on a separate converter.</description></item><item><title>Atleus: Accelerating Transformers on the Edge Enabled by 3D Heterogeneous Manycore Architectures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10844861</link><description>Transformer architectures have become the standard neural network model for various machine learning (ML) applications, including natural language processing and computer vision. However, the compute and memory requirements introduced by transformer models make them challenging to adopt for edge applications. Furthermore, fine-tuning pretrained transformers (e.g., foundation models) is a common task to enhance the model&#8217;s predictive performance on specific tasks/applications. Existing transformer accelerators are oblivious to complexities introduced by fine-tuning. In this article, we propose the design of a three-dimensional (3D) heterogeneous architecture referred to as Atleus that incorporates heterogeneous computing resources specifically optimized to accelerate transformer models for the dual purposes of fine-tuning and inference. Specifically, Atleus utilizes nonvolatile memory and systolic array for accelerating transformer computational kernels using an integrated 3D platform. Moreover, we design a suitable NoC to achieve high performance and energy efficiency. Finally, Atleus adopts an effective quantization scheme to support model compression. Experimental results demonstrate that Atleus outperforms existing state-of-the-art by up to  $56\times $  and  $64.5\times $  in terms of performance and energy efficiency, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Approx-T: Design Methodology for Approximate Multiplication Units via Taylor-Expansion</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10849621</link><description>Approximate computing is emerging as a promising approach to devising energy-efficient IoT systems by exploiting the inherent error-tolerant nature of various applications. In this article, we present Approx-T, to tackle several major challenges according to the prior state-of-the-art (SOTA) approximate multiplication units (AMUs)&#8212;lack of comprehensive optimization formulation, asymmetric error distribution, nonadjustable runtime precision, and exponentially growing area complexity when adding up error compensation levels. We innovatively conduct an in-depth study on approximate multiplier via Taylor-expansion to address these issues. 1) Incorporate the Taylor&#8217;s theorem into the design concept of approximate arithmetic multipliers. 2) Leverage the inherent symmetrical error distribution of Taylor series to conduct unbiased approximations. 3) Present a runtime configurable error compensation architecture with low-complexity arithmetic operations. We implemented both approximate unsigned and signed integer and floating multiplication arithmetic units and compared with the SOTA works. The experimental results demonstrate that Approx-T surpasses other designs in all metrics, encompassing precision, area utilization, and power consumption. Furthermore, when deployed on an embedded field programmable gate array platform to assess a spectrum of edge computing tasks, Approx-T showcases remarkable performance. Particularly in CNN applications, it achieves up to a  $10.7\times $  enhancement in energy efficiency, while maintaining negligible impact on accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Single-Pass: An Operation Unit-Based In-Memory Computing Architecture for Sparse Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10876165</link><description>Compute-in-memory (CIM) has emerged as a prominent research focus in recent years, offering a promising alternative for advancing traditional von Neumann architecture computers. However, the extensive array structures and peripheral circuits inherent in CIM introduce challenges related to latency and power consumption. The operation unit (OU) has gained attention as a practical solution to these issues, significantly transforming the computational paradigm of in-memory computing. Despite its potential, the possibilities enabled by this approach remain underexplored. This article presents a novel architecture, single-pass, designed around OU implementation with a new OU partitioning method optimized for sparse networks. Additionally, we propose a matrix compression technique leveraging a dual heuristic greedy algorithm (DHGA), forming the foundation of our architecture-specific mapping strategy.

To improve the resource utilization and handle the mixing workloads in the real-world, multiple tasks sharing the whole CGRA has became an important technical trend, and the varying resource requirements throughout their life cycles also makes run-time dynamic resource allocation (DRA) necessary for higher-multitask throughput. As the key stage of DRA, dynamic mapping (DM) is responsible for mapping kernels within each task to the dynamically allocated CGRA resources. However, existing DM methods have difficulty to balance the mapping time and the mapping quality, resulting in a significant gap between the actual and the optimal task throughput. To address the challenge, we propose DynMap, a heuristic dynamic mapper for CGRA multitask DRA. With the support of specialized scheduling and routing schemes, DynMap heuristically references the placement tendency in the static mapping result to dramatically save the mapping time, while maintaining the high-mapping quality by minimizing the possibility of resource conflicts. Experimental evaluation demonstrates DynMap not only achieves the average 1.17 ms mapping time and average 98.33% of the optimal mapping quality on different CGRA architectures, but also reaches average 98.85% of the optimal task throughput expected by different CGRA multitask DRA scenarios, reducing the gap between actual and optimal task throughput average  $31.75\times $  smaller than that of the current methods.</description></item><item><title>MACS: A Multidomain Collaborative Adaptive Clock Scheme for Large-Scale Reconfigurable Dataflow Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10851296</link><description>To guarantee reliability and correctness, VLSI circuits are designed with conservative margins to maintain timing and power integrity against process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations across diverse workloads. However, worst-case PVT and workload conditions rarely occur in practice, resulting in significant timing slack and hence performance and energy loss, especially in reconfigurable dataflow accelerator RDA due to their large-scale and configurable features. Previous studies have attempted to exploit workload or PVT slack, yet achieving limited benefits for reconfigurable dataflow accelerator (RDAs) with large-scale processing element PE arrays. The key issues come from restricted scaling ranges for the clock, insufficient representations for the workload, and unbalanced workloads within processing elementss (PEs). To address these challenges, this article proposes the first multidomain collaborative adaptive clock scheme (MACS) to efficiently exploit both the workload and PVT timing slack for large-scale reconfigurable dataflow acceleratorss (RDAs). MACS partitions the RDA into several clock domains and allows constrained clock domain crossing, which enhances the hardware efficiency with minimal overhead and supports timing validation using conventional static timing analysis (STA) tools. In each domain, an operand-aware workload detection unit is developed, using both static configurations and dynamic operands to assess workload. The detected workload, combined with the monitored PVT conditions, determines the subsequent clock period. Additionally, to enable the exploration of timing slack over a broader range, the period range of the adaptive clock is extended. Experimental results show that MACS achieves a performance improvement of 76.3% or an energy saving of 36.6% with a hardware cost of 3.5%.</description></item><item><title>Re-CATA: Real-Time and Flexible Accelerator Design Framework for On-Device Codec Avatars</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10876391</link><description>Real-time Codec Avatars, which employ deep generative models for 3-D reconstruction of human features, are crucial for immersive telepresence in augmented reality and virtual reality (AR/VR) environments. However, deploying these avatars in real-time on AR/VR headsets is challenging due to the inability of existing devices to achieve satisfying performance within stringent hardware resource constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce Re-CATA, an innovative full-stack and flexible Codec Avatar accelerator design framework. Re-CATA is designed to deliver real-time throughput (greater than 120 FPS) for the complete Codec Avatar processing pipeline within an edge-level power budget of 5 W under FPGA prototyping. Our approach begins by abstracting the operation mapping and scheduling challenges inherent in Codec Avatars, which require both centralized and distributed processing to handle dynamically changing workloads. We propose a novel hardware resource and workload partitioning scheme optimized for these fluctuating demands. To complement this, we introduce an agile runtime scheduling system for efficient workload reallocation among computing units as needed, recognizing the limitations of static partitioning in rapidly evolving workload scenarios. Furthermore, our micro-architecture design incorporates unified computing modules and efficient hardware peripherals, enabling seamless workload balancing across the Codec Avatar processing pipeline. We evaluate the Re-CATA accelerators via on-board FPGA prototyping, comparing them to various baselines, including commercial AR/VR system-on-chips and academic accelerators. This evaluation demonstrates a maximum speedup of up to  $5.95\times $  under similar settings.</description></item><item><title>Reducing Transistor Count in CMOS Logic Design Through Clustering and Library-Independent Multiple-Output Logic Synthesis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10870256</link><description>We propose a novel transistor-level synthesis method to minimize the number of transistors needed to implement a digital circuit. In contrast with traditional standard cell design methods or transistor-level synthesis methods based on single-input &#8220;complex&#8221; gates or &#8220;super&#8221; gates, our method considers multioutput clusters as the basic resynthesis unit. Our tool takes any gate-level circuit netlist as input and divides it into several clusters of user-controlled size. For each output of a cluster, a simplified sum of product (SOP) expression is obtained and all such expressions are jointly minimized for the cluster using the MOTO-X multioutput transistor-level synthesis tool. Then, we consider groups of clusters, referred to as &#8220;superclusters,&#8221; to collectively reduce the overall transistor count. Experimental results indicate average transistor count reductions compared to the ABC synthesis tool of 9.95%, 6.53%, 10.49%, 13.09%, and 9.76% for the ISCAS&#8217;85, LGSynth&#8217;89, LGSynth&#8217;91, EPFL&#8217;15 and ITC&#8217;99 benchmark suites, respectively. Furthermore, our proposed approach proves to be more efficient than the transistor-mapped binary decision diagram approach, highlighting the potential of our methodology for optimizing integrated circuits at the transistor-level while delivering enhancements in power efficiency and demonstrating varied improvements in delay performance.</description></item><item><title>GIRD: A Green IR-Drop Estimation Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10852017</link><description>An energy-efficient high-performance static IR-drop estimation method based on green learning called Green IR Drop (GIRD) is proposed in this work. GIRD processes the IC design input in three steps. First, the input netlist data are converted to multichannel maps. Their joint spatial&#8211;spectral representations are determined with PixelHop. Next, discriminant features are selected using the relevant feature test (RFT). Finally, the selected features are fed to the eXtreme Gradient Boosting trees regressor. Both PixelHop and RFT are green learning tools. GIRD yields a low carbon footprint due to its smaller model sizes and lower computational complexity. Besides, its performance scales well with small training datasets. Experiments on synthetic and real circuits are given to demonstrate the superior performance of GIRD. The model size and the complexity, measured by the floating point operations (FLOPs) of GIRD, are only  $10^{-3}$  and  $10^{-2}$  of deep-learning methods, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Bayesian Learning-Enhanced Embedded Memory Design With Automated Circuit Variant Generation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10844872</link><description>This article proposes a Bayesian learning driven automated embedded memory design methodology that aims to minimize leakage current, minimize power, and maximize performance while meeting predefined constraints.

However, the increasing on-package routing density and data rates of these links introduce complex signal and power integrity challenges, surpassing those encountered in traditional large monolithic chips. Addressing these complexities with efficient analysis and design tools is crucial for maintaining design robustness. In this article, we propose SPIRAL+: signal-power integrity co-analysis framework for high-speed interchiplet serial links validation. The framework employs machine learning (ML) to construct transmitter models and utilizes an impulse response extraction method for modeling the channel and receiver. It then performs signal-power integrity co-analysis through a novel double-edge response-based method, leveraging the developed equivalent models. Additionally, an efficient ML model is crafted to accurately predict eye diagram metrics. The analysis provides valuable insights for design optimization. Experimental results show that SPIRAL+ achieves eye diagrams with a mean relative error of 0.07%&#8211;7.47%, while realizing a speedup of  $31\times $ &#8211; $326\times $  over traditional commercial tools.</description></item><item><title>SANA-FE: Simulating Advanced Neuromorphic Architectures for Fast Exploration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869378</link><description>Neuromorphic computing is concerned with designing computer architectures inspired by the brain, with recent work focusing on platforms to efficiently execute large spiking neural networks (SNNs). Future designs are expected to improve their capabilities and performance by incorporating novel features, such as emerging neuromorphic devices and analog computation. There is, however, a lack of high-level performance estimation tools to evaluate the impact of such features at the architectural level, to evaluate architectural tradeoffs, and to aid with co-design and design-space exploration. Existing neuromorphic simulators either do not consider hardware performance, only model abstract SNN dynamics or are targeted to a single specific architecture. In this work, we propose SANA-FE, a novel simulator that can rapidly and accurately estimate performance and energy efficiency of different SNN-based designs. Our simulator uses a general and configurable architecture description format that can specify a wide range of neuromorphic designs. Using such an architecture description, SANA-FE simulates system activity when executing a given spiking application at an abstract time-step granularity, and it uses activity counts and per-activity performance metrics to estimate energy and latency for each time-step. We further show a calibration methodology and apply it to model performance of Intel&#8217;s Loihi platform. Results demonstrate that our simulator can predict Loihi&#8217;s energy and latency for three real-world applications, within 12% and 25%, respectively. We further model IBM&#8217;s TrueNorth architecture, simulating a random network over  $20\times $  faster than existing discrete-event-based TrueNorth simulators. Finally, we demonstrate SANA-FE&#8217;s design-space exploration capabilities by optimizing a Loihi baseline architecture for two application, reducing run-time by 21% while increasing dynamic energy usage by only 2%.</description></item><item><title>HISIM: Analytical Performance Modeling and Design Space Exploration of 2.5D/3D Integration for AI Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10844846</link><description>Monolithic designs face significant fabrication cost and data movement challenges, especially when executing complex and diverse AI models.

The suggested approach iteratively and incrementally optimizes the placement of macros in order to enhance IC layout routability and timing performance. To achieve this,  $\textsf {IncreMacro}$  utilizes several methods, including kd-tree-based macro diagnosis, gradient-based macro shifting, constraint-graph-based LP for macro legalization, and diffusion-based cell migration. By employing these techniques iteratively,  $\textsf {IncreMacro}$  meets two critical solution requirements of macro placement: 1) pushing macros toward the chip boundary and 2) preserving the original macro relative positional relationship. The proposed approach has been incorporated into  $\textsf {AutoDMP}$  and  $\textsf {DREAMPlace}~4.0$ , and is evaluated on seven RISC-V benchmark circuits and four TILOS macro placement circuit designs at the 7-nm technology node. Experimental results show that, compared with the macro placement solution provided by  $\textsf {AutoDMP}~(\textsf {DREAMPlace}~4.0$ ), our approach reduces routed wirelength by 15.1% (14.9%), improves the routed worst negative slack (WNS) and total negative slack (TNS) by 99.9 (82.6%) and 99.9% (81.3%), and reduces the total power consumption by 4.4% (4.3%). Meanwhile, compared with  $\textsf {IncreMacro}$  [1], our approach augmented with the cell migration algorithm improves the routed WNS and TNS by 24.7% and 23.1%, and remains the average routed wirelength and total power consumption almost unchanged.</description></item></channel></rss>
