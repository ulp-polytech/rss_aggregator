To enhance the reliability of subsea input-series output-parallel (ISOP) dc converters, this article proposes a multilevel synergistic fault-tolerant strategy that takes into account the challenges of large input voltage fluctuations and limited electrical monitoring. Unlike conventional fixed-threshold methods, the proposed scheme leverages the dynamic voltage&#8211;current time-domain signatures of submodules during incipient faults for real-time monitoring and fault localization, thereby maintaining robustness against input voltage variations. Furthermore, a redundant bypass circuit based on current-limiting resistor multiplexing is incorporated to improve the traditional topology. When combined with a smooth redundancy switching mechanism, this approach effectively mitigates transient electrical stresses on healthy modules during fault transitions. These enhancements collectively ensure the operational safety of both the subsea converter and associated high-precision deep-sea equipment. Finally, a comprehensive fault-tolerant control scheme is developed to guarantee the reliable operation of the subsea dc power supply system following fault occurrences.</description></item><item><title>Compact Interleaved PCB Rogowski Coil Array for Chip Current Measuring in SiC MOSFET Power Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11182315</link><description>The use of printed circuit board (PCB) Rogowski coils to measure chip currents in power modules may significantly help address current imbalance problems that lead to derating or overcurrent failure. Compared to silicon-based power devices, silicon carbide (SiC) power modules feature smaller chips and more compact chip arrangements. This necessitates more compact current measuring probes. This paper proposes a novel design method for PCB Rogowski coil arrays that utilizes the interturn spacing to achieve an interleaved arrangement of Rogowski coils, thereby solving manufacturability problems while increasing the mutual inductance of the Rogowski coils. For a prototype SiC mosfet power module, given the same spatial constraints, the coil array with the interleaved arrangement exhibits an average mutual inductance that is 98% higher than that of a coil array with the conventional arrangement. The circuit of the Rogowski transducer, consisting of the Rogowski coil and an integrator, is presented. The packaging processes for integrating the interleaved PCB Rogowski coil array into the power module are also described. The sensitivity of the Rogowski transducer is evaluated, and the impact of capacitive coupling interference is assessed. The switching currents of the 12 SiC mosfet chips are measured using the interleaved PCB Rogowski coil array in a double-pulse test, which reveals the detailed commutation behavior within the power module. The interleaved PCB Rogowski coil array proves to be an effective current measurement tool for densely arranged branches, providing a foundation for measuring the internal chip current distribution of power modules.</description></item><item><title>Electro&#8211;Thermal Coupling Characteristics of GaN SBDs Under HPM Pulses: Effect of Dislocation Density and Deep Learning Predictive Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11181199</link><description>Gallium nitride (GaN) Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs), as essential devices in power-electronic systems, are particularly vulnerable to high-power microwave (HPM) pulses. HPM pulses can induce electro&#8211;thermal multiphysics coupling effects in the GaN SBDs, potentially leading to device damage or failure. Dislocation density, as a critical parameter of GaN materials, has a significant effect on the performance of GaN SBDs. In this article, we present an electro&#8211;thermal multiphysics coupling analysis of GaN SBDs under HPM pulses, with particular emphasis on the influence of dislocation density on this coupling. Furthermore, by integrating deep learning techniques with technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulations, we propose a deep multihead attention residual network (DMARN) model that enables the rapid and accurate prediction of maximum electric field strength and temperature within GaN SBDs under varying dislocation density configurations and HPM pulse parameters. Through the validation of ablation and comparative experiments, an additional test set, and hardware experiments, the DMARN model demonstrates outstanding performance and generalization ability.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Lifetime Estimation and Supervised Voltage Regulation of Flying Capacitors in a Three-Phase Four-Level Three-Capacitor Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11190020</link><description>Three-phase four-level three-capacitor converter (3P4L3C) employs a single flying capacitor per phase, eliminating redundant switching states. However, this topology presents a significant challenge in capacitor voltage regulation, as conventional modulation techniques, including carrier-based SPWM and SVM, fail to maintain voltage balance. This article proposes a supervised voltage regulation method that dynamically adjusts duty ratios to compensate for capacitor voltage deviations, ensuring stable operation. Beyond regulation, a unified electrothermal lifetime evaluation framework is introduced to quantify how improved regulation impacts capacitor reliability. The framework integrates ripple-spectrum-based ESR loss calculation, hotspot temperature estimation, nonlinear damage accumulation, and Monte Carlo simulation under realistic mission profiles. Simulation and experimental results confirm that the proposed supervised voltage regulation achieves stable capacitor voltage regulation while reducing ripple current and thermal stress. As a result, the 3P4L3C converter demonstrates approximately 20% longer capacitor lifetime compared to the conventional 3P4L6C topology, highlighting the benefit of integrating control and reliability assessment within a single design framework.</description></item><item><title>Improved Fault Diagnosis Capability in CHBMCs: Counter Design for Multiple OC Switches via an E-SVM Unit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11193970</link><description>The cascaded H-bridge multilevel converter (CHBMC) is widely used in medium- and high-voltage applications due to its flexibility and scalability. However, its numerous switches make it prone to open-circuit (OC) faults, which lead to overshoot currents and increased harmonics, while unbalanced dc capacitor voltages can destabilize the system. To resolve the aforementioned issues, this article proposes an enhanced space vector modulation (E-SVM) unit that uses counters for multiple OC switch fault diagnosis and incorporates dc capacitor voltage balancing capability. In conjunction with the E-SVM unit, the zero level per power cell helps identify faulty switches, while redundant space vectors balance dc capacitor voltages. Switching losses are minimized by optimizing the switching transition, and a voltage balancing degree quantifies the boundary of the unbalanced loads. The E-SVM is software-based, level-independent, and control-agnostic by the control unit. It ensures seamless CHBMC operation. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by comparing the verification results with theoretical predictions.</description></item><item><title>VSC Converter Feedback Control Data Optimization Based IGBT Collector Emitter Saturation Voltage Monitoring Through Nonlinear Least Squares Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11197693</link><description>Power switching device insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is a key component in the power conversion system (PCS). Fatigue-induced aging of its electrical characteristics can lead to serious degradation of PCS, such as increased losses and temperatures, fault shutdowns or equipment damage, even safety risks for the battery units. The collector-emitter saturation voltage Vce is an essential indicator of IGBT health status, and the monitoring this on-state saturation voltage can effectively assess its operational health. However, data-driven modeling-based monitoring algorithms are highly dependent on data quality and scale, and substandard data quality can cause significant deviations in the data model, besides extra sensors may not be feasible to be implemented on existing converters. To tackle these challenges, this article introduces a PCS feedback control data based nonlinear least squares curve fitting algorithm for the precise identification of the saturation voltage of IGBT. The PCS model has been established, which incorporate the IGBT dead-time switching character to enhance the accuracy. Additionally, for the collected feedback control data, a Kalman filter observer is constructed to reduce data deviations and noise interference, successfully mitigating the impact of sampling noise on identification accuracy. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed IGBT on-state saturations voltage monitoring method are verified through MATLAB/Simulink simulations and experimental setup.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Flexible Thyristor Switch Modules Based AC Chopper for the Renewable Energy VSC-HVDC Transmission System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11145234</link><description>The renewable energy voltage sourced converter based high-voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) system has a broad application prospect, and the ac chopper (ACC) is the core equipment to realise the system fault ride-through (FRT). The traditional ACC consists of multiple three-phase energy-dissipation valves, which require a large number of thyristors, cover a large area, and are difficult to accurately match dissipated power, which restricts its further promotion and application. In this article, the flexible thyristor switch modules based ac chopper (FTSM-ACC) is proposed, which adopts diode bridges for rectification and combines with thyristor energy-dissipation switches to reduce the cost and volume while realizing the flexible casting and cutting of the FTSM-ACC, which provides a new way of thinking for the improvement of the technological and economic performance of ACC. Further, the FTSM-ACC control strategy and key parameter coordination method are proposed. And the system simulation is carried out to analyze the system FRT characteristics of FTSM-ACC. On this basis, a 4-kV/3.2 MW FTSM-ACC prototype is built, and the experimental results verify the effectiveness of FTSM-ACC and demonstrate its advantages over traditional ACC. Finally, the performance and economic efficiency of different ACCs are compared. Compared with the traditional ACC, the FTSM-ACC improves the performance by more than 50%, and the total cost and volume are reduced by 33% and 46%, which has a great performance and economic advantage.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Layer Energy Equalization for Series Battery Packs by Scheduling the Balancing Current With an Improved Model Prediction Controller</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11146528</link><description>This article designs a dual-layer hardware topology for series battery packs to realize the synchronous energy transfer among cells in the same module and cells across different modules. A bus-type flying-inductor structure is employed as the bottom-layer functional block, with sufficient dead-time gaps inserted between switches to mitigate mosfet heating caused by short-circuits. In order to maintain the energy throughput capability, auxiliary components are added for inductor current freewheeling, thereby facilitating the charge transfer between target cells. Then, a typical transformer is adopted as the top-layer functional block to directly balance the selected cells in different modules. Subsequently, considering constraints regarding the withstand voltage and maximum current of the tubes, the model prediction control is improved with multiobjective optimization gain-scheduling mechanism to determine the balancing currents for both layers, wherein the gain matrix is adjusted according to the remaining charge deviations between cells. Experimental verifications conducted on a pack consisting of nine cells divided into three modules indicate that compared with traditional methods, the proposed equalization scheme exhibits superior performance in terms of balanced energy transfer timeliness and efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Investigation of an Easy-Structured and Cost-Effective Energy-Storage System in the DC-Bus</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11150571</link><description>This article presents a new approach of an energy-storage technique for feedback-energy of drive-systems. A well-known state-of-the-art technology for high-power application, is to feed the energy back into the grid using a three-phase full-bridge. However, for smaller drive-systems this is not feasible due to cost and efficiency reasons. Here it is more advantageous to store the fed-back energy directly in the dc-bus. The simplest approach of storing energy directly in the capacitor of the rectifier is limited due to capacitance and voltage issues. Using additional large storage capacitors, such as ultracapacitors, directly in the dc-bus is limited by their voltage ratings. Therefore, a prior and bidirectional dc/dc-conversion is required, which has also disadvantages in terms of costs and efficiency. The new approach presented in this article allows storage capacitors to be operated directly in the dc-bus without prior dc/dc-conversion, which reduces costs, increases the efficiency, and results in an optimal cost-benefit ratio. The principal function of this new current-source-based energy-storage is shown by a detailed description of the topology, its modeling, and an evaluation using simulations and measurements. It turns out that the disclosed new approach is a promising alternative to the prior dc/dc-conversion.</description></item><item><title>Supercapacitor Internal Resistance Mitigation for Rapid Inertia Emulation of Renewable Power Generation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11150529</link><description>Inertia emulation control (INEC) using supercapacitors (SC) has become an appealing approach to effectively enhance the frequency stability of modern low-inertia power grids. However, considerable internal resistance (IR) existing in commercially available SCs may adversely degrade the speed and accuracy of SC-based inertial response, which has been neglected by existing INEC schemes. To tackle this issue, this article proposes an SC IR mitigation (SCIRM) for rapid INEC, consisting of an online IR identification module to obtain up-to-date IR value through fictitious frequency ramp injection and an IR mitigation control to compensate for the voltage deviation across the identified IR. The small-signal stability of the SCIRM-based rapid INEC scheme is strengthened through control parameter optimization. The effectiveness of the scheme in correcting SC inertial response as well as promoting power system frequency stability is evaluated through experimental verifications using a 10 kW testbed and simulation studies using a modified IEEE 39-bus New England system.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Multiport Hybrid DCCB Employing an LC Resonant Circuit for Enhanced Functionality</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11154850</link><description>Multiport hybrid dc circuit breakers (M-HCBs) are considered a suitable solution for protecting multiterminal direct current grids, as the expensive main breaker (MB) is shared among adjacent lines connected to a common bus. However, MBs in most M-HCBs still utilize expensive fully controlled semiconductor devices. In this article, a novel thyristor-based multiport HCB (T-MHCB) is proposed to solve this issue, and it has several other advantages. First, the fully controlled semiconductor devices in the MB are replaced with thyristors to inherit some advantages of thyristors. Second, an LC resonant circuit is employed in the proposed T-MHCB to turn off the thyristor in MB and avoid the overvoltage problem during the reverse recovery process. Third, through the LC resonant circuit, the capacitor can be restored to its initial state after the first current breaking process. As a result, the fast-reclosing protection function is provided with no need for additional power supply. Fourth, simple operation sequences reduce the control complexity and enhance its reliability. The topology introduction, operation principles, mathematical analysis, parameter design guidelines, simulation results, experimental results, and comparison study of the proposed T-MHCB are all presented.</description></item><item><title>A Combined PWM and Phase-Shift Control Method With Adaptive ZVS Boundary Regulation for Bridge-Arm Reused FSBB-LLC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11157837</link><description>The four-switch buck-boost (FSBB) converter cascaded with LLC resonant converter can achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS) of power switches and wide-range voltage regulation. To improve the power density and reduce the costs, the bridge arms in the two converters can be reused, thereby forming the bridge-arm reused FSBB-LLC converter. However, the reuse of bridge arms reduces the degrees of control freedom, which is detrimental to the realization of ZVS. In this article, a combined PWM and phase-shift control method with adaptive ZVS boundary regulation for FSBB-LLC converter is proposed, which realizes ZVS of power switches while maximizes the reduction on inductor current ripple in the full range (full voltage and load range). First, the ZVS conditions of power switches along with the selection principle of the inductor are revealed. Then, the basic idea of the adaptive ZVS boundary regulation and its design method are proposed. Based on that, a combined PWM and phase-shift control method and its implementation for the FSBB-LLC converter are proposed, which not only realizes full-range ZVS but also maximizes the reduction on inductor current ripple. Finally, a prototype of a 500-W FSBB-LLC converter is built and tested in the lab. The experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control method.</description></item><item><title>Overview of Efficient and Reliable Control Strategies for Three-Level NPC-Based DAB Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11159264</link><description>Dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter has been widely employed in isolated dc&#8211;dc power transmission applications due to its advantages of high power density, inherent soft-switching capability, galvanic isolation, high step-up ratio, and bidirectional power transfer. With the advancement of medium-voltage dc (MVDC) systems, some multilevel dc&#8211;dc converters, evolved from two-level DAB converter, have emerged to meet the high-voltage and high-power demands. Among various multilevel variants of DAB converter, the neutral-point-clamping (NPC)-based DAB converters have gained increasing attention in recent years due to simplified control structure, relatively low costs, and widespread commercialization. The overall performance of MVDC systems depends highly on the efficiency and reliability of DAB converters. Therefore, this article presents a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art control strategies aimed at enhancing efficiency and reliability in NPC-based DAB converters. The review covers modulation schemes designed to optimize converter efficiency, categorized by degrees of freedom, solution types, optimization objectives, and algorithms. Furthermore, control strategies to improve converter reliability, including neutral-point voltage balancing, fault diagnosis and tolerance, transient-state dc bias suppression, and power loss balancing, are exhibited in detail. Finally, the challenges remaining in prior efficiency- and reliability-oriented design are discussed, and corresponding potential research directions are identified to further advance the performance of multilevel DAB converters.</description></item><item><title>Fixed-Frequency K+2D Modulation of Modular Multilevel Resonant DC/DC Converter for All Submodule ZVS Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11162695</link><description>Modular multilevel resonant dc&#8211;dc converters (MMRDCs) are increasingly recognized as competitive solutions for medium-voltage to low-voltage (MV-LV) conversion with wide input ranges. However, these systems often face challenges of low conversion efficiency due to the inability to achieve sufficient soft-switching or excessive conduction loss. This article proposes a novel fixed-frequency K+2D control strategy, which combines submodule (SM) number K and 2 SMs adjusting width D. This approach ensures zero-voltage switching (ZVS) on for all SMs, thereby reducing switching losses. It also effectively reduces the loop resonant current, leading to lower conduction losses. The fixed-frequency control method simplifies the magnetic components design. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance under conditions of 9 to 18 kV input, 200 kW power, and 750 V output. Experimental results from a prototype further validate the feasibility and effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Torque Preservation in DFIG Systems During Voltage Dips With Modulated Stator-Connected Dynamic Braking Resistor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11162680</link><description>This article proposes a novel approach to enhancing the low-voltage ride-through capability of doubly-fed induction generator wind turbines using a dynamically modulated braking resistor (DBR) connected in series with the stator windings. Unlike conventional DBR-based methods that focus primarily on mitigating electrical transients, the proposed approach emphasizes maintaining the generator&#8217;s electromagnetic torque at its prefault level during grid voltage dips. The DBR resistance is calculated in real time based on analytical expressions derived from the system&#8217;s model. By properly selecting the DBR resistance during the fault, the excess mechanical power that cannot be transferred to the grid is dissipated within the resistor, allowing the generator torque to remain constant during the fault, which helps maintain rotor speed and mitigate electrical transients. The proposed strategy is validated through both simulation and experimental results under symmetrical fault conditions, demonstrating superior torque stability, reduced current transients, and improved postfault recovery compared to fixed-resistance DBR schemes.</description></item><item><title>Passivity-Based Zero-Sequence LC Resonance Suppression Method for Parallel Inverters System With Modified LCL Filter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11172354</link><description>Parallel inverters system with modified LCL filters may trigger zero-sequence LC (ZSLC) resonances. Especially in high-power applications, lower switching frequencies are usually adopted to reduce switching losses. In this situation, conventional inverter-side circulating current feedback (ICCF) control cannot behave as expected and introduces new stability issues due to high control delays. To deal with this situation, a passivity-based ZSLC resonance damping method is proposed. First, the equivalent admittance model of ICCF control is established for the first time, which is decomposed into passive component and active component. The results show that the system stability is determined by the active component and the inverter output admittance ratio. Second, by analyzing the frequency-domain characteristics of active components, it is found that the control delay introduces a negative conductance that affects the stability of the ICCF control. Accordingly, a controllable admittance component is added to correspondingly reshape the inverter output admittance characteristics under high control delay conditions, which can mitigate the detrimental impact of control delay in the active component. Thus, the proposed control strategy can enhance the system stability and the circulating resonance current can be effectively attenuated in high-power applications. Finally, the feasibility and correctness of the proposed scheme are verified by the experiments.</description></item><item><title>Weak Grid Characteristic Analysis and Operating Mode Selection for Voltage Support Enhancement of Wind Farms Connected to MMC-HVDC During Asymmetric Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11176120</link><description>The voltage support functions have been mandated in grid codes to help wind turbines (WTs) ride through ac faults. In a modular multilevel converter-based high voltage dc (MMC-HVDC) system for wind farm integration, particularly in scenarios where there is no conventional synchronous generator at the sending end, the MMC adopts voltage-frequency control to form an ac grid. Such grid, however, is found to have a distinctive weak characteristic, which significantly alters the relationship between the point of common coupling voltage and the current injected by WTs and makes existing voltage support modeling methods and control strategies for grid-connected inverters inapplicable to the WTs connected to MMC-HVDC. To enhance the voltage support performance for the WTs, this article aims to elaborate on the weak grid characteristic of the voltage formed by the MMC. To streamline the analysis, the concept of generalized fault impedance is first proposed to eliminate the need for numerous models built for scenarios with different network structures, negative sequence controls, fault types, and transformer winding configurations. Additionally, this article categorizes the operating modes of the MMC and utilizes the piecewise modeling method to derive precise control equations in each operating mode, based on which the weak grid characteristic is thoroughly discussed. Subsequently, to avoid globally identifying the optimal voltage support point, an operating mode selection method prior to the voltage support realization is proposed. Finally, the above modeling method and analysis are verified through control-hardware-in-the-loop experiments.</description></item><item><title>25 kW/L 99.2% Efficiency Wide Output Three Phase PFC Based on Modular Inductive Switching Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11184856</link><description>The modular inductive switching network (MISN) power factor correction (PFC) converter, featuring effective modularization and a single dc bus, is a promising solution for high efficiency ac&#8211;dc conversion with improved power density. However, when applied to battery charging systems requiring wide dc bus voltage range (e.g., 550&#8211;900 V), existing implementations face significant challenges that the loss and volume of the MISN module increase significantly. This study develops a mathematical model to analyze the impact of dc bus voltage on the MISN module, focusing on loss and volume. It is revealed that the MISN module&#8217;s operating voltage and buffer energy is proportional to the dc bus voltage range, leading to increased switching losses and capacitor volumes. To address these issues, a modified MISN-PFC converter with 3level LF-bridge is proposed, which has lower voltage stress of the MISN module. A 10 kW prototype demonstrates 99% full-load efficiency across the entire voltage range while achieving 25 kW/L power density, representing more than twice improvement in power density compared to conventional MISN-PFC converter with 2level LF-bridge under similar efficiency constraints.</description></item><item><title>Global-Synchronized Optimized Pulse Patterns</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11190002</link><description>Optimized pulse pattern, a powerful technique to address harmonic issues for power converters at low switching frequencies, has been widely recognized in high power applications in both industry and academia.

In this work, we propose a global-synchronized optimized pulse pattern technique for power converter clusters. As an upper-layer optimization strategy, the proposal utilizes the additional switching pattern freedom provided by the neighboring power converters and achieves extreme power quality at the common interface, even with ultra-low switching frequencies. Moreover, a pattern extension mechanism is designed to ensure sustained synchronization among units throughout the optimization interval, releasing the inherent computational challenge in the optimization problem. Experimental data confirm its effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Multiobjective Optimization for Dual Active Bridge Converter Under Variable-Frequency Single-Phase-Shift Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192665</link><description>The dual active bridge (DAB) converter serves as a dc transformer in high-power applications. Efficiency and power density are significant optimization objectives for DAB converters, influenced by factors such as modulation strategy, converter parameter, magnetic components design, etc. Variable-frequency (VF) single-phase-shift (SPS) modulation has been employed to improve light load efficiency, which is suitable in scenarios where the input and output bus voltages remain constant. However, under this modulation strategy, converter parameters and magnetic components have received little optimization. This article presents a multiobjective optimization method for DAB converter under VF SPS modulation. To ensure rated power and light-load zero-voltage-switching (ZVS), the design range of inductance and switching frequency is determined while considering nonidealities. Pareto optimization is applied for magnetic components design under the specific modulation strategy, balancing efficiency and power density. Finally, the switching frequency is optimized under different loads for high efficiency. A 6.4 kW DAB prototype is developed for experiment, verifying the multiobjective optimization is reasonable. Compared with traditional SPS modulation, the measured efficiency of optimized VF SPS modulation increases by 1.7% and 1.2% under full load and 20% load conditions, respectively, proving the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method.</description></item><item><title>Low Device Count Three-Port DC-DC Converter Integrating Onboard Charger and Auxiliary Power Module for Light Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11150744</link><description>Increasing the power rating of onboard chargers (OBCs) and auxiliary power modules (APMs) is constrained by cost and size. Integrating OBC with APM mitigates these challenges. This article proposes a converter integrating OBC and APM using minimum active switches. The proposed integrated power converter (IPC) comprises two transformers and three bridge converters connected to dc-link of frontend rectifier, high voltage (HV) traction battery, and low voltage (LV) auxiliary battery. During OBC operation, simultaneous power transfer to HV and LV batteries leads to current cancellation, reducing rms current in one of the bridge legs common for both power flow paths. Current cancellation and converter power loss depend upon IPC design parameters, which are turns ratio and leakage inductances of two transformers. This article introduces three design approaches and compares IPC performance with these approaches analytically and experimentally. In addition, a control strategy is suggested to ensure desired power flow across different power paths. A laboratory-developed prototype integrating 1 kW OBC and 350 W APM for a light electric vehicle is fabricated to validate IPC performance with three design approaches. In addition to reduced device count, proposed IPC achieves 0.7 % improvement in efficiency compared to its nonintegrated version with similar circuit configuration.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Flexible Power Control for Three-Phase Buck Rectifier Under Unbalanced Grid Voltages and Wide Grid Frequency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153897</link><description>For the three-phase pulsewidth modulation rectifiers under unbalanced grid voltages, flexible power control is often utilized to realize multiple control objectives, e.g., constant active power control, constant reactive power control, or balanced input currents control. However, in more electric aircraft application, it is difficult to apply flexible power control because of its wide variation of grid frequency from 360 Hz to 800 Hz. In this article, a novel flexible power control is proposed for the three-phase buck rectifier under unbalanced grid voltages and wide grid frequency. The input current references are constructed by detecting the amplitudes of the grid voltages in the &#945;&#946; frame. In addition, a parameter is adjusted to regulate the oscillating power between active power and reactive power to achieve flexible power control. The proposed control strategy can be implemented without phase-lock loop. It is thus suitable for the application under wide variation of grid frequency. Simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Design of a High Performance Flying Capacitor Multilevel Inverter for Electric Vehicles With Stacked Printed Circuit Boards</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11160666</link><description>Drivetrain efficiency and weight represent significant barriers toward the development of future electric aircraft.

A slot-pole interaction analysis model is developed, incorporating nonlinear magnetic permeability modulation effects, to elucidate the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of electromagnetic forces and their resonance mechanisms with structural modes. A novel energy-based method for cogging torque calculation is introduced, achieving a 20% improvement in computational efficiency while maintaining numerical errors below 2% . Furthermore, a cylindrical shell vibration model based on nodal force mapping and a boundary element-based acoustic radiation prediction framework are established. Multiobjective optimization leveraging response surface methodology and a modified particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed to quantify the impact of temperature gradients on permanent magnet performance and nonlinear synergistic effects among parameters.

Conventional control methods, such as proportional-integral regulator, are widely used due to their simple structure and straightforward principles. However, these approaches heavily depend on the model accuracy, which may lead to suboptimal performance in the presence of parameter mismatches and disturbances. To overcome this limitation, this article proposes a comprehensive control framework for voltage closed-loop regulation and introduces an ultralocal model-free pulse-frequency modulation (UMF-PFM) approach. In this framework, the frequency and output voltage are used as variables in frequency modulation. This enables the identification of the unknown nonlinear term of the system, which encapsulates all relevant structural information. By adjusting the frequency, the controller&#8217;s performance remains robust, reducing its dependence on model accuracy. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that, the UMF-PFM shows better stability against parameter mismatches and perturbations on the primary side of the dc&#8211;dc converter compared to existing PFM and PSM methods, which are affected by less than 1 V of the output voltage under the same conditions.</description></item><item><title>A Novel 36-Pulse Rectifier With a Delta-Configured Pulse-Doubler Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11152627</link><description>To enhance the harmonic suppression capability of the traditional 18-pulse rectifier, a delta-configured pulse-doubler circuit (DC-PDC) is proposed, and a new 36-pulse rectifier with DC-PDC is presented in this article. The DC-PDC consists of three dual-tapped converters and is installed on the dc side of the rectifier. The positive output terminals of three rectifier bridges serve as the input to the DC-PDC, and the output of the DC-PDC is connected to the load to supply power. The unique structure and connection method of the DC-PDC enable six auxiliary diodes to conduct cyclically, thereby increasing the output states of the rectifier bridges. This effect, in turn, increases the pulse number of the rectifier from 18 to 36, reducing the total harmonic distortion of the input current from 7.1% to 2.4% .

Stability analysis methods based on impedance modeling offer a theoretical framework to analyze and address this issue. However, under conditions of uncertainty regarding the internal structure and parameters of VSCs, existing impedance measurement techniques using frequency scanning are limited in terms of data acquisition and accuracy. In practice, the power output demand for VSCs in grid-connected operation tends to vary, making it challenging for frequency scanning schemes to account for changes in operating conditions. To address this challenge, this article proposes a sequence impedance prediction solution based on a bidirectional long short-term memory method, which requires only limited data to accomplish high-precision prediction of the overall impedance of VSCs under multiple operating points. Unlike the existing $dq$-based impedance prediction schemes, the sequence impedance method will greatly simplify the prediction process, and the physical meaning is clear. In addition, this article applies trained model to a small-scale VSC model through transfer learning for experimental validation. The process saves computational resources while maintaining prediction accuracy and demonstrates the adaptability of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Single-Stage Multiport Solid-State Transformer Based Medium-Voltage DC Interconnection System and Coordinated Control Strategies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11162697</link><description>Decentralized integration of distributed generation (DG) units and loads are increasing in the modern distribution grid.

However, the subsequent circulating currents generated by the common-dc-link and asynchronous carriers can lead to excessive harmonic distortion and power losses. To solve this issue, a multiobjective optimization based pulse-width modulation (MOOPWM) scheme is proposed in this article. First, a multiconstraint vector preselection criterion is developed to reconcile the targets such as eliminating circulating currents, diminishing common-mode voltage (CMV) amplitude, and executing the nearest equilateral/isosceles vector synthesis.

However, conventional MPC, which obtains the optimal control input by evaluating all the discrete switching states, experiences excessive port power ripples and a complex weighting factor tuning process. To this end, this article proposes a hybrid predictive control (HPC) with linear power distribution for the SSMPI to reduce power ripples of dc ports and eliminate weighting factors. In the proposed HPC, the stator current regulation of the motor is realized through tracking error minimization by considering the SSMPI as a single-source inverter, where the iteration time of the MPC can be sharply reduced. Besides, the power distribution of the dc sources is achieved by precisely splitting the predicted optimal voltage vector in the subinverters of SSMPI, and the dc port power distribution ripples can be significantly reduced through linear comparison of the predicted boundary powers. Moreover, the complex weighting factor tuning process is also eliminated due to the decoupled control structure in HPC.

Passivity theory is recognized as a promising solution to this challenge, as it simplifies the large-signal stability analysis of dc microgrids by decomposing it into the passivity analysis of individual converters. The interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) approach, widely adopted based on the port-controlled hamiltonian (PCH) model, ensures that converters exhibit passivity in a closed-loop configuration. However, existing IDA-PBC methods fail to achieve input&#8211;output port passivity, preventing system-level large-signal stability due to unmodeled electrical interconnections and subsystem interactions. Additionally, these methods introduce singularities at equilibrium points because the PCH model structure is altered when deriving the unique mathematical expression for the duty cycle. This article proposes an IDA-PBC approach based on reference modification to address these issues. This controller accounts for electrical input variations within the closed-loop PCH model to achieve input-to-output port passivity. Furthermore, the reference for the converters is reconstructed to derive a unique duty cycle expression without altering the closed-loop PCH model, thereby avoiding singularities at equilibrium points. Finally, the system-level large-signal stability of the proposed control is validated through experiments.</description></item><item><title>3-D Negative-Sequence Current Reconstruction Method for DC Bus Voltage Ripple Suppression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003273</link><description>The negative-sequence components in the unbalanced grid will lead to the dc bus voltage ripple, as well as the grid current harmonics.

The data-driven control strategy eschews the need for system dynamics, instead leveraging the experimental data to get efficient and relevant solutions. More specifically, the three-phase ac&#8211;dc power converter in this article is conceptualized as a class of discrete-time switched affine systems with time-varying affine terms. This methodology guarantees the convergence of the system state to a limit cycle, which is determined according to criteria of interest related to the steady-state behavior of the system trajectories, for instance, the angular frequency of the three-phase alternating current, the sampling period and the desired output voltage. Based on a switching multi-hifted-point-dependent Lyapunov function, sufficient conditions of experimental data dependence are derived to guarantee the state trajectories converge to a desired limit cycle. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is validated through an experimental verification of a three-phase ac&#8211;dc power converter.</description></item><item><title>A Method for Detecting and Localizing Open-Circuit Switch Faults in MMCs Using Separable Conv2D Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10990201</link><description>Open-circuit switch faults in submodules (SMs) of modular multilevel converters (MMCs) pose a significant challenge to system reliability and continuous operation. This article proposes a fault detection and localization (FDL) method that utilizes a neural network based on SeparableConv2D with a dataset generated from three-phase circulating currents and SM capacitor voltages. Considering the crucial role of controllers in MMCs and their influence on signal behavior during normal and fault conditions, a comprehensive control framework is employed in two operational modes: grid-connected and RL load-connected. This also ensures that the FDL method remains independent of the modulation scheme. This article considers faults even when the faulty switch is outside the arm&#8217;s current path. Preprocessing techniques, such as K-nearest neighbors (KNNs) imputation, quantile transformation, and sliding time window (STW), are used to prepare the data for optimal neural network input. Model optimization uses the AdamW algorithm, with learning rates dynamically adjusted via the ReduceLROnPlateau method. This approach minimizes computational complexity by requiring only one training session while leveraging optimized network architecture and preprocessing techniques to enhance FDL speed and accuracy. Finally, simulation and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>An RL-Based Strategy for Optimal Power and Gas Flow Calculation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945737</link><description>Operating the integrated power and gas systems necessitates solving optimal power and gas flow (OPGF) problem, which is notably challenging due to the inherent nonlinearity and complexity of both systems. This study introduces a novel approach to address the OPGF problem by integrating problem decomposition with reinforcement learning (RL)-based cutting plane techniques. The proposed strategy divides the original OPGF problem into a simplified OPGF (SOPGF) sub-problem and a power and gas flow (PGF) calculation sub-problem. In the constraint set of the SOPGF sub-problem, linear inequality constraints (i.e., cutting planes or cuts) are introduced, bounding the feasible region of the SOPGF sub-problem and thereby obtaining the optimal solution to the original OPGF problem. The cuts are determined using an RL algorithm, and the RL agent is trained to maximize the rewards estimated by the PGF calculation. To enhance the efficiency of the agent training, action selection method is utilized in the RL-based cutting plane approach. Case studies are performed to assess the proposed strategy in comparison to conventional methods across diverse test conditions, verifying that the new approach surpasses conventional approaches in both computational efficiency and feasibility.</description></item><item><title>Modelling of AC-DC Voltage Control Coupling and Adaptive Fault Ride-Through Method for VSC-HVDC Integrated Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948156</link><description>During grid fault, the voltage source converter-based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) integrated wind farms should effectively support the grid voltage while ensuring the integrated system security. Existing studies have neglected the AC-DC voltage control coupling caused by the sudden change in the grid's complex impedance due to the fault transition impedance, which may lead to transient DC overvoltage, poor elevation of grid voltage, or active power loss of wind farms. A faulted grid equivalent model based on the virtual fault is established, and the mechanism of AC-DC voltage control coupling of the integrated system caused by the complex impedance of the faulted grid is found. A coupling model of the grid-connection bus voltage of the integrated system, maximum DC voltage deviation, and active power of the wind-end converter is established, and the quantification method for the maximum grid voltage support capability of the integrated system is proposed. Finally, the adaptive symmetrical fault ride-through method balancing between AC-DC voltage control is proposed. Through simulation verification, the proposed method can maximize the grid voltage elevation and minimize the active power loss of wind farms while avoiding DC overvoltage and the steady-state AC overcurrent of grid-end converter under the premise.</description></item><item><title>Performance-Aware Control of Modular Batteries for Fast Frequency Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947730</link><description>Modular batteries can be aggregated to deliver frequency regulation services for power grids. Although utilizing the idle capacity of battery modules is financially attractive, it remains challenging to consider the heterogeneous module-level characteristics such as dynamic operational efficiencies and battery degradation. In addition, real-time decision making within seconds is required to enable fast frequency response. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a performance-aware scheduling approach for battery modules to deliver fast frequency response (FFR) support. In particular, the conduction loss and switching loss of battery packs as well as converters are captured within a mix-integer quadratic constrained program (MIQCP). The cycle-based aging model identifies the aging cost of battery modules during frequent cycling by introducing the aging subgradient calculation and linearization. Case studies based on real-world battery data show that the proposed scheduling approach can effectively reduce power loss cost by nearly 28%&#8211;57% and battery aging cost by 4%-15% compared to conventional methods, which can also enhance the SoC balance.</description></item><item><title>Meta Reinforcement Learning Based Adaptive and Interpretable Energy Storage Control Meets Dynamic Scenarios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948374</link><description>As renewable energy becomes more widespread, energy storage systems (ESSs) play an important role in managing energy distribution and economic arbitrage. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduling methods face performance degradation or failure in highly dynamic environments due to their limited generalization capability, especially amid increasing fluctuations in renewable energy output, electricity prices, and load demands. This paper proposes a novel ESSs control framework based on Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL), comprising offline training and online adaptation phases. The offline training phase features a dual-loop update framework, acquiring a model with highly generalizable initial parameters through a multi-task learning approach. In the online adaptation phase, the model can make adaptive adjustments rapidly in response to environmental changes. Lastly, a Shapley Value-based Meta-RL (SMRL) method is proposed to perform an in-depth analysis of decision-making outcomes. Multiple dynamic microgrid (MG) scenarios were simulated using real data with added fluctuation factors for model training and testing. The proposed Meta-RL based model exhibits significantly better adaptability in various scenarios, achieving approximately 20% to 50% performance improvement compared to the traditional RL model. A detailed analysis of the contribution of features behind scheduling decisions shows alignment with human intuition.</description></item><item><title>Periodic-Enhanced Informer Model for Short-Term Wind Power Forecasting Using SCADA Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955286</link><description>Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems can collect abundant information about wind farm operation and environment. To better make use of SCADA data, a periodic-enhanced informer model for short-term wind power forecasting using scada data is proposed. Firstly, to effectively filter out noise in SCADA data, a v-p curve-based method is adopted by incorporating a quartile approach to remove sparse outliers; a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is then employed to eliminate stacked outliers from the power curve. Secondly, a multi-feature input set selection method based on Maximization Information Coefficient is introduced to make better use of the SCADA system data by reducing the number of features. Thirdly, a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is designed to extract the scalar projection of the input set, followed by fusing the local time stamp and global time stamp to build the periodic information enhanced prediction model embedding layer. Subsequently, the enhanced input set is fed into an informer model to predict future wind power. Finally, considering the multiple temporal scales structure characteristics present in the dataset, a multi-scale deep fusion module is established in the informer model to deeply integrate the features of different scales. It can simultaneously avoid the resource waste and overfitting problems caused by increasing the network depth. The experimental results, which are obtained from several deep learning methods on real SCADA data, demonstrate that the suggested approach has good predictive capability.</description></item><item><title>Computationally Efficient Model Predictive Control for Enhanced Primary-Level Management of Standalone Microgrids With Hybrid Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955859</link><description>This paper proposes a highly efficient model predictive control (MPC) technique for primary-level control of a hybrid storage system (HSS) in a microgrid with renewables. Generally, active set (AS)-based MPCs are used to control HSS-based microgrid systems, which are computationally complex. The high-complexity prevents making control decisions within the sampling time, which negatively affects the robustness of the control system. Moreover, high complexity necessitates powerful controllers, which increase the system's overall cost and energy consumption. On the other hand, less complex controls, such as supervisory control, reduce the storage system's stability, reliability, and lifetime. The proposed method is a closed-form AS-based MPC that shares the mutual advantages of both AS-based MPC and supervisory controllers with additional robustness. It thus significantly reduces the computational complexity while being stable and reliable, improving storage lifetime, and having higher robustness compared to MPC and supervisory controllers. The proposed method is compared to modified AS based MPC, Hildreth quadratic programming (HQP), and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) based MPC recently employed for an HSS microgrid application. The analysis showed that the proposed method could significantly outperform the conventional MPC methods in computational complexity and robustness, as well as the supervisory controller in terms of reliability, stability, enhanced battery lifetime, and robustness.</description></item><item><title>Analysis of a Disturbance Event With Inverter-Based Resources Using EMT Simulations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964428</link><description>Increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) necessitates newer methods of planning and analysis of disturbances. The existing phasor-domain transient stability (TS) analysis may not capture the dynamics of IBRs during fault events. In this paper, electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations using high-fidelity detailed model of power grid and one of the affected photovoltaic (PV) plants during the Angeles Forest disturbance in 2018 are performed. In these simulations, the processes to develop EMT models of power grid from traditional phasor-domain TS data and PV plant from collected data are described. Thereafter, using these simulations, the response of the PV plant during the fault event in 2018 is replicated and a sensitivity analysis is performed. The sensitivity analysis consists of making changes to the components within the PV plant and in the power grid to evaluate the impact they have on the response observed by the PV plant during the fault event. This analysis provides an understanding of the components that impact the operation of a PV plant during fault events and provide guidance to system planners on the studies that need to be performed to maintain a reliable power grid as new IBR plants are integrated.</description></item><item><title>Categorical Spatial Interpolation of Solar Irradiance for Regional Distributed Photovoltaic Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964342</link><description>High-spatial-resolution (HSR) solar irradiance forecast data is important for regional distributed photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting. Distributed PV sites are widely geographically distributed and the cost of obtaining HSR irradiance forecast data with full regional coverage is very high. Improving spatial resolution through interpolation based on limited sparse irradiance forecast reference points is a low-cost and feasible approach. However, existing irradiance spatial interpolation methods would produce large errors under variable weather conditions (e.g., cloudy) with limited reference points, because local abrupt changes in irradiance usually occur under such weather conditions due to cloud movement. This paper proposes a categorical spatial interpolation method to improve the accuracy of distributed PV power forecasting with limited sparse irradiance forecast data. The method first converts satellite-derived shortwave radiation images into binary irradiance maps through adaptive thresholding, then trains a 3D U-net model to predict future irradiance category probabilities for each grid. These probability maps dynamically govern two parallel interpolation processes: one using reference stations in predicted clear-sky regions, another utilizing stations in cloudy zones, with final irradiance values determined by probability-weighted fusion. Case studies on a real dataset verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Centralized Control for Paralleled VSCs With Grid-Forming and Oscillation Suppression Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965541</link><description>Paralleled multiple voltage source converters (VSCs) are adopted in photovoltaic (PV) or energy storage systems, and may suffer from oscillation and fault disturbance issues under various grid conditions. In this paper, a centralized control frame is proposed to suppress the active power oscillation and support the grid voltage/frequency via grid-forming (GFM) control. A virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control is applied as the centralized controller, which communicates with local controllers. The mutual damping and power angle feedback are adopted in the local controller to achieve an accurate active power sharing. The influence of key parameters such as the communication delay and mutual damping are analyzed. Finally, the proposed control is verified though the simulation and hierarchical controller-hardware-in-loop (CHIL) experiments.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Pseudo-Decentralized Control of Wave Energy Arrays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965503</link><description>In control of wave energy converter (WEC) arrays, since the dynamics of different devices are coupled by radiation effects, there has always been a dilemma between using centralized control, with optimal energy production but usually overwhelming computation, or decentralized control, with acceptable computation but performance degradation. This paper proposes a pseudo-decentralized control strategy that is effective in energy production but efficient in computation. In this method, a centralized estimation-forecasting scheme is applied to provide global information on the wave excitation force (WEF) experienced by each device. Then, the optimal unconstrained array motion is calculated from the WEF information, to serve as an initial guess of the optimal constrained motion. Finally, the constrained control moves of each WEC are optimized decentralizedly using model predictive control (MPC). However, in contrast to conventional decentralized control, each local controller not only maximizes its own energy production, but also takes into account the energy it contributes, through radiation, to other WECs, given their anticipated motion. In this way, the proposed controller enjoys the same computational simplicity as decentralized control, but is demonstrated, through comprehensive testing, to be capable of achieving performance close to the ideal centralized control across a wide range of sea states.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Energy Storage Configuration for Primary Frequency Regulation Performance Considering State of Charge Partitioning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965852</link><description>The proportion of renewable energy in the power system continues to rise, and its intermittent and uncertain output has had a certain impact on the frequency stability of the grid. Therefore, a multi-type energy storage (ES) configuration method considering State of Charge (SOC) partitioning and frequency regulation performance matching is proposed for primary frequency regulation. Firstly, the Automatic Generation Control (AGC) signal is decomposed and reconstructed using the variational mode decomposition (VMD) method. Specifically, by combining the charge and discharge characteristics of Li-ion battery and flywheel energy storage (FES), component signals of different frequencies are allocated to different ES systems. Secondly, a multi-type ES capacity allocation optimization model considering SOC partitioning is developed, with the objective function being the minimization of the whole life-cycle planning cost of ES. Finally, based on actual data from a region in North China, the proposed method is verified by analyzing case studies under different scenarios. The results demonstrate that the method can effectively reduce computation time, optimize ES operating conditions, and thus lower the whole life-cycle planning cost of ES.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Grid-Interactive Power Performance Enhancement Method for D-PMSG-Based Virtual Synchronous Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966203</link><description>Virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control is widely applied in grid-interactive inverters due to its similarity to synchronous generators. The VSG frequency variation is delayed by the synchronous swing equation to provide additional inertia support, which also leads to a slower power response. When applied to wind turbines (WTs), VSG reduces their power tracking ability, compromises the wind power capture efficiency, and affects the dispatch commands execution. The response to external frequency causes more power changes in WTs, making it difficult for wind power capture to keep up due to the mass of the rotor and blades, bring extra operational risks for WTs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hierarchical grid-interactive power performance enhancement method for D-PMSG-based virtual synchronous wind turbines (VSWTs). The power performance is enhanced by coordinating the synchronous swing equation and voltage excitation equation parameters. The grid-forming power flow and electromechanical status of the VSWT are integrated to extend the kinetic energy (KE) utilization limits to ensure the efficiency and safety of the VSWT during the KE utilization-based wind power capture regulation. The proposed method comprehensively improves the grid-interactive power performance of VSWTs, and the effectiveness has been validated through comparative simulations.</description></item><item><title>Novel Voltage Support Strategies for DGs in Hybrid AC/DC Distribution Networks Under Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10970419</link><description>According to the grid codes, the higher the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC), the longer duration that the voltage-source converters (VSC) can stay connected to the grid. In hybrid AC/DC distribution networks (HADNs), owing to the low capacity, VSC-based distributed generator (DG) closest to the fault point may fail to significantly support the voltage at the PCC through current injection. Therefore, other large-capacity converters such as flexible AC/DC converters (FACs) should also inject currents to help it. However, in resistive-inductive HADNs, the voltage support effect is related to the current phases of converters, and the fault conditions. In this paper, circumstances under two fault position categories (upstream and downstream fault positions of DG) for double line-to-ground fault and three-phase short-circuit fault are analyzed. The interconnected sequence networks of HADNs under these two fault positions are proposed. Based on the proposed networks, the optimal current phase angles of DG and FAC for maximumly supporting voltages at the PCC of the DG are proposed. Moreover, the line sequence impedance calculation method is proposed. The simulation results verify the proposed strategy. The proposed strategy is suitable for low-capacity DGs in resistive-inductive HADNs to achieve voltage support and fault ride-through.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Accelerated ADMM for Stochastic Power System Scheduling With Numerous Scenarios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10971244</link><description>The increasing share of uncertain renewable energy sources (RES) in power systems necessitates new efficient approaches for the two-stage stochastic multi-period AC optimal power flow (St-MP-OPF) optimization. The computational complexity of St-MP-OPF, particularly with AC constraints, grows exponentially with the number of uncertainty scenarios and the time horizon. This complexity poses significant challenges for large-scale transmission systems that require numerous scenarios to capture RES stochasticities. This paper introduces a scenario-based decomposition of theSt-MP-OPF based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Additionally, this paper proposes a machine learning-accelerated ADMM approach (ADMM-ML), facilitating rapid and parallel computations of numerous scenarios with extended time horizons. Within this approach, a recurrent neural network approximates the ADMM sub-problem optimization and predicts wait-and-see decisions for uncertainty scenarios, while a master optimization determines here-and-now decisions. Additionally, we develop a hybrid approach that uses ML predictions to warm-start the ADMM algorithm, combining the computational efficiency of ML with the feasibility and optimality guarantees of optimization methods. The numerical results on the 118-bus and 1354-bus system show that the proposed ADMM-ML approach solves the St-MP-OPF with 3-4 orders of magnitude speed-ups, while the hybrid approach provides a balance between speed-ups and optimality.</description></item><item><title>Finite-Time Stabilization of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines Under Wind and Wave Disturbances by Adaptive Barrier-Function Fractional-Order Sliding Mode Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10972122</link><description>Floating offshore wind turbines harness more vigorous and more stable winds, making them a promising solution for clean energy. However, their stability is compromised by sea waves and sudden winds, reducing power extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a finite-time fractional-order adaptive SMC for tension-leg platform wind turbines to enhance stability and efficiency. A fractional-order model ensures accurate system representation, while a barrier-function-based adaptive control strategy guarantees rapid, finite-time convergence, mitigates chattering, and suppresses external disturbances through real-time estimation. The proposed controller effectively stabilizes the system, helping to maximize power extraction. Simulation results in the MATLAB-Simulink environment demonstrate superior performance compared to conventional methods in terms of disturbance rejection and convergence speed. Furthermore, hardware-in-the-loop validation using a Speedgoat platform confirms the method's real-time feasibility and robustness under realistic operational conditions. The proposed approach offers a significant advancement in floating offshore wind turbines stability and control, ensuring efficient energy harvesting even under severe environmental disturbances. These findings contribute to the development of more reliable and resilient floating wind energy systems, supporting the transition toward sustainable offshore wind power.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Dispatch of Bi-Directional Power and Hydrogen Systems for Enhancing the Renewable Energy Integration in Grid-Connected Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10977964</link><description>The accelerating transition to renewable-based power grids is critical for carbon neutrality. Centralized renewable energy deployment usually forms grid-connected microgrids with limited power exchange with the main grid for stability concerns, which results in inadequate utilization of renewable energy. With hydrogen becoming an indispensable energy component, power-to-hydrogen (P2H) technology has become increasingly prevalent for mitigating renewable energy curtailments. In this paper, we present a coordinated dispatch model for bi-directional power-hydrogen system (BDPHS) that considers the electrolyzer dynamics for hydrogen storage and hydrogen fuel cell systems.

However, most existing methods face challenges in dealing with data scarcity and random fluctuations. This paper proposes an ultra-short-term distributed PV power forecasting method based on Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Firstly, virtual distributed PV power data is generated with different spatial resolutions. Next, the generated data is used to pre-train a Transformer-based model for predicting PV power from 15 minutes to 4 hours. Finally, the model is fine-tuned on real PV stations with a small data volume. The attention mechanism can learn correlations from lots of historical power data by pre-training. Fine-tuning can realize lightweight deployment and accurate prediction on newly built PV stations, effectively dealing with data scarcity. Models with 12.63M and 103M parameters are pre-trained using virtual data, respectively. The experimental results on datasets from 3 locations show that when there is 1 mo real data, the average RMSE decreases by 37.22%, 32.92% and 10.87% compared with the LSTM, linear model, and Transformer-based model, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Allocation and Two-Level Control of Reactive Power for Balancing Voltage and Power Factor of Renewable Energy Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980477</link><description>Renewable energy stations(RES) must satisfy voltage security and power factor requirements for safe and efficient operation. However, these requirements often conflict, posing challenges in practical applications. This paper first analyzes the constraints and identifies the boundary of RES voltage regulation capability under power factor constraints. Building on the analysis, an optimal allocation and two-level control (TLC) of reactive power is proposed. It integrates the optimization of reactive power compensator (RPC) with the coordinated control of reactive resources, thereby balancing voltage regulation and power factor. From the allocation perspective, an RPC optimization method is proposed to maximize the feasible voltage range of RES under varying active power conditions of RES. From the control perspective, a TLC scheme is proposed, combining station and unit control. At the station level, the controller features a mode-switching function and calculates the overall reactive power reference value. At the unit level, the controller coordinates the converter-interfaced generations (CIGs) and RPC. Case studies are conducted on a real RES project in Bazhou, Xinjiang, China. Matlab/Simulink and Opal-RT real-time simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances both voltage security and economic efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Autonomous Voltage Regulation for Smart Distribution Network With High-Proportion PVs:A Graph Meta-Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982124</link><description>Smart distribution grids with a high percentage of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems often face severe voltage quality problems. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) presents great potentials in achieving optimal voltage level control in distribution grids with the advantage of learning without explicit modeling. However, when DRL is applied to active voltage regulation in distribution grids with a high proportion of distributed photovoltaic (PV) power generation, it encounters several challenges, such as uneven learning among controllable devices and environmental instability, which impede the convergence of DRL. In addition, traditional reinforcement learning represents the distribution network with vectors and ignores topology information. In this paper, we transform the voltage control problem into a partially observable Markov decision process, and propose a multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning algorithm based on graph convolutional networks to improve voltage quality by combining DRL with meta-learning (ML). By integrating ML, our approach allows agents to better predict the actions of other agents, thus mitigating the instability of the environment. To address the problem of uneven learning among agents, we incorporate a self-concern mechanism and a value decomposition method into the critique network. The proposed algorithm is validated through experiments on IEEE 33-bus, 141-bus, and 322-bus systems and compared with five other multi-agent DRL methods and model-based model predictive control algorithms.</description></item><item><title>FDCA-DSTGCN: A Wind Farm Cluster Power Day-Ahead Prediction Model Based on Frequency Domain Information Gain and Dynamic Trend Sensing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982214</link><description>Accurate wind farm cluster power prediction (WFCPP) is of vital significance for new power systems with large-scale wind power integration. The current WFCPP modeling method ignores the important role of wind direction and frequency domain information, resulting in insufficient use of spatial information and difficult to improve the prediction accuracy. In order to solve the above problems, a day-ahead power prediction model for wind farm cluster power is proposed based on information gain in frequency domain and dynamic trend sensing. Firstly, a cluster division method based on graph theory and progressive fusion of multiple information is proposed, and a virtual information node is set up.

Finally, the proposed method is applied to a wind farm cluster in Inner Mongolia of China. Compared with the existing and traditional prediction methods, the normalized root mean square error of the proposed method is reduced by 1.13%&#8211;2.15%, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Assessing the Impact and Quantifying the Value of Flexibility in Transactive Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10989551</link><description>Distributed Flexibility (DF) is seen as a key tool in managing future distribution networks, but there are no comprehensive methods to quantify its value to stakeholders and impact on the network. Consequently, the potential costs and benefits of DF are uncertain, delaying the rollout of the concept onto real networks. This paper proposes a method to address that gap: a network-aware framework for modelling the interaction of DF with local and whole system markets to analyse the system performance in detail. The paper provides a set of mathematical models and algorithms to derive realistic supply and demand curves for flexibility in a distribution system, find the global equilibrium of multiple markets and services, model their impacts on networks, and perform cost-benefit analysis for stakeholders. The framework has been applied to a case study comprising a real network in England, forecast data of flexible demand and distributed generation, and the prices expected in the electricity system. The numerical study showed that DF can bring real value to all stakeholders when procured through markets; however, to maintain positive and consistent benefits to networks and stakeholders, appropriate price signals (i.e., tariffs and charges) must be designed for each network individually.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Control of Grid-Forming Wind Turbines and Grid-Forming Energy Storage Systems for Power System Restoration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002600</link><description>Grid-forming wind turbines (GFM-WTs) provide a promising solution for the restoration of wind-integrated power systems owing to their fast restart and grid support capabilities. However, individual GFM-WTs rely on external GFM sources for self-start, and their GFM support capability may be hindered by wind power shortages, potentially causing restoration failures. To address these challenges, this paper combines GFM-WTs and GFM energy storage systems (ESSs) to construct a black-start source for power system restoration. The GFM-ESS can provide self-start conditions for the GFM-WT while also improving its GFM support capability to withstand wind power shortages and load restoration transients. To ensure the stability of the restored system, a coordinated control strategy is proposed. First, a pre-synchronization control is designed to enable the GFM-WT to seamlessly connect with the GFM-ESS. Second, a power system stabilizer is developed to mitigate the power oscillation between the parallel GFM-WT and GFM-ESS. Third, to coordinate their power outputs during the load restoration, a model predictive secondary frequency control considering the stability of the WT rotor speed and system frequency is presented. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can improve the stability and security of the system restoration process under wind power shortages.</description></item><item><title>Rotor Thrust Control for Large-Scale Wind Turbine in Near-Rated Wind Speed Region</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003805</link><description>To limit the maximum rotor thrust in the near-rated wind speed region, this paper proposes a novel rotor thrust control scheme for large-scale wind turbines operating. It contains a rotor thrust identificator, a rotor thrust control loop, and a feedforward blade pitch controller. A simplified blade model is first proposed to achieve rotor thrust identification. Based on blade element momentum theory, the rotor thrust can be identified by the blade root out-of-plane bending moments. The rotor thrust control loop is then designed with the identified rotor thrust. Then, a feedforward blade pitch saturator is designed, called Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion based minimum Pitch Saturator (NDI-PS). It is realized by nonlinear dynamic inversion of the thrust coefficient curve. The simulation results exhibit outstanding performance of the proposed control scheme. Compared with existing controllers of NREL and Goldwind, power output is increased by 1% to 1.5%, while blade root and tower bottom loads are mitigated by about 4% .</description></item><item><title>Feature-Driven Microgrid Economic Dispatch via Solar-Induced Contingent Balancing Satisficing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11005474</link><description>For the multiple energy microgrid (MEMG), this paper builds an adaptive Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity set instead of characterizing its size for solving the economic dispatch (ED) problem considering uncertain solar outputs. With the ambiguity set, an electrothermal balancing satisficing (EBS) framework is proposed by defining a solar-induced contingent electrothermal balancing risk measure (SCEB-RM) to interpret the risk level for maintaining electrothermal balance under solar uncertainty. For comprehensive contingent cost targets, a multi-objective EBS is extended to refine the solar impact on electric and thermal energy resources, respectively, and provide the corresponding out-of-sample cost bounds. Using the realized solar data, a feature-driven EBS model is formulated by incorporating soft dynamic time warping-based k-means clustering into the ambiguity. A tractable counterpart is obtained by developing a solution approach on bilateral responsive affine resource adaptation, where satisfactory targets are specified by comparing with sample robust optimization as the baseline, serving as an instance. Using real-world datasets, combinations of IEEE test systems and thermal networks validate that EBS eliminates the risky condition of uncertainty while revealing the connection between targets and solutions. It is shown that cluster-wise information makes EBS withstand greater uncertainty as effectively as the state-of-the-art in most cases and sometimes better.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Mean-Corrected Recursive Estimation-Based Optimal DER Dispatch for Distribution System Voltage Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11004617</link><description>Recent advances in smart inverters offer opportunities to mitigate adverse grid impacts caused by high penetrations of distributed photovoltaics (PV) in distribution grids, such as voltage violations. This paper proposes a novel measurement-driven optimal power flow (OPF)-based distributed energy resource management system (DERMS) voltage regulation via recursive sensitivity estimation informed coordinated control of distributed PV inverters. The proposed approach leverages available grid and controllable DER measurements, eliminating reliance on system model information while being adaptive and robust to volatile operating conditions. A mean-corrected recursive ridge regression (MCRRR) algorithm is proposed for sensitivity estimation, continuously refining the sensitivity model through a closed-form solution. It effectively manages varying grid operating conditions, such as changes in power injections and topology reconfiguration, to facilitate a time-varying update of the Load Sensitivity Factors (LSF). The proposed approach is formulated as a linear programming (LP) problem and is thus scalable to larger-scale distribution systems. Its effectiveness and efficiency are demonstrated on a realistic distribution feeder with high PV penetrations in Southern California, USA</description></item><item><title>Voltage and Frequency Stability Constrained Unit Commitment for Power Systems With Heterogeneous Regulation Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11005481</link><description>The growing integration of converter-based renewable energy sources (RESs) and the retirement of conventional units are pushing modern power systems closer to their stability limits. Imposing stability constraints in scheduling models is crucial to maintaining secure operations. This paper develops a novel voltage and frequency stability constrained unit commitment (UC) model for power systems with heterogeneous regulation resources, including synchronous generators (SGs), synchronous condensers, condenser retrofitted SGs, and wind power generators with grid-following or grid-forming converters. The frequency stability constraints encompass critical metrics across the entire frequency response process, effectively capturing the unique dynamics of diverse resources. The voltage stability constraints prioritize the long-term stability of buses with low stability margins, particularly those heavily penetrated by RESs. Furthermore, the proposed model captures the inherent coupling between frequency and voltage stability, offering extensibility for broader applications. To ensure computational efficiency, nonlinear terms in the constraints are linearized using a piecewise linearization algorithm. The proposed two-stage UC model optimizes operational costs while maintaining system stability. Case studies on the modified IEEE 9-bus system and the IEEE RTS-79 system validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Damping Evaluation Method of the Power Systems Integrated With Wind Farms During the Sub-Synchronous Control Interaction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11005697</link><description>This paper proposes a distributed damping evaluation method (DDEM) to assess the damping distribution0 in doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farms during sub-synchronous control interactions (SSCI). The proposed DDEM identifies sensitive control parameters of the DFIG wind turbines at oscillatory frequencies through the explicit expression of the system's damping loss factor (DLF). It also evaluates the damping contribution by calculating the distributed damping loss factor (DDLF) for each element or subsystem in real-time. Initially, this paper presents the DLF concept for basic vibration systems and extends it to oscillatory power systems. Subsequently, an analytical expression of the DLF in DFIG-based wind farms is derived by calculating the dissipated energy and the maximum transient energy at the sub-synchronous frequencies. The DLF is then decomposed into DDLFs according to the physical structure of the oscillatory system, facilitating the development of the DDEM to evaluate the damping contributions. The efficacy of the DDEM is demonstrated through two case studies: the modified IEEE first benchmark model on sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) and the Guyuan wind power system model in North China.</description></item><item><title>A Secure Distributed Computation of Combined Heat and Power Dispatch Based on Transformation Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008674</link><description>The widespread utilization of combined heat and power (CHP) units creates a tight couple between the power transmission system (PTS) and district heating systems (DHS). Since PTS and DHS are always managed by different operators with information security concerns, there has been a growing interest in implementing distributed solutions for combined heat and power dispatch (CHPD). However, existing distributed algorithms require an exchange of information, such as CHP output and dual multipliers, between PTS and DHS, posing a potential risk of information leakage. To address this issue, we introduce a transformation-based method to mask the CHPD model, thereby masking the real economic and physical coefficients using random nonsingular matrices. We discuss the selection principle for encryption matrices to diminish the additional computational burden caused by transformation. Then, we develop an improved Benders decomposition method by introducing valid inequalities and strengthening Benders cut to efficiently solve the masked CHPD problem in a distributed manner. The proposed secure analysis proves that the proposed method can resist two common threat models in information security, including semi-honest adversaries and external eavesdroppers. Numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Capacity Planning of Hybrid Renewable Energy - CCHP System Considering Inter Seasonal Borehole Thermal Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008841</link><description>Combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems are recognized for their high energy efficiency, with utilization rates exceeding 80%. However, traditional CCHP systems often rely on microgas turbines, contributing to carbon emissions. In this paper, we design a hybrid renewable energy - CCHP system, where the electric load is provided by photovoltaic and wind power, and the heating/cooling loads are supplied by converting power to heat by heat pumps. Considering the seasonal variability of renewable energy generation, we introduce borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) into the CCHP system, transforming the ground into a thermal storage that stores excess energy during summer for use in winter. We formulate the problem as a two-stage robust model with decision-dependent uncertainty. Then, we develop a customized algorithm based on Benders decomposition to effectively solve this model and discuss the algorithm improvement techniques. Our approach is validated through a case study of an actual system in Ordos, China, where the effects of BTES integration, uncertainty budget value, and varying ratios of renewable energy are analyzed.</description></item><item><title>A Quantum Annealing-Based Three-Stage Scheduling Strategy for Multi-Stack Fuel Cell Hybrid Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11014234</link><description>Fuel cell hybrid power systems (FCHPS) face significant challenges due to the non-convex nature of their optimization problems, especially in high-power applications with multi-stack configurations that involve numerous start-stop decisions, introducing a high number of binary variables. To address these issues, this paper presents a quantum annealing (QA)-based three-stage scheduling strategy for multi-stack solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-based fuel cell hybrid power systems (FCHPS). The proposed method decouples the decision-making process across different timescales&#8212;day-ahead, intra-day, and real-time&#8212;tailoring decisions to the dynamics of various power sources within the FCHPS. In the day-ahead stage, global predictions inform the startup and shutdown of SOFCs; in the intra-day stage, short-term predictions refine power outputs; and in the real-time stage, adjustments are made to respond to immediate operational conditions. Quantum annealing is introduced to expedite the solution of the large-scale, binary optimization problems inherent in multi-stack configurations. A OPAL-RT-based experimental platform is used to validate the proposed strategy. In addition, a comparison between the proposed method and conventional methods is conducted, indicating that the proposed QA-based approach significantly speeds up the computation process&#8212;being 49.89 times faster than the dual model (DMPC) predictive control method and 22.25 times faster than the Gurobi-based method. It also optimizes the overall operational cost, achieving a reduction in the total objective function value by approximately 10.62% compared to the Gurobi-based method, and by 14.66% compared to the DMPC method.</description></item><item><title>Statistically Feasible Joint Chance-Constrained Scheduling of Integrated Distribution Network and District Heating System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021270</link><description>This paper proposes a statistically feasible joint chance-constrained scheduling framework for integrated power distribution networks (PDN) and district heating systems (DHS). The proposed method constructs data-driven uncertainty sets directly from samples, eliminating the need for prior distribution assumptions. It integrates joint chance-constrained programming (JCCP) with robust optimization (RO) to reformulate the original problem. The resulting model is both tractable and computationally efficient. Additionally, we introduce a novel constraint-specific uncertainty set reconstruction technique. This technique refines the uncertainty set by incorporating optimization-relevant information. It significantly reduces conservatism while ensuring system violation probability requirements. Comparative studies with state-of-the-art uncertainty optimization methods demonstrate the advantages of our approach. The proposed method improves computational efficiency by two orders of magnitude. It also achieves more cost-effective solutions than the best-performing benchmark method.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Solar Power Prediction Using Sky Image Sequences by a Residual Vision Reformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021656</link><description>The unpredictable nature of solar power generation, largely influenced by fluctuating cloud cover, poses a challenge to the stability of renewable energy systems. Considering this, accurate forecasting of solar power can lead to better grid management and operation. With the advent of deep learning models, various models have been suggested to enhance the ultra-short-term solar power forecasting performance. Given that cloud images offer more direct and comprehensive information about cloud patterns compared to the numerical weather prediction data, analyzing cloud images allows for more precise and efficient cloud change predictions, leading to a more accurate ultra-short-term solar power forecasting. In this way, aiming to enhance the forecasting performance, in this paper, we introduce a deep learning-based model, including three main blocks. In the first block, a Multi-Stream Video Vision Transformer (MS-ViViT) model is proposed for extracting different types of spatio-temporal features from the input image sequences. The output features from the first block are input to the second block, Fused Improved Reformer (Fused I-Reformer), including three Improved Reformer (I-Reformer) models equipped with a Fused Encoder as well as a new loss function for sequence learning. Finally, an Attentive Residual Fully Connected (ARFC) model is proposed for solar power value prediction. The comparison results with 36 comparative models on six real-world datasets using seven evaluation metrics confirm the effectiveness of the proposed ultra-short-term solar power forecasting model.</description></item><item><title>Dual Agent Framework for Scheduling Networked Microgrids Using DRL to Improve Resilience</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021619</link><description>The widely reported increase in the frequency of high impact, low probability extreme weather events pose significant challenges to the resilient operation of electric power systems. This paper explores strategies to enhance operational resilience that addresses the distribution network&#8217;s ability to adapt to changing operating conditions. We introduce a novel Dual Agent-Based framework for optimizing the scheduling of distributed energy resources (DERs) within a networked microgrid (N-MG) using the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) paradigm. This framework focuses on minimizing operational and environmental costs during normal operations while enhancing critical load supply indices (CSI) under emergency conditions. Additionally, we introduce a multi-temporal dynamic reward shaping structure along with the incorporation of an error coefficient to enhance the learning process of the agents. To appropriately manage loads during emergencies, we propose a load flexibility classification system that categorizes loads based on its criticality index. The scalability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through running multiple case-studies on a modified IEEE 123-node benchmark distribution network. Furthermore, validation of the method is provided by means of comparisons with two metaheuristic algorithms namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA).</description></item><item><title>Sample-Wise Graph-Based Multivariate Short-Term PV Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11024230</link><description>Reliable short-term photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting is of crucial significance for the rational dispatching of power sources and the effective control of operating costs for the power grid. However, temporal misalignment and regression accuracy imbalance of PV power data pose significant challenges to the reliability of forecast results. In this study, multivariate PV power forecasting is investigated from the perspective of forecast model samples. Firstly, the extent of misalignment of a sample is parameterized by a time-delay vector. Subsequently, the sample-wise graph is defined to relate the time-delay vector with PV power data. Then, the time-delay vector is estimated by minimizing the smoothness metric of the sample-wise graph. Finally, a sample-wise graph-based sample weighting strategy is introduced to address the issue of regression accuracy imbalance. The efficiency of the proposed PV power forecasting scheme is validated through extensive experiments on real-world datasets. Comparison experiments suggest that the proposed scheme can achieve remarkably improved short-term PV power forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Error-Based Active Disturbance Rejection Power Control for Large-Scale Wind Turbines Under Pitch Actuator Performance Degradation Failure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11027442</link><description>This study addresses the critical challenge of constant power control for large-scale wind energy conversion system under the combined effects of pitch actuator degradation and multiple disturbances. In the paper, a novel fault-tolerant control strategy based on error-based active rejection control (E-ADRC) is proposed. The approach incorporates a composite control architecture, comprising a disturbance rejection tracking loop and a fault-tolerant compensation loop. Within the tracking loop, an enhanced E-ADRC algorithm is suggested which not only retains the robustness and ease of implementation of traditional E-ADRC but also significantly improves the attenuation of low-frequency wind disturbances&#8212;the turbine&#8217;s primary disruption. The fault-tolerant compensation loop applies independent control signals, derived from pitch angle residuals, to each faulty actuator, mitigating the extra fault disturbances in rotor speed tracking dynamics. This dual-loop structure enables the turbine to restore high-stability power output after a fault. Furthermore, the fault-tolerant compensation mechanism ensures that, even in cases of part of the three actuators failure, the previously misaligned pitch angles are synchronized, effectively suppressing the detrimental aerodynamic imbalance and reducing adverse loads. The superiority of this approach in enhancing power output stability and reducing structure fatigue damage have been validated through a refined hardware-in-the-loop test.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming IBRs Under Unbalanced Grid Conditions: Challenges, Solutions, and Prospects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11027640</link><description>The penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into the grid is experiencing significant growth. Their control behavior during unbalanced grid conditions can impact system stability and protection. This paper evaluates the performance of prevalent grid-forming control-based IBRs (GFM-IBRs) under unbalanced grid conditions and proposes novel insights in a novel framework. First, we investigate the potential impacts of grid-forming control-based IBRs (GFM-IBRs) on system dynamics, protection, and fault ride-through (FRT) capability under unbalanced grid conditions based on extensive literature review and through EMT simulations in benchmark systems with IBRs. To discover these impacts and accommodate unbalanced grid conditions, we implement a generic control structure for full converter-based GFM-IBRs under FRT mode, then perform a comparative analysis of existing solutions that include sequence decomposition methods, positive sequence current-limiting methods, negative sequence controls, and current coordination methods, to identify their capabilities and limitations through literature review and EMT simulations in a large-scale power system. Finally, key challenges and solutions are discussed, highlighting prospects for future research.</description></item><item><title>Probability Density Function Control of Frequency Fluctuations in Renewable-Rich Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029151</link><description>The stochastic nature of renewable energy sources (RESs) necessitates treating power system frequency response as a random process with a nonstationary probability density function (PDF). Based upon the stochastic distribution control theory originated by the second author, this paper proposes a novel stochastic controller to improve the frequency PDF in power grids when integrating a large amount of RESs, thereby minimizing the effects of uncertainties and enhancing overall system stability. The key idea is to manipulate the controllable power generation resources so that the frequency PDF is make to follow a target PDF by using the stochastic distribution control theory originated by the second author. The proposed method can easily be plugged into existing automatic generation controls for multi-area transmission grids. The proposed method is validated via a modified Kundar&#8217;s two area system and 240-bus Western Electricity Coordinating Council systems. The simulation results show that the proposed control shapes the frequency PDF narrower and sharper, leading to a notable improvement toward minimizing the effects of randomness and uncertainty during grid operation.</description></item><item><title>Collaborative Operation of Renewable Energy Hydrogen Production Systems Considering Balanced Utilization and Extended Lifespan of Multi-Electrolyzers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029129</link><description>To address the challenges of low efficiency, poor economic performance, and limited adaptability in renewable energy&#8211;coupled alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) systems, this study proposes a power&#8211;state rolling optimization strategy (PSROS) based on a two-stage optimization framework. First, the large-scale AWE system is divided into multiple modules to reduce the variable dimension of the optimization problem. Then, a simplified module-level optimal efficiency model is developed based on the efficiency characteristics of AWE units. Subsequently, multi-objective optimization models are constructed at the module and unit levels, comprehensively considering hydrogen production volume, lifespan degradation, and utilization balancing. Finally, a finite-horizon rolling optimization mechanism is introduced to solve the two-stage optimization problem, improving the continuity and rationality of scheduling decisions at the end of each optimization horizon. Annual case study results demonstrate that, under the non-battery scenario, PSROS improves system efficiency by 9.92%, 11.12%, and 3.81%, and reduces the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) by 4.14, 5.43, and 2.35 CNY/kg compared with the simple start-stop strategy (SSSS), array rotation strategy (ARS), and rolling optimization strategy (ROS), respectively. With battery integration, the system efficiency is further improved by 0.77%, and the LCOH is further reduced by 0.49 CNY/kg.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Scheduling of Integrated Electric-Hydrogen-Thermal Systems Considering Hydroelectric Power Plant Peaking for Hydrogen Vessel Navigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11030854</link><description>Transporting hydrogen by vessels may be more cost-effective than hydrogen trailers and hydrogen tankers, but it is also more sensitive to environmental factors (e.g., river levels). In order to capitalize on the advantages of based-vessel waterway hydrogen chains, a new short-term scheduling strategy of integrated electric-hydrogen-Thermal systems considering the hydroelectric power plant peaking for hydrogen vessel (HV) navigation is proposed in this paper. First, a temporal-spatial operational model of waterway hydrogen chains is developed. In this model, the relationship between the electrolysis temperature, hydrogen production efficiency, and maximum available operational power of the reversible solid oxide fuel cell (RSOC) is modelled. The impact of the hydroelectric power plant underflow on HV transfer is also evaluated. On this basis, a flexible multi-day collaborative scheduling strategy of the electric-hydrogen integrated system is designed, where the main power source, i.e., thermoelectric plant (TEP), is allowed to operate in pure power generation mode or cogeneration mode to release the operation flexibility. This scheduling model is first linearized as a mixed-integer second-order conic programming (MISOCP) problem and then solved efficiently through a two-layer method. Finally, case studies on a modified IEEE 118-node power system verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Region of Attraction Estimation for Power Systems With Multiple Integrated DFIG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11031118</link><description>The lack of suitable modeling methods for power systems with multiple doubly-fed induction generator-based wind turbines (DFIGWTs) integrated has left the analytical description of the boundary of the region of attraction (ROA) of such systems largely unexplored. To address this gap, this paper derives an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model for a power system with multiple DFIGWTs integrated. The proposed electromechanical model is validated in a single-machine-infinite-bus (SMIB) power system and a modified 3 machine 9 bus power system with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of less than 9.5% for trajectory comparisons with the full model, demonstrating that it accurately captures the low-frequency dynamics of the full DFIGWT model. Subsequently, the ODE model is transformed into a polynomial differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model using a nonlinear coordinate transformation. To estimate the ROA, an enhanced expanding interior algorithm (EIA) based on sum of squares (SOS) programming is applied. The feasibility of the proposed model, along with the appropriate conservativeness of the improved EIA, is validated using two test systems that include multiple DFIGWTs and synchronous generators (SGs). By comparison, it is found that the time cost of the improved EIA is reduced by around 17% while maintaining the accuracy. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach has significant practical implications for the integration of wind farms into power systems, and offers an efficient tool for transient stability analysis.</description></item><item><title>Extreme Probabilistic Solar Power Prediction via Localized Sample Structure Recognition and Generalized Error Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11033220</link><description>The fluctuations and uncertainty of solar power constantly threaten the secure operation and economic dispatch of power systems. Existing end-to-end point or probabilistic solar power prediction methods mostly lack effective integration of the two approaches, and the latent error caused by machine learning (ML) techniques is rarely taken into consideration. Hence in this paper, a combined extreme probabilistic solar power prediction (EPSPP) scheme is proposed, by integrating point forecasting with extreme error estimation. Firstly, the localized sample structure recognition (LSSR) is conducted to determine the neighborhood of meteorological conditions, where feature weights of Euclidean distance measurement are allocated with respect to the valid mutual information (MI) derived by two-dimensional diffusion kernel density estimation (2D-DKDE). Secondly, with the neighborhood generated by LSSR, an improved localized generalization error estimation (ILGEE) algorithm is put forward to infer the real-time maximal second-order origin moment of solar power point forecasting error corresponding to designated confidence levels. Finally, the solar power at each temporal moment is deduced as distinct Gaussian distributions, by modifying the mean value and variance according to statistical principles. For the sake of the so-called &#8220;extreme&#8221;, the proposed scheme could maintain reliability even under circumstances of the worst ML model precision. Cases from a real-world solar power station in Oregon, USA, are used to validate its effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>A Mechanism-Based Convex Model of Fuel Cell Systems Considering the Effect of Auxiliary System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10976439</link><description>Fuel cell systems (FCS) are recognized as promising electric sources of power systems. However, existing FCS models are either nonconvex or inaccurate when the FCS is under heavy load. This letter proposes a mechanism-based FCS feasible operational area (FCSFOA) model, taking into account the decline in fuel cell efficiency and the dynamic power consumption of the auxiliary system. Therefore, the FCSFOA model is accurate both under light load and heavy load, and the average error is only 5.4% compared with the actual data. In contrast, the FCS linear model, the most commonly used in the dispatch of power systems, has an average error of 24.4% . Besides, the FCSFOA model is also convex, which is favorable for the dispatch of power systems.</description></item><item><title>Mutual Information-Enhanced NARX-NN Digital Twins for Power Electronics in Smart Grid Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131160</link><description>This paper presents a systematic and innovative data&#8211;driven framework for constructing Mutual Information&#8211;enhanced NARX&#8211;NN Digital Twins (DTs) of power electronic converters, demonstrated on a DC&#8211;DC boost converter in continuous conduction mode under closed&#8211;loop voltage control. A Digital Twin Instance (DTI) of the inductance current is built via time&#8211;delay embedding of hidden dynamic attractors. Sampling frequency is optimized using self&#8211;Mutual Average Information (sMAI) to capture intra&#8211;cycle Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) dynamics. Input preselection uses correlation analysis and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), followed by delay assignment via sMAI and cross-MAI (cMAI). The False Nearest Neighbours (FNN) criterion determines the minimal embedding dimension. Two NARX&#8211;NN configurations (4D and 5D) are trained on a high&#8211;fidelity MATLAB&#8211;SIMULINK model including parasitics, filtering, and non&#8211;idealities. Although thermal and voltage variations are excluded to isolate modelling effects, the 5D model outperforms the 4D under both nominal and perturbed loads. In the frequency domain (up to 50 kHz), it improves amplitude tracking. Experimental validation via offline transfer learning reduces steady&#8211;state error to approximately  $\pm \,1\%$  and transient errors to a few percent, peaking at -13% in unseen saturation case. The resulting DTIs are lightweight (&lt;1 GFLOPS), delay-aware, and interpretable, enabling scalable real&#8211;time integration into converter&#8211;centric smart grid digital twin architectures without solving differential equations.</description></item><item><title>RoCoF and Nadir of Frequency Optimization Control for Cluster-Oriented Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142799</link><description>The cluster-oriented microgrids can better manage large-scale renewable energy integration systems compared to individual microgrids, the operation control of microgrid clusters (MGCs) under disturbances still face numerous challenges. Apart from the mainstream steady-state requirements, the transient performances of nadir of frequency (NoF) and the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) exhibit more practical significance. To this end, this paper proposes a multi-index optimization approach to provide an optimal control-design solution for MGCs, enhancing the system robustness and security. Firstly, steady-state stability conditions directly related to two-layer cooperative (TLC) control parameters are derived using a quasi-invariance property. Secondly, the control parameter related sufficient conditions to guarantee the NoF and RoCoF transient performance indexes are analyzed and formulated through a matrix inequality. Lastly, a multi-index objective function is designed to integrate all these conditions, yielding optimal control parameters that make all constraints hold. Real-time simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Secondary Control for DC Microgrids With Near-Infinite Constant Power Load Accommodation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151627</link><description>In DC microgrids, constant power loads (CPLs) inherently exhibit negative impedance characteristics, which are widely believed to degrade system stability as their penetration level increases. Consequently, extensive research has aimed to establish safe upper bounds for CPL penetration. However, these upper bounds are typically derived as sufficient conditions, making them overly conservative. Moreover, when multiple DC sources are connected in parallel to a common DC bus, the simultaneous need for current sharing and DC bus voltage regulation further complicates system control. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel distributed secondary control method based on the dynamic averaging of virtual voltage drops (VVDs). The proposed method offers two key advantages: 1) It ensures both precise current sharing and voltage regulation in single-bus DC microgrids, even in the presence of mixed ZIP loads, i.e., constant resistive loads (Z), constant current loads (I), and constant power loads (P). 2) Unlike existing approaches that impose conservative limits on CPL penetration, the proposed method theoretically demonstrates that the safe upper bound for CPLs can be arbitrarily large, enabling the DC microgrid to accommodate an almost infinite number of CPLs without compromising stability. Both Simulation and experiment studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Safety-Guaranteed Voltage Regulation of Distribution Networks Using a Learning-Assisted Switching Tube Model Predictive Control Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11124582</link><description>This article proposes a learning-assisted switching tube model predictive control (S-TMPC) approach to achieve absolutely safety-guaranteed voltage regulation in distribution networks (DNs). In order to model time-varying operation modes, the switching dynamics have been introduced based on respective equilibrium points in DNs. Then, to quantify the safe operation region of each mode, an active learning algorithm with a reliable oracle is developed to estimate the safety-guaranteed reachable set, which simplifies the conventionally linear-matrix-inequalities-based (LMI-based) computation. Next, considering power disturbances of renewable energy generation, a tube model predictive control approach for safe voltage regulation is introduced, and its exponential stability condition is given. Once the voltage deviation exceeds the boundary of the operation mode, a learning-assisted switching mechanism, of which the switching action is enabled by admissible minimum dwell-time analysis of switches among safe reachable sets (i.e., pre-learned tubes) is developed to absolutely ensure a safe voltage regulation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed voltage regulation method is verified by representative simulations and experiment tests.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Imitation&#8211;Reinforcement Learning Framework for Optimal Operation of Soft Open Points in Unbalanced Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131604</link><description>This paper proposes a hybrid actor-critic framework for the optimal operation of a phase-changing soft open point (PCSOP) in an unbalanced distribution network.

This work highlights the importance of sizing optimization in enhancing the economic feasibility and production potential of large-scale ISDSE systems.</description></item><item><title>Weather Routing-Based Multi-Energy Ship Microgrid Operation Under Diverse Uncertainties: A Risk-Averse Stochastic Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11145936</link><description>The voyage environment, such as weather conditions, directly influences the propulsion load of a ship and even poses challenges to its safe journey. In this context, this article proposes a novel weather routing based operation approach for a multi-energy ship microgrid (MESM), which not only coordinates the heterogeneous onboard energy flows (e.g., electricity, thermal energy, green hydrogen, and freshwater) while also optimizing voyage route and speed based on dynamic weather conditions. In particular, a detailed weather-based route selection model and a weather-dependent propulsion load model are formulated, accounting for key environmental factors such as wind, waves, and drifting ice.

Nonetheless, diverse available time intervals for DRs impose substantial computational burdens for aggregation and may lead to infeasible dispatch after disaggregation. This work proposes an efficient reduction method for aggregating DRs with diverse time intervals and demand requirements while ensuring feasible dispatch. The method determines how to reduce the time interval ranges of all DRs to alleviate dispatch complexity. We reformulate an equivalent ILP problem with an available time interval matrix to reduce the problem scale. To further alleviate the computational burden, a fast approximation algorithm that combines interval clustering and weight selection is designed for large-scale DR aggregation. Numerical tests show that the proposed method maintains larger aggregated feasible regions to provide more flexibility than other inner-approximation methods, while maintaining feasible dispatch. Overall, the reformulated problem and fast approximation algorithm effectively reduce the computational time with a limited reduction in dispatch optimality.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Enabled Adaptive Power Capping Scheme for Cloud Data Centers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123584</link><description>The rapid growth of the digital economy and artificial intelligence has transformed cloud data centers into essential infrastructure with substantial energy consumption and carbon emission, necessitating effective energy management. However, existing methods face challenges such as incomplete information, uncertain parameters, and dynamic environments, which hinder their real-world implementation. This paper proposes an adaptive power capping framework tailored to cloud data centers. By dynamically setting the energy consumption upper bound, the power load of data centers can be reshaped to align with the electricity price or other market signals. To this end, we formulate the power capping problem as a partially observable Markov decision process. Subsequently, we develop an uncertainty-aware model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) method to perceive the cloud data center operational environment and optimize power-capping decisions. By incorporating a two-stage uncertainty-aware optimization algorithm into the MBRL, we improve its adaptability to the ever-changing environment. Additionally, we derive the optimality gap of the proposed scheme under finite iterations, ensuring effective decisions under complex and uncertain scenarios. The numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method using a cloud data center operational environment simulator built on real-world production traces from Alibaba, which demonstrates its potential as an efficient energy management solution for cloud data centers.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Economic Dispatch in Microgrids via Robust Gradient-Tracking Over Directed Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126159</link><description>Existing differentially private optimization algorithms for the distributed economic dispatch problem (EDP) often involve a trade-off between privacy performance and optimization accuracy. This paper presents a robust gradient-tracking based differentially private distributed algorithm to enhance both privacy performance and optimization accuracy for EDP. In particular, we employ solely row stochastic weight matrices to enable each agent to locally allocate weights to received messages. Moreover, unlike most existing approaches that rely on decaying noise, our algorithm integrates persistent noise into the exchanged information to enhance privacy performance. To mitigate the impact of persistent noise, we incorporate robust gradient-tracking techniques and introduce noise attenuation factors. By carefully selecting the step size and noise attenuation factors, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves almost sure convergence while simultaneously ensuring  $\epsilon $ -differential privacy. Finally, simulation experiments conducted on the modified IEEE 14-bus microgrid system and IEEE 118-bus power system validate the effectiveness of our algorithm in terms of both convergence and privacy performance.</description></item><item><title>End-to-End Stochastic Predict-Then-Optimize for Cost-Efficient Water-Energy Resource Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142824</link><description>Compared to other energy-intensive industries, urban water supply systems are unique due to the strong temporal coupling with the power grid, which intensifies grid stress during peak hours. This paper addresses the water-energy nexus by developing a water-energy resource scheduling model for whole-process water supply that incorporates electricity cost prediction uncertainties. Meanwhile, to minimize the scheduling cost in an end-to-end approach, we propose the Stochastic Predict-then-Optimize (SPTO), which aligns prediction distribution with the optimality gap by integrating probabilistic forecasting with stochastic optimization. Unlike traditional two-stage approaches, SPTO establishes a closed-loop feedback between forecasting and optimization, reducing cumulative errors and improving real-time adaptability. To enable end-to-end training, we derive the SPTO+, a differentiable convex upper-bound surrogate function based on Lagrangian duality, which provides surrogate gradient computation for end-to-end training. Experiments on real-world systems demonstrate that SPTO significantly reduces operational cost and decision regret, effectively coordinating water operations with dynamic grid conditions to support cost-efficient and grid-responsive scheduling.</description></item><item><title>Disaggregating Distributed PV Power From Aggregate Measurements in Transmission Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11135456</link><description>The growing integration of Photovoltaic (PV) systems into distribution networks has limited visibility for system operators, as the power output of low-power PV systems is not typically monitored. The study presented in this paper introduces a novel approach for disaggregating PV generation from net-load measurements recorded at the transmission system level. The proposed technique is applied to actual data from an existing transmission line feeder to identify PV generation from net demand measurements. The developed methodology incorporates Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for detecting PV panels based on an algorithm that provides an accurate estimate of solar PV capacity. These estimations are validated against actual data from a local utility, showing a close match between the two. This information is then utilized in reliable software tools to simulate PV power generation in the studied region, which is then used to estimate and disaggregate the generated power from net-load data by applying multiple Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. The results demonstrate that, with the proposed approach, it is feasible to adequately disaggregate PV power generation from transmission feeder net-load measurements with minimal or no additional sensor infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Energy Management Strategy for Distribution Network With Distributed Renewable Based on Learning-Driven Model Predictive Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11130449</link><description>This paper investigates the energy management of distribution network with distributed renewable.

A battery energy storage system (BESS) is commonly used to manage these demand charges. Economic model predictive control (EMPC) with a reference trajectory can be used to dispatch the BESS to optimize the microgrid operating cost. Since demand charges are incurred monthly, EMPC requires a full-month reference trajectory for asymptotic stability guarantees that result in optimal operating costs. However, a full-month reference trajectory is unrealistic from a renewable generation forecast perspective. Therefore, to construct a practical EMPC with a reference trajectory, an EMPC formulation considering both non-coincident demand and on-peak demand charges is designed in this work for 24 to 48 h prediction horizons. The corresponding reference trajectory is computed at each EMPC step by solving an optimal control problem over 24 to 48 h reference (trajectory) horizon. Furthermore, BESS state of charge regulation constraints are incorporated to guarantee the BESS energy level in the long term. Multiple reference and prediction horizon lengths are compared for both shrinking and rolling horizons with real-world data. The proposed EMPC with 48 hour rolling reference and prediction horizons outperforms the traditional EMPC benchmark with a 2% reduction in the annual cost, proving its economic benefits.</description></item><item><title>Two-Tier Aggregation of Distributed Energy Storage Units Considering Network Access Purchase</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131318</link><description>The number of distributed energy storage units (ESUs) within a distribution network is expected to increase because of the rapid deployment of 5G base stations, and they can be aggregated and formulated into a bid model of polytopic shape, which is consistent with market rules. However, it is challenging to design such a polytope that best captures their aggregate flexibility and satisfies distribution network constraints. This paper proposes a two-tier inner approximation aggregation model that aggregates the flexibility of ESUs first to the corresponding network buses and then to the substation. The uncertain power load of the 5G base station affects the minimum reserved energy of its backup battery. Therefore, with the aid of distributionally robust chance-constrained programming, a customized affine transformation-based method for inner approximation of the flexibility set is proposed to capture the charge/discharge logic and to handle uncertainty. In addition, the acquisition of network access limits is integrated into the optimal flexibility design of the aggregator by deriving the approximate form of the cost function in an auction framework. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of economy and uncertainty handling.</description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity by Design for Resilient Voltage Regulation in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131258</link><description>The transition to smart grids is advancing through the integration of grid-connected devices such as distributed energy resource (DER) inverters, distribution static synchronous compensators (D-STATCOMs), and electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, all of which play a vital role in voltage regulation within active distribution networks (DNs). Yet, these devices face growing exposure to cyber threats. This paper proposes a cybersecurity framework embedded directly within their control systems to address these risks by design. Drawing on the widespread deployment of distribution phasor measurement units (D-PMUs) for voltage monitoring, the framework incorporates a digital twin for real-time assessment, supported by data fidelity tests. This approach enables the timely detection and mitigation of false-data injection (FDI) and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, preserving voltage stability without requiring hardware modifications. Simulations on the IEEE 33-node test feeder confirm the framework&#8217;s effectiveness in strengthening the resilience and security of grid-connected systems, representing a meaningful step forward in the protection of smart grids.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Analysis of Virtual Power Plants for Peak-Regulation Service Using Phased Mission System Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11133693</link><description>This paper proposes a reliability analysis method of virtual power plants (VPPs) for peak-regulation service by adopting the phased mission system (PMS) framework. Firstly, the PMS framework of VPP for peak regulation service is established by modeling it as a multi-phased mission, decomposed into several tasks including receiving, assigning, and executing the peak-regulation instructions. Besides, the single-phased binary decision diagram (BDD) model is proposed to evaluate the VPP&#8217;s performance of single-phased mission with the consideration of prime and auxiliary approaches for different tasks. Moreover, the whole-phased BDD model is proposed to analyze the VPP&#8217;s reliability for peak-regulation service by integrating the single-phased BDD model. Next, two reliability indices of VPP towards peak-regulation services are novelly proposed to represent the success rate and the insufficiency of peak-regulation service. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through extensive numerical tests on a verified IEEE test system.</description></item><item><title>Quantum Optimization for Optimal Power Flow: CVQLS-Augmented Interior Point Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11137411</link><description>This paper presents a quantum-enhanced optimization approach for solving optimal power flow (OPF) by integrating the interior point method (IPM) with a coherent variational quantum linear solver (CVQLS). The objective is to explore the applicability of quantum computing to power systems optimization and address the associated challenges. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art quantum linear solvers&#8212;Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL), variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), and CVQLS&#8212;revealed that CVQLS is most suitable for OPF due to its stability with ill-conditioned matrices, such as the Hessian in IPM. To ensure high-quality solutions, prevent suboptimal convergence, and avoid the barren plateau problem, we propose a quantum circuit parameter initialization technique along with a method to guide the IPM along the central path. Moreover, we design an ansatz tailored for OPF, optimizing the expressibility and trainability of the quantum circuit to ensure efficient convergence and robustness in solving quantum OPF. Various optimizers are also tested for quantum circuit parameter optimization to select the best one. We evaluate our approaches on multiple systems to show their effectiveness in providing reliable OPF solutions. Simulations for the 2-bus system are conducted on a commercial IBMQ quantum device, while simulations for the other larger cases are performed using the IBM quantum simulator. While promising, CVQLS is limited by current quantum hardware, especially for larger systems. We use a quantum noise simulator to test scalability.</description></item><item><title>Aggregation of Heterogeneous DERs by the Subgradient Vertex Search Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11141502</link><description>The exploitation of distributed energy resources (DERs) is essential for the advancement of smart grids. However, the heterogeneity and scale of DERs pose major challenges to their aggregation, which is necessary to maximize their potential. This study adopts a linearized model that integrates a diverse array of DERs including power generation, energy storage, and flexible loads with varying dissipation rates. We used the model to analyze the compact form and mathematical implications of aggregation, for which we propose the subgradient vertex search method to solve. This method efficiently identifies vertices of the aggregate feasible region, which are used to construct its convex hull. Unlike traditional hyperplane-based methods, this method not only provides an inner approximation efficiently but also can converge to the exact solution. Numerical simulations validated its accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an energy flowchart to visualize high-dimensional space of energy change processes and provide a case study involving two vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging piles to explain the mechanism of feasible region scaling, demonstrating the practical significance of precise aggregation.</description></item><item><title>Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning for Resilient Self-Proactive Distribution Grids Against Wildfires</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142361</link><description>With the growing risks and frequency of wildfires, power distribution systems (PDS) face significant challenges in maintaining reliability and security. Existing literature primarily focuses on post-event service restoration using stochastic optimization methods. Nevertheless, such approaches fall short in managing the dynamic and uncertain nature of wildfires, particularly when it comes to taking proactive measures to mitigate power outages. To address this problem, this paper introduces a wildfire smart resilience controller (WF-SRC) that utilizes a model-assisted safe Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) mechanism to reduce the impacts of wildfire-induced disruptions. The WF-SRC continuously monitors and analyzes both the status of the PDS and the spatiotemporal dynamics of wildfires, then executes preemptive actions to prevent wildfires from compromising distribution lines. These actions include optimally dispatching stationary and mobile distributed energy resources (DERs) that operate under a master-slave control scheme. While recent works assume full observability and formulate the PDS resilience problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), this approach leads to an impractically large state space and limited realism. In contrast, our approach models the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). This explicitly captures real-world sensing limitations, such as noisy measurements that arise during extreme events. The POMDP is tackled using an LSTM-TD3 DRL agent, enabling effective sequential decision-making in environments with incomplete information. Using real-world data from Alberta wildfires, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in reducing wildfire impact, optimizing energy distribution, and enhancing robustness to uncertainties, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and proactive power grid.</description></item><item><title>Synergising Hierarchical Data Centers and Power Networks: A Privacy-Preserving Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142335</link><description>In the era of digitization, data centers have emerged as integral contributors sustaining our interlinked world, bearing responsibility for an increasing proportion of the world&#8217;s energy consumption. To facilitate the their fast rollout while progressing towards net-zero energy systems, the synergy of hierarchical data centers (cloud-fog-edge) and power networks can play a pivotal role. However, existing centralized co-dispatch manners encroach on the privacy of different agents within the integrated systems, meanwhile suffering from the combinatorial explosion. In this research, we propose a near-optimal distributed privacy-preserving approach to solve the non-convex synergy (day-ahead co-dispatch) problem. The synergy problem is formulated as a mixed integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming considering both communication and energy conservation, where Lyapunov optimization is introduced to balance operating costs and uncertain communication delays. To mitigate impacts of the highly non-convex nature, the normalized multi-parametric disaggregation technique is leveraged to reformulate the problem into a mixed integer non-linear programming. To further overcome non-smoothness of the reformulated problem, the customized  $\ell _{1}-$ surrogate Lagrangian relaxation method with convergence guarantees is proposed to solve the problem in a distributed privacy-preserving manner. The effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed methodologies for the synergy problem are validated via numerical simulations. The results also indicate that computing tasks can be migrated within the hierarchical data centers, demonstrating the flexible resource allocation capabilities of the hierarchical architecture, further facilitating peak load balancing in the power network.</description></item><item><title>Performance-Integrated Virtual Power Plant Management in the Frequency Regulation Market</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11146637</link><description>Renewable integration in power systems causes a surge of frequency fluctuations, primarily due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy. To address this challenge, distributed energy resources (DERs) pave one promising way for frequency regulation by their aggregation as a virtual power plant (VPP). For a VPP participating in the frequency regulation market, its regulation performance is critical for interaction with the system operator. This paper explores a performance-integrated management scheme for a VPP to optimize the utilization of heterogeneous DERs in the frequency regulation market. The relationship between the regulation performance and the DER reserve portfolio is first revealed through a data-driven method, which has rarely been studied in current work. This facilitates the integration of the mapped frequency regulation performance into the aggregation and disaggregation processes in the VPP management. Furthermore, in the aggregation process, the VPP&#8217;s feasible operation region associated with the high-dimensional variables and constraints is characterized through a cluster-based aggregation method. Given the massive heterogeneous DERs, this proposed method ensures satisfactory accuracy within the reduced computation time by efficiently capturing the representative DER characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified using real-world DER data from the Dataport database.</description></item><item><title>Assessment, Cause Localization, and Mitigation for Small-Signal Stability Risks in Multi-Parallel Grid-Forming Converter Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151621</link><description>This article addresses small-signal stability issues for multi-parallel grid-forming converter systems based on a newly developed extended passivity theory.

The objective is to unify and simplify the tasks for (i) clustering visualisation, (ii) outlier detection and (iii) generative profile modelling under one concept. The lower dimensional projection of standardised MV load profiles unveils a latent distribution in a three-dimensional sphere. This spherical structure allows us to detect outliers by fitting probability distribution models in the spherical coordinate system, identifying measurements that deviate from the spherical shape. The same latent distribution exhibits an arc shape, suggesting an underlying order among load profiles. We develop a principal curve technique to uncover this order based on similarity, offering new advantages over conventional clustering techniques. This finding reveals that energy consumption in a wide region can be seen as a continuously changing process. Furthermore, we combined the principal curve with a von Mises-Fisher distribution to create a model capable of generating profiles with continuous mixtures between clusters. The presence of the spherical distribution is validated with data from four municipalities in the Netherlands. The uncovered spherical structure implies the possibility of employing new mathematical tools from directional statistics and differential geometry for load profile modelling.</description></item><item><title>Power-SAM: An Advanced Abnormality Change Detection Algorithm for Intelligent Monitoring in Power Equipment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126170</link><description>Timely detection and management of abnormalities are critical to ensuring the safe and stable operation of the smart grid. To address this, a novel abnormal change detection (ACD) model, termed Power-SAM, is proposed for smart grids based on Artificial Intelligence. Firstly, integrate the strong generalization capabilities and efficient image segmentation performance of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) while employing fine-tuning strategies to enhance its applicability for processing images in power scenarios. Secondly, the Time Difference Feature Generator (TDFG) was designed to generate feature vectors suitable for ACD, allowing SAM to adapt to power ACD tasks. Thirdly, a feature fusion network, which combined feature aggregation with differential computation, was adopted, enhancing the model&#8217;s ability to detect subtle changes in power scenes. Lastly, CBAM-FPN by integrating Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and lightweight Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) was introduced to Power-SAM, improving ACD performance for multiscale targets. An image dataset for substation change detection was constructed from real-world power scenarios and ACD requirements. This dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed Power-SAM model. The results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU metrics of 95.25%, 93.35%, 94.41%, and 89.41%, respectively, outperforming current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence models.</description></item><item><title>Prediction of Charging Station Load Uncertainty Based on Multi-Dimensional Quantile Spatial-Temporal Traffic Flow Forecast</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119652</link><description>The uncertainty prediction of electric vehicle charging station load plays a crucial role in ensuring the stable operation of power grids. In this paper, a charging station load uncertainty prediction method based on multi-dimensional quantile spatial-temporal traffic flow forecast is proposed. First, considering the complex spatial-temporal correlation characteristics of traffic flow, a traffic flow forecast model based on multi-dimensional spatial-temporal graph convolutional network is designed. The model can deeply explore spatial-temporal correlation characteristics and effectively capture both the static spatial correlations with fixed topological structures and the dynamic spatial correlations of real-time traffic flow. Second, taking into account the importance of prediction results under different confidence levels, this paper combines the forecast model with a weighted quantile regression model and introduces a novel weighted loss function, which can achieve traffic flow uncertainty prediction without the need to predefine the uncertainty probability density distribution and meet the differentiated requirements for uncertainty prediction in grid operation and business decision-making. Furthermore, considering the influence of factors such as road congestion and electricity prices on charging load, a charging station load uncertainty prediction model based on an enhanced queuing model is proposed, which can more accurately convert traffic flow uncertainty into load uncertainty, and thus more accurately simulate the charging station loads. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Accelerated Distributed Economic Dispatch in Vehicle-to-Grid Integrated Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119663</link><description>Next-generation smart grids require decentralized optimization frameworks to coordinate diverse energy assets, including renewables, dispatchable generators, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G)-enabled electric vehicles (EVs). A critical challenge lies in reducing the overall communication overhead and computational burden for distributed economic dispatch through learning-accelerated optimization, while addressing uncertainties in EV charging patterns, time-varying communication networks, and battery longevity constraints. This paper proposes a learning-accelerated distributed optimization framework for V2G-integrated microgrids. A novel alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) enhanced by deep neural networks, termed learning-accelerated ADMM (LA-ADMM), is developed to predict optimal dual variables, with theoretical convergence under dynamic network conditions rigorously proved. For handling EV uncertainties, the framework incorporates model predictive control (MPC) architecture with dispatch package strategies that minimize computational overhead through adaptive reuse of historical solutions during steady-state operations. Battery lifespan preservation is achieved through tight coupling of operational constraints with a universal constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) charging protocol.

Electric vehicles (EVs), with their rapid response capabilities and growing penetration, offer promising potential for providing virtual inertia services. In this paper, a novel fast frequency response framework with virtual inertia of EVs is proposed in a coupled power-transportation network. The proposed framework addresses the complex coordination required across multiple stakeholders through a hierarchical approach encompassing grid operators, charging stations (CSs), and EV users. At the grid level, the optimal inertia scheduling is developed to reduce system costs, considering the spatial-temporal characteristics of EVs and power fluctuations. For coordination between CSs, a game-theoretic incentive mechanism is designed to maximize collective benefits while encouraging EV participation in inertia services. In each CS, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based inertia control strategy can achieve the optimal inertia distribution, considering both EV battery conditions and user requirements. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. This approach provides a feasible operation solution for providing EV-based inertia in modern low-inertia grids.</description></item><item><title>Risk-Averse Decision-Dependent Distributionally Robust Optimization for the Resilient Cyber-Physical Distribution System Against Contingencies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126174</link><description>The cyber-physical deep coupling brings the distribution system the possibility of superposition vulnerability on cyber and physical spaces, which will potentially raise the unobservability and uncontrollability issues of the system, readily causing power outages during contingencies. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a resilience-oriented design for the cyber-physical distribution system based on a risk-averse decision-dependent distributionally robust optimization (DD-DRO) model. Firstly, observable and controllable intentional islands, as a promising way, are formed against contingencies by remote-controlled switch deployment, wireless communication configuration, and local controller activation. To this end, the cyber-physical coupling mechanism is investigated by hybrid wired/wireless communication modeling and fault propagation modeling, ensuring the cyber system&#8217;s observation and control. Secondly, reinforcement measures are adopted to mitigate the risk of uncertain contingencies, however, triggering decision-dependent uncertainty. To handle this uncertainty, the adaptive moment information method is developed to construct an N-k decision-dependent ambiguity set. Therefore, the proposed DD-DRO model is formulated and then recast to a mixed-integer linear programming problem by linearization techniques, which is solved by a customized nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm. Finally, numerical results on the modified IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 69-bus test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and method.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Sensing, Transmission and Control for QKD-IoT Empowered Power-Communication Coupling Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126162</link><description>Quantum-classical hybrid encryption has elevated security levels of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled distributed power control. However, the decoupled design of communication and power systems introduces substantial technical challenges. Outdated or tampered state data propagating from communication to power domains trigger cascading control failures, as demonstrated in the 2015 Ukraine grid cyberattack. This motivates us to investigate the fundamental question of how to achieve power-communication collaborative control optimization by proposing a cross-domain gap driven optimization framework of integrated sensing, transmission and control. Our novel framework addresses these limitations through three synergistic innovations: (i) accurate false data injection (FDI) attack sensing based on temporal correlation, (ii) secure data transmission based on hierarchical cooperative learning, and (iii) trust and delay-weighted consensus control. Its superiority is validated through simulations across diverse attack scenarios, grid topologies, and network scales. It exhibits strong scalability and robustness in large-scale complex grids. Key finding revels that blocking propagation paths of outdated and tampered consensus variables effectively mitigates control deviations and oscillations.</description></item><item><title>Self-Organizing Post-Contingency Distribution Network via Drone-Assisted Resilience-Oriented Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142358</link><description>Distribution networks with inverter-based distributed energy resources may increasingly face extreme events. While localized and islanded energy supply can enhance grid resilience, post-contingency distribution networks may struggle with efficient communication capabilities and energy sources owing to inevitably tight cyber-physical interdependence. Currently, post-contingency distribution networks do not comprehensively integrate cyber-physical self-organization capabilities using mobile resources. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a drone-assisted distribution network self-organization framework to enable operational data collection and control implementation, further maximizing the system resilience margin. Specifically, post-contingency communication services, i.e., data collection and control actuation, are scheduled via a multi-drone flight trajectory optimization considering drone recharging needs. Due to recharging periods with no emergency communication services, a resilience-oriented optimization is developed to co-optimize power injections and generator parameters for both static optimality and dynamic stability. This involves a compromised objective function that balances long-term energy consumption with short-term tolerant power imbalance. Finally, the proposed communication-control service provision framework is demonstrated through comprehensive case studies.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Smart Grid Vulnerability Against Intelligent Inverter Parameter Tampering Attack</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11159533</link><description>The integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) with inverter-based resources (IBRs) significantly improves remote management and monitoring capabilities of power electronic devices in modern power systems. Nevertheless, this integration presents significant security vulnerabilities, rendering smart inverters susceptible to various cyber threats. To this end, this paper develops a novel vulnerability exploration method for smart grids against IBR parameter tampering attacks. In particular, a zero-knowledge Destabilising Attack based on Fuzzing-Assisted Reinforcement Learning, named DAFARL, is proposed with the following steps. First, search engines are employed to explore vulnerable IBRs accessible via the Internet. Subsequently, smart grid stability sensitivity to parameter alterations in inverters is evaluated through the proposed fuzzing-assisted reinforcement learning approach, enabling the identification of critical parameters without prior knowledge of the system model. On this basis, an optimal attack strategy is then formulated, considering attack difficulty, risk, and computational efficiency to achieve the cost-benefit trade-off. Furthermore, the corresponding active and passive defense mechanisms are designed to mitigate the negative impact of attacks. In addition, electromagnetic transient simulations conducted on a modified IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that inverter-level parameter manipulations can lead to severe system-wide stability degradation. These results substantiate both the effectiveness of our proposed sensitivity analysis methodology and the stealth characteristics of DAFARL.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Agent Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning for HVAC Control With Flexible DERs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123597</link><description>As electricity consumption in commercial and residential buildings continues to rise, reducing energy costs presents an increasing challenge. Heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, which typically account for 40%&#8211;50% of a building&#8217;s energy use, are prime targets for energy savings. Intelligent control of HVAC temperature through the exploitation of HVAC load flexibility brings significant potential to reduce energy consumption and electricity expenses. The nonlinear models of HVAC systems challenge traditional control methods, while the uncertainty introduced by HVAC load flexibility complicates distributed energy resource (DER) management using conventional optimal dispatch techniques. In response to these challenges, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. The lower-level agents focus on balancing comfort and energy conservation, while the upper-level DRL agents optimize the use of DERs to reduce peak demand based on the control outcomes of the HVAC by the lower-level agents. In the upper-level agents, we incorporate a multi-agent structure based on ensemble learning, which acts based on historical and current data without relying on precise load forecasting to address the delayed rewarding issue in DRL. This allows for the effective reduction of energy costs. The proposed method is tested using a real-world microgrid comprising 413 buildings in Southern California, and the results demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce overall electricity bills while ensuring the comfort of consumers and residents.</description></item><item><title>EdgeHEM: Sparse Federated Reinforcement Learning for Home Energy Management at the Edge</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126167</link><description>With the growth of energy demand and the popularization of distributed energy resources, home energy management (HEM) has emerged as a crucial technology to improve energy efficiency and reduce electricity costs.

Specifically, a dynamic sparse learning strategy with topology evolution is explored to overcome memory limitations on the network scale. Furthermore, a compressed federated learning approach with gradient approximation is developed to leverage the transitions cached in the memory of multiple edge devices. Extensive experiments are conducted on the established hardware testbed to demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of EdgeHEM using real-world datasets.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Network Partitioning for a Large-Scale Microgrid Cluster</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11143549</link><description>A large-scale microgrid cluster (MGC) using centralized energy management faces computational and data processing burdens, making it rather hard to obtain real-time optimal energy dispatch strategies. Network partitioning method can reduce such complexity by dividing the MGC into self-adequate partitions. However, existing dynamic network partitioning methods normally update the network partitioning results at fixed time intervals, which limits the ability to adapt to spatiotemporal variations in output of renewable energy sources (RESs), load demand, and grid topology. To address this, a dynamic network partitioning method based on an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) combined with depth-first search (DFS) is proposed. IGA is employed to optimize the partitioning index, and DFS is subsequently applied to obtain the network partitioning result. Furthermore, a dynamic update mechanism is designed to adaptively update the partitioning results according to spatiotemporal variations in system conditions. Simulation results on the modified IEEE 123-bus system show that the proposed method achieves better partitioning quality than the genetic algorithm (GA), spectral clustering, and Louvain algorithms while maintaining computational efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Tuning Friendly Deep Reinforcement Learning Method for Inverter-Based Volt/Var Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119650</link><description>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been applied to power system problems in active distribution networks, including the inverter-based volt/var control (VVC).

The proposed method is applied to deep deterministic policy gradient and soft actor-critic, two widely used DRL algorithms. The advantages of tuning-friendly training, i.e., insensitiveness to hyperparameter tuning, are validated by numerical experiments.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Ship-to-Grid Dispatch Considering Battery Thermal and Voltage Electrochemical-Thermal-Coupled Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119670</link><description>This letter proposes an optimal ship-to-grid (S2G) dispatch model of electric ships (ESs) coupling onshore and/or offshore wind energy conversion systems (WECS) with shore-to-ship and/or offshore floating charging stations so that the shipboard battery energy storage system (BESS) can help to smooth out variable WECS output.

Applications such as aerial surveillance, search and rescue, and operations beyond the line of sight rely on the autonomous navigation capabilities of multi-AAVs. This paper introduces a novel framework, Adaptive Rapid Recurrent Stochastic Valued Gradient (ARReSVG), empowered by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to address navigational challenges faced by AAVs in partially observable spaces. The proposed ARReSVG framework incorporates an adaptive learning approach to address issues related to partial observability-based autonomous navigation effectively. Compared with traditional obstacle avoidance techniques, the proposed navigation framework utilizes a distributed Multi-AAV Consensus Path Planning (MUCP2) mechanism to perform collaborative path planning for multiple AAVs to ensure collision avoidance trajectories. Additionally, the learned value-action policy implemented in the AAV alleviates the computational demands of real-time map-building. The ARReSVG framework leverages a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to reduce computing complexity and accurately approximate the action-value function. The simulation results show that the ARReSVG framework achieves an impressive 94% success rate, enabling AAVs to navigate independently in unknown and complex environments.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Multi-Ensemble Learning-Based Power Prediction for Energy Management of Dual-Source Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11012916</link><description>Electric vehicles (EVs) rely on batteries as their main energy source, so it is important to take steps to reduce their stress to extend their life and maintain their performance. Combining supercapacitors with batteries can be a promising way to reduce battery stress, while also improving global EV performance. This paper proposes a novel multi-ensemble learning (MEL)-based method for designing energy management strategies (called MEL-EMSs) for dual-source EVs (DSEVs), i.e., EVs using a battery and a supercapacitor. A designed MEL-EMS determines in real-time a performant power distribution. Such power distribution is determined solely based on the history of the speed and traction power, without requiring any prior knowledge of the complete driving cycle. MEL-EMS is evaluated at two levels, to assess power distribution and energy consumption respectively. The real-time simulation is carried out under unknown driving cycles based on a validated numerical EV model. Our results demonstrate that MEL-EMS outperforms state-of-the-art methods by enhancing energy efficiency, reducing battery stress with a 4.8% reduction in battery root-mean-square current and a 41.7% decrease in standard deviation of battery current, while ensuring accurate and low-cost real-time power distribution.</description></item><item><title>Performance Analysis of Interference Isolation in Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Networks With Directional Antenna</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048704</link><description>Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) could significantly improve the signal power strength, while also accumulate the co-channel interference due to passive scattering. Focusing the energy radiated to the user by directional antenna will significantly decrease co-channel interference, which hasn't been analyzed in existing IRS-assisted networks. This paper proposes a tractable directional antenna model for IRS-assisted networks where base station (BS) will generate two narrow beams toward IRS and user equipment (UE) for interference isolation, and power allocation parameter $\omega$ is designed for direct link and IRS-assisted cascade link. Specifically, realistic and mathematically tractable directional antenna pattern ${G_{M,m,\theta }}(\phi)$ is adopted that radiation gain is modeled by main lobe directivity gain, the back lobe gain, and the beamwidth of the main lobe, and the total interference with IRS random scattering is revised. In addition, the signal and interference power distribution is achieved using Gamma function and the optimal $\omega$ can be found, where the different gain of IRS perfect reflecting and random scattering is taken into account, and the tradeoff between power allocation parameter $\omega$ and channel condition can be exploited. Analytical results demonstrate that system coverage probability is maximized when $\omega=0.52$ and IRSs deployment density $\lambda _{I}=5000/{km}^{2}$ and reflecting elements $N=3000$.</description></item><item><title>Joint Trajectory and Beamforming Optimization for UAV-RIS-Empowered Multiuser Communication Networks: A Double Deep Q-Network Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008723</link><description>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication technology offers adaptable reflected beams and dynamic parameter adjustments, proving vital for managing the highly dynamic communication environments expected in wireless communications. However, a key challenge lies in addressing the dynamic and nonlinear problem of RIS phase shift design and UAV trajectory prediction. To ensure long-term fairness and enhance system performance, we propose an approach based on the double deep Q-network (DDQN), aiming to maximize the weighted sum rate across multiple users. Specifically, we employ an initial phase shift and predefined codebook to optimize the RIS phase shift at the current UAV position using DDQN. Further refinement is achieved through an extremum seeking algorithm. Then, under constraints encompassing RIS phase shift, allowable regions for UAV node, base station (BS) transmit power, and minimum user rate, we adopt DDQN to obtain predefined reward parameters jointly designed by fairness and throughput through interaction with dynamic and variable channel environment, and continuously update UAV position parameters to maximize rewards. The simulation results verify the efficacy of our joint optimization strategy, demonstrating optimal UAV location selection for UAV-RIS-empowered multiuser networks in a 2D plane.</description></item><item><title>On the Design of Capacity-Achieving Distributions for Discrete-Time Poisson Channel With Low-Precision ADCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008707</link><description>This paper investigates the design of the capacity-achieving input distribution for the discrete-time Poisson channel (DTPC) under dark current effects with low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). An efficient algorithm integrating the Newton-Raphson and Blahut-Arimoto (BA) methods is proposed to jointly optimize the input distribution and amplitude levels under both peak and average power constraints. Additionally, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions are established to provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimality of the obtained capacity-achieving distribution. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm attains 72% and 83% of the theoretical capacity at 5 dB for 1-bit and 2-bit quantized DTPC, respectively. Furthermore, for a DTPC with finite-precision quantization (i.e., ${\log _{2}}K$ bits), the capacity can be achieved by a non-uniform discrete input distribution with support for $K$ mass points, under the given power constraints.</description></item><item><title>A DRL-Framework for Full-Duplex WPCN Enabled Mobile Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11012917</link><description>As the Internet of Things (IoT) continues to expand in both daily life and industrial production, the data generated by IoT devices is increasing rapidly. To address the challenges of limited battery life and computational capacity in these devices, two promising solutions have emerged: wireless power transfer (WPT) and mobile edge computing (MEC). By receiving radio frequency (RF) energy from a hybrid access point (HAP), wireless devices (WDs) can either offload data to the HAP or process it locally. In this paper, we explore the full-duplex WPT-MEC scenario and maximize the sum computation rate (SCR) by optimizing the offloading decision and resource allocation of WDs in different access modes and energy harvest models. This problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To address this, we decompose the problem into two sub-problems: one focuses on optimizing offloading decisions, and the other focuses on energy power and bandwidth allocation under given the offloading decisions. We propose a deep reinforcement learning approach based on policy gradients to make offloading decisions, and we design an optimization algorithm for efficient bandwidth and energy resource allocation. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm achieves approximately 96$\%$ of the maximum possible computation rate while maintaining low computational complexity.</description></item><item><title>Advancing Ultra-Reliable 6G: Transformer and Semantic Localization Empowered Robust Beamforming in Millimeter-Wave Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11018220</link><description>Advancements in 6G wireless technology have elevated the importance of beamforming, especially for attaining ultra-high data rates via millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency deployment. Although promising, mmWave bands require substantial beam training to achieve precise beamforming. While initial deep learning models that use RGB camera images demonstrated promise in reducing beam training overhead, their performance suffers due to sensitivity to lighting and environmental variations. Due to this sensitivity, Quality of Service (QoS) fluctuates, eventually affecting the stability and dependability of networks in dynamic environments. This emphasizes a critical need for robust solutions. This paper proposes a robust beamforming technique to ensure consistent QoS under varying environmental conditions. An optimization problem has been formulated to maximize users' data rates. To solve the formulated NP-hard optimization problem, we decompose it into two subproblems: the semantic localization problem and the optimal beam selection problem. To solve the semantic localization problem, we propose a novel method that leverages the K-means clustering and YOLOv8 model. To solve the beam selection problem, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid architecture that combines a lightweight transformer with a CNN architecture through a weighted entropy mechanism. This hybrid architecture utilizes multimodal data sources to dynamically predict the optimal beams. For maintaining QoS, rapid and accurate beam predictions are needed. To quantify this, a novel metric, Accuracy-Complexity Efficiency (ACE), which combines both the model complexity and accuracy, has been proposed. Six testing scenarios have been developed to evaluate the robustness of the proposed model. Finally, the simulation result demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines regarding beam prediction accuracy, received power, and ACE in the developed test scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Recognition on Overlapping Spectrum Signals in UAV-Assisted Radio Monitoring Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11010918</link><description>Due to the convergence of new wireless technologies progress and integration with the existing radio spectrum, overlapping spectrum signals (OSS) appearing simultaneously is more frequently and randomly in time and space position. That brings more challenges for radio monitoring system on multi-parameter signal recognition and flexible target tracking. With the advantage of flexibility and mobility, uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted monitoring system is rapid advancing. In this paper, we propose a new framework for multi-parameter integrated recognition on OSS, including category and number of signals identification, position and transmitted power estimation, through UAV-assisted radio monitoring systems. Cooperative multi-layer Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) recognition (CMNR) is firstly designed to solve the problem of OSS multi-parameters integrated recognition. To further reduce the computational complexity and time identically, joint multi-layer NMF recognition (JMNR) is then developed by fully using the data correlation among different monitoring nodes and significantly improve the integrated recognition accuracy based on joint matrix optimization. The flexibility and mobility of UAV monitoring nodes inspire the design of the centroid-seeking flying strategy (CSFS) for JMNR applications. In the simulation, the signal category recognition accuracy of JMNR and CMNR both achieve at least 27.1% higher than traditional blind signal separation (BSS) methods. In the large monitoring area, the position accuracy of JMNR even obtain 11.9% higher than that using CMNR. CSFS also exhibits 20.9% and 25.3% improvement on respective position and power estimation accuracy under large monitoring area and low height of UAVs conditions.</description></item><item><title>Secure and Efficient Data Sharing for Internet of Vehicles: A Hierarchical Blockchain Enabled Asynchronous Federated Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11015654</link><description>With the rapid development of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), vehicles could share their local data through the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) for better intelligent driving services. By sharing model knowledge rather than raw data, federated learning (FL) could effectively protect user data privacy. The combination of blockchain technology and FL provides a more secure sharing solution. However, the current blockchain enabled FL systems still face security threats, and have limited efficiency and scalability. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical blockchain enabled multi-region asynchronous swarm learning (HB-MASL) framework to achieve secure and efficient data sharing for IoVs. The HB-MASL divides the edge network into multiple regions to collaborate and parallelize FL-based knowledge sharing tasks to improve scalability while ensuring user privacy and data security. Empowered by the two-layer blockchain, the HB-MASL could achieve safe intra-regional and cross-regional knowledge sharing. Moreover, model compression technology and blockchain pruning technology are introduced to alleviate the communication and storage pressure of the system. In addition, we analyze the instantaneous communication rate based on vehicle mobility and derive the consensus confirmation latency of the blockchain. Based on this, a mathematical optimization problem for the total shared latency of the system is formulated, and a locally perceptual based two-step asynchronous sharing (LPTAS) algorithm is proposed to minimize the system latency. Finally, comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms could achieve better performance in terms of model accuracy, convergence rates, security and efficiency compared with existing algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Performance Analysis of User-Centric Interference Cooperation in Multi-Antenna UAV Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048700</link><description>Multi-antenna unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks can improve throughput by spatial multiplexing and UAVs dominant line-of-sight (LOS) connections, which will intensify interference and exacerbate user fluctuation. This paper proposes user-centric interference cooperation in multi-antenna UAV networks, where multi-antenna beamforming and joint transmission are performed among cooperative UAVs, and derives a semi-closed expression of the ergodic rate using stochastic geometry. Specifically, a dynamic UAV group with adjustable radius ${R}$ is organized for each user that forms a 3D conical region to guarantee seamless service, which provides spatial multiplexing freedom via cooperative multi-antenna beamforming to achieve interference mitigation. In addition, both signal power and inter-cluster interference power are approximated by Gamma distributions with appropriate parameters experiencing generic Nakagami-$m$ fading in air-to-ground (AtG) channel. Furthermore, zero-forcing (ZF) beamforming is adopted with equal power allocation among beams, which is across the distributed set of UAVs within the cluster and considering different antenna loading. Numerical results show that the average ergodic rate can achieve 86.01% gain compared to the uncoordinated single-cell multi-antenna UAV network when UAV density is ${100\mathrm{/km^{2}}}$ and UAV group radius ${R}$ is ${20\;\mathrm{m}}$. The optimal network parameters are investigated to maximize ergodic rate, thus providing guidelines for practical network configuration. For instance, when UAV density is $50\mathrm{/km^{2}}$ and loading factor is $K/M=2/16$, the optimal deployment altitude for UAVs is $ h=20\;{\rm m}$, which can achieve a rate gain of 144% compared to the case of $h=0\;\mathrm{m}$.</description></item><item><title>Deep Point Reinforcement Learning Approach for Sustainable Communications Using and Moving Interaction Station</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11010909</link><description>Autonomous aerial vehicles (AAV) have emerged as a critical component in the smart city, which can significantly enhance integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) performance. This paper mainly investigates the AAV-to-Vehicle (A2V) communication scenarios, where vehicles are represented as rigid shapes in the radar point cloud (RPC). The moving interaction station (MIS) is proposed to provide the sensing-assisted and wireless charging service for the AAV. The radio knowledge map (RKM) is introduced to improve the communication and energy efficiency of the AAV-ISAC system. Then, a joint optimization problem is formulated to complete the data collection and upload task by adjusting the AAV trajectory and vehicle access. To address this problem, a deep point reinforcement learning (DPRL) algorithm is proposed, which contains an RPC network, an RKM network, and a decision-making module. Herein, the RPC and RKM networks are designed to merge and map the vehicle RPC and RKM into the action spaces. The decision-making module selects actions from the action spaces to optimize the AAV trajectory and vehicle access. Simulation results show that the proposed DPRL algorithm outperforms the benchmarks, achieving approximately a 10.87% increase in channel capacity and a 24.08% enhancement in residual energy.</description></item><item><title>Compressive Spectrum Sensing With 1-Bit ADCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11011926</link><description>Efficient wideband spectrum sensing (WSS) is essential for managing spectrum scarcity in wireless communications. However, existing compressed sensing (CS)-based WSS methods require high sampling rates and power consumption, particularly with high-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Although 1-bit CS with low-precision ADCs can mitigate these demands, most approaches still depend on multi-user cooperation and prior sparsity information, which are often unavailable in WSS scenarios. This paper introduces a non-cooperative WSS method using multicoset sampling with 1-bit ADCs to achieve sub-Nyquist sampling. We analyze the impact of 1-bit quantization on multiband signals, then apply eigenvalue decomposition to isolate the signal subspace from noise, enabling spectrum support estimation without signal reconstruction. The proposed method can efficiently estimate the support of the occupied spectrum without the prior information on sparsity order.</description></item><item><title>Movable-Antenna Enabled Cell-Free Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11018493</link><description>In this paper, we investigate the utilization of movable antennas (MAs) in cell-free networks to reduce transmit power consumption. Different from conventional networks with fixed-position antennas (FPAs), the proposed MA-enabled cell-free network flexibly adjusts the antenna positions in a given finite area. As such, the channels between multiple access points (APs) and user equipments (UEs) can be reconfigured to create more favorable channel conditions. To minimize the maximum transmit power of APs in the considered network, a non-convex problem is formulated by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and MA positions. Then, we propose a dynamic neighborhood pruning particle swarm optimization (DNPPSO) algorithm to solve this problem efficiently. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme with MAs can significantly reduce the transmit power consumption in cell-free networks compared to benchmarks with FPAs by exploiting the degrees of freedom (DoFs) in antenna position optimization.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Hybrid Beamforming for Downlink Multi-User Space-MIMO Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008916</link><description>In this correspondence, we propose a graph-based distributed hybrid beamforming scheme for downlink multi-user communications in low earth orbit (LEO) multi-satellite networks.

Due to its intermittent nature, accurate PV power forecasting is essential for the efficient management and monitoring of PV systems. In this context, the accuracy of meteorological data is critical. However, it is not always possible to obtain such data on a local basis, and often some information, such as irradiance, is obtained from models whose characteristics are not known in detail. To overcome this limitation, this study evaluates five synthetic features that combine clear-sky global horizontal irradiance and cloudiness data to estimate total irradiance in the absence of direct measurements. A light gradient boosting model is used to evaluate the predictive performance of a model using these synthetic features compared to a model based on conventional meteorological inputs, including irradiance. The results, evaluated over a reference week, show that the feature labeled $\chi _{5}$ slightly improves model accuracy (passing from an RMSE of 84.013 to 87.232 W/kWp and $R^{2}$ from 0.888 to 0.875). These results show that synthetic features can achieve comparable results and in some cases even improve prediction performance.</description></item><item><title>Study of Photovoltaic Parameters of Efficient Bulk-Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells for Indoor Applications Under Varied Intensities and Indoor LED Lighting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123166</link><description>Bulk-heterojunction devices with D18 and Y12 as active material were fabricated with an inverted ITO/zinc oxide/active material/molybdenum (III) oxide/Ag structure. Donor D18 and acceptor Y12 have complementary absorption spectra covering the visible range (300&#8211;800 nm). Furthermore, the energy layer alignment of these materials also makes it easier for charge generation and transport. All these factors lead to exploiting the possibility of using these organic solar cells (OSCs) for indoor photovoltaic (IPV) applications. The devices prepared previously were soaked in light (AM1.5 G) and illuminated under three types of white LED: warm white, standard white, and cool white. The intensities of the lights were varied, and the photovoltaic parameters of the cells were recorded. The variation of photovoltaic parameters with the intensity and color-correlated temperature (CCT) of different lights was thoroughly studied in this work. The external quantum efficiency of devices was also recorded. Here, we obtained cells with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.88% in AM1.5 G, which went up to 27.58% in indoor lighting. All the devices were prepared without the nitrogen glovebox and were characterized in ambient conditions, which is the first step toward commercializing and integrating the cells in the Internet of Things (IoTs). IPV, being an emerging field, the study of photovoltaic parameters under varied intensity of light and different lights reveals a lot of information about the behavior of cells. Such a study has never been performed before, and the correlation between intensity and CCT of light with photovoltaic parameters and PCE unveils invaluable information about indoor OSCs. The results of this study could potentially aid in optimizing and developing OSC for self-sustaining IoTs in the near future.</description></item><item><title>Uncovering Structure&#8211;Performance Relationships in Organic Photovoltaics: Interpretable Machine Learning Model for Predicting the Power Conversion Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123139</link><description>Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) represent a promising photovoltaic technology, but the design of candidate molecules has traditionally followed a trial-and-error approach, which is inefficient. However, machine learning provides a data-informed strategy by learning from large OPV material datasets, supporting the accelerated discovery and optimization of high-performance OPV materials. In this study, we use an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model to predict the density functional theory-calculated power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OPV donor materials using structural features extracted from the Harvard Photovoltaic Dataset (HOPV15) dataset.

Enhancing their appearance through color modifications can promote broader adoption, particularly for building integrated applications. Optimizing the performance of colored Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) cells requires a thorough understanding of how layer thickness influences both color hue and efficiency. We analyze colored CIGS solar cells using a self-consistent electro-optical simulation approach. Unlike previous studies that focus solely on optical properties, our approach integrates both optical and electrical modeling to provide a more accurate assessment of device performance. By accounting for light behavior, charge generation, recombination processes, and electrical transport, we analyze how variations in layer thickness influence both color and efficiency. In addition, we examine the effects of installation angle and lighting conditions on color perception and power output. This study offers deeper insights into the mechanisms governing colored CIGS solar cells, contributing to a more precise assessment of their practical implementation across different applications. A color&#8211;geometry&#8211;performance map is developed to evaluate whether the manufactured colored CIGS solar cells meet both aesthetic and performance criteria as well as to explain the observed behavior.</description></item><item><title>Postannealing in Metal&#8211;Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition Reactor: A Scalable Method for Improving InGaAsP Solar-Cell Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11173713</link><description>InGaAsP solar cells with a bandgap of approximately 1.05 eV, which are lattice matched to InP substrates, generally exhibit relatively lower crystal quality and energy conversion efficiency compared with other III&#8211;V compound semiconductor solar cells, such as the GaAs solar cell. This is mainly owing to the challenges in achieving a uniform chemical composition and reducing nonradiative recombination defects during the growth process. In this study, we effectively addressed this challenge by directly performing postannealing within the metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition system. Following annealing, the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and short-circuit current density (JSC) of the solar cells were improved by 38 mV and 3.84 mA/cm2, respectively. The analysis of voltage losses, along with time-resolved photoluminescence results, revealed that the improvements in VOC and JSC were attributed to the reduction of nonradiative recombination defects and enhancement of carrier lifetime, respectively. X-ray diffraction analysis showed a reduction in the full width at half maximum of the peak in annealed InGaAsP samples, indicating that annealing significantly enhanced the compositional uniformity of the material, which was likely driven by the redistribution of group-III atoms (In and Ga in InGaAsP) during the thermal annealing process. In addition, low-temperature photoluminescence results confirmed a reduction in nonradiative recombination defects, further corroborating the findings from the voltage-loss analysis. Postannealing treatments have significantly enhanced the crystal quality of InGaAsP, leading to a notable 32% improvement in the efficiency of InGaAsP solar cells in the best cases. Thus, this study highlighted annealing as an effective and scalable approach to optimizing the growth process for InGaAsP-based solar cells.</description></item><item><title>New Model for Estimating the Temperature and Solar Irradiance of Photovoltaic Panels Based on Maximum Power Point Tracking Measurements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165153</link><description>This article proposes a new method for estimating the temperature and irradiance of a photovoltaic module using current and voltage measurements within a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control system. Unlike traditional methods that depend on external data, such as those provided by complex irradiance and wind speed sensors and equipment, this approach relies solely on panel-specific I&#8211;V measurements needed for MPPT, enabling accurate estimations through a simpler and real-time method. A comparative evaluation of various panel temperature estimation techniques confirms that the proposed method outperforms existing ones, resulting in mean absolute estimation errors below 1 &#176;C for temperature and 4 W/m2 for irradiance. The method effectively addresses temperature variations, particularly under low irradiance conditions, where the proportional relationship between current and irradiance becomes less reliable. Results indicate that incorporating the estimated panel temperature significantly enhances irradiance predictions, especially in real-world operating conditions. Furthermore, the method remains valid even as the panel ages, making it a valuable tool for optimizing photovoltaic system performance.

This study assesses the field-level defects and their impact on PV modules after the infant stage in a hot semiarid climatic condition, which was not reported earlier in any other works. The test methodology involved insulation resistance (wet leakage current test), visual inspection, infrared imaging, and I&#8211;V measurements in the field. The safety and performance tests were carried out for a period of 1 month, and the results were analyzed in accordance with the relevant IEC standards, i.e., IEC 62446-2:2020, IEC 61215-1-1:2021, IEC 60904-1-2020, and IEC 60891-1-2021. The results indicate that out of 125 tested PV modules, 83 (66.4%) failed in the wet leakage current test, 122 (97.6%) had hotspot issues, and all the modules exhibited visual defects, such as delamination, ingression of water, moisture and dust particles, snail trail, edge sealant degradation, corrosion of PV cell metallic contacts, visible cell cracks, and burn marks, in PV cells. For the PV modules tested, an average annual power degradation of 2.46% was observed with maximum and minimum degradation of 6.15% and 1.25% per year, respectively. The failure mode and effects analysis outcomes suggest that the maximum risk level for PV modules under investigation is edge seal degradation and delamination with the highest risk priority numbers (RPNs) (RPN = 360 and 350, respectively). The results presented in this article provide new insight on various aspects such as degradation rate and safety considerations specific to similar climatic conditions and will be beneficial for all stakeholders of SPV power plants including module manufacturers.</description></item><item><title>Computational Intelligence-Based Modeling of a UAV-Integrated PV Module in Icing Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11152334</link><description>Solar UAVs utilize solar energy to extend flight endurance and reduce maintenance compared to traditional UAVs. However, in-flight icing presents significant challenges, impacting both aerodynamic performance and the operational reliability of UAV-integrated photovoltaic (PV) systems. Ice accumulation on wings degrades mechanical properties, while icing on PV modules obstructs sunlight, adversely affecting their parameters. Partial shading from ice is more harmful than uniform shading, complicating PV module behavior analysis. This study presents a novel approach to model the behavior of UAV-integrated PV modules incorporating the impact of nonuniform in-flight icing into irradiance calculations. By analyzing how ice formation acts as an obstacle and considering its effect on the PV module governing equations, this research develops a computational framework alongside with segmenting the PV module's operational curve into two zones: ice-covered and normal. The parameters for these zones are determined using advanced computational intelligence methods. The proposed method enables predictions of PV module performance using trained machine learning models, enhanced by the minimum redundancy maximum relevance technique, under dynamic and adverse conditions such as movement-induced sunlight variations and partial shading. The trained models&#8217; performance is validated through experimental tests, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of the approach.</description></item><item><title>Wireless Sensor Network-Based Fault Detection and Localization for Solar Stations: An Experimental Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11107362</link><description>This article introduces a wireless sensor network (WSN) system that enhances photovoltaic (PV) performance during shading through real-time fault detection and adaptive optimisation. The solution employs five strategically placed sensors and a Chipkit Max32-based algorithm that: 1) detects shading faults with 98.2% accuracy via dynamic voltage-current correlation, 2) localises faults at 95.7% precision using impedance mapping, and 3) recommends bypass actions to limit power loss. Experimental results demonstrate a 27.4% improvement in power output under shading versus conventional systems, with 1.8-s response times (60% faster than academic alternatives) at $23/node (62% cheaper than commercial optimisers). Key innovations include a hybrid series-parallel classification matrix and adaptive current weighting, which reduces false alarms by 41%. The system maintains more than 94% of the maximum power point during dynamic shading, as validated through comparative analysis with seven state-of-the-art methods. This work establishes a new standard for cost-effective, real-time PV monitoring while resolving critical WSN limitations in sensor density and shading response.</description></item><item><title>Three-Stage Optimization-Based Framework for Grid-Connected Sizing of a PV Power Plant System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11130570</link><description>The grid-connected sizing of a photovoltaic (PV) power plant system aims to determine the equipment and components necessary to operate and integrate PV panels into an on-grid system with compatibility, efficiency, affordability, and reliability. In this context, this article proposes a new three-stage optimization-based framework for the grid-connected sizing of a PV power plant. In Stage 1, the $k$-means clustering algorithm is utilized to determine the placement and dimensions of the inverters, as well as the number of strings and the arrangement of PV modules in strings. During Stage 2, the DC wiring is sized to facilitate the connection between the PV strings and the inverters. Finally, in Stage 3, the AC wiring is sized to connect the inverters to the power substation. Stages 2 and 3 are formulated as mixed-integer linear programming problems to minimize investment costs and reduce AC power losses. The framework is implemented using different tools and libraries, including Quantum Geographic Information System for geospatial panel placement, Python libraries such as scikit-learn for clustering, and Pyomo for modeling the optimization problem of Stages 2 and 3 with the Gurobi solver. A real-world case study of a PV power plant located in Brazil, which covers an area of 13 000 m$^{2}$ and a nominal power of 1.2 MW, is used to validate the proposed framework. The results demonstrate the robustness, feasibility, and scalability of the proposed methodology.</description></item><item><title>Smarter PV Single Axis Tracking: A Study on Diffused Light Capture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11141479</link><description>Solar trackers are advantageous for photovoltaic (PV) systems, typically generating more energy than those mounted on fixed racks. However, this is not always the case, when the sun is obscured by clouds, it is often more efficient to position the PV panel in a fixed horizontal position toward the zenith in order to collect the most diffuse irradiance. This study introduces a hybrid single-axis tracking (SAT) algorithm, named Sundelay, which utilizes sky images to determine the optimal moments for switching between sun tracking and a fixed horizontal position. Sundelay is evaluated through simulations conducted in two distinct locations: Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Eugene, Oregon. The simulations leverage a novel dataset comprising minutely recorded $180^{\circ }$ direct irradiance measurements obtained from a multiplanar irradiance sensor (MPI) and images captured by an all-sky camera. Our findings indicate energy gains of up to 4.3% with a 61% reduction in the movement of the SAT system over a month, while maintaining minimal impact on irradiance and movement during clear sky conditions.</description></item><item><title>An Interpretable Deep Learning Model for Solar Power Generation Forecasting in a Grid-Connected Hybrid Solar System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11214301</link><description>Solar energy adoption is rapidly growing as a sustainable option, with solar panels used on residential buildings, commercial properties, and large-scale farms. However, the unpredictable nature of solar power can lead to suboptimal energy generation from photovoltaic (PV) panels. Despite the high effectiveness of deep learning (DL) models in forecasting PV power, they often struggle with the perception of being &#8220;closed boxes&#8221; that lack clear explanations for their prediction results, which fail to highlight the key features for PV prediction. To address the critical issue of full transparency, this study explores a well-known DL model named lightweight deep neural network (LWDNN) in PV power forecasting, along with the application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) tools like Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME). Real-time data collected from a grid-connected solar PV system located in Dhaka were utilized to perform the prediction. By enabling XAI model interpretation, we identified feature contributions and explained individual predictions, reducing training computational demands without compromising accuracy. The reliability of the LWDNN model is assessed using both complete and reduced feature sets through performance metrics such as root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2). The test results show that the proposed LWDNN model based on SHAP analysis outperforms conventional schemes by achieving RMSE = 6.180 kW, MAE = 1.939 kW, and R2 = 0.988. Finally, the model was implemented on a Raspberry Pi for low-power solar forecasting, demonstrating the feasibility of edge deployment.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Wind Speed and Direction on Cooling of a Pontoon-Based Floating Photovoltaic System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11196060</link><description>Floating photovoltaics (FPVs) are gaining traction as a land-saving alternative to ground-mounted photovoltaics (GPV). A commonly cited advantage of FPVs is their potential for lower operating temperatures due to the cooling effect of water. However, existing literature shows that the thermal performance of FPV systems may not consistently exceed that of GPV systems, as it is influenced by technology and location. Consequently, studying the thermal properties of a range of FPV systems is crucial to optimize power output and enable accurate energy yield modeling for new sites. This work investigates the thermal properties and calculated heat loss coefficients, or U-values, associated with the Faiman model for an FPV system using Ciel &amp; Terre's Hydrelio Air floats, located in a pond in South Africa. A dependence of U-values on wind direction was observed, with improved cooling when the wind approaches from the rear side of the system. The estimated U-value components were U0 = 21.6 W/m2&#183;K and U1 = 3.60 W&#183;s/m3&#183;K for wind from the front and U0 = 19.4 W/m2&#183;K and U1 = 7.10 W&#183;s/m3&#183;K for wind from the rear side. The impact of the observed cooling variation due to wind direction on system performance was also evaluated, revealing a 1.7% increase in median performance ratio when the wind originates from the rear side.</description></item><item><title>An Anomaly Detection Method for the Output Power of Photovoltaic Arrays Based on TKAN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11137363</link><description>One of the greatest challenges facing photovoltaic (PV) power generation systems today is maintaining their operation at the desired power generation efficiency. To achieve this goal, the anomaly detection of the output power of PV arrays is crucial for ensuring reliability and safety. This article proposes an anomaly detection for the output power of PV arrays based on temporal Kolmogorov&#8211;Arnold networks (TKANs). First, a dataset of PV array parameters is constructed by selecting the time series of output power, ambient temperature, component temperature, and irradiance of the PV array as input features. Second, the PV array parameter dataset undergoes feature normalization by obtaining the boundary values of environmental information and operating parameters, and scaling them to the range of 0&#8211;1. Then, the processed dataset is trained using the TKAN neural network to obtain the anomaly detection model of the output power of the PV array. Finally, the proposed method is compared and analyzed with three other methods, such as Isolation Forest, $K$-means, and long short-term memory, verifying its reliability and superiority. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated in a self-built PV power plant.</description></item><item><title>Is the Land Equivalent Ratio (LER) a Sufficient Indicator to Describe the Efficiency of Agrivoltaic System?</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192315</link><description>The land equivalent ratio (LER) is a widely used coefficient by researchers in studies related to agrivoltaic systems. Although the indicator mentioned was developed to determine the benefits of intercropping, it has also been found useful for evaluating agrivoltaic installations. The objective of the LER is to describe the effectiveness of land use under agrivoltaic conditions versus conventional conditions, which implies separate production of crops and electricity. However, the mentioned coefficient does not give a complete description of an agrivoltaic system and its performance. To do so, additional indicators are developed. This study aims to demonstrate that additional parameters, which can be used to better describe an agrivoltaic system in terms of its comparison with conventional conditions. The coefficients presented can help assess the validity of agrivoltaic implementation and to make the decision whether, considering given conditions, it is more desirable to realize a conventional photovoltaic power plant or an agrivoltaic one.</description></item><item><title>Efficient and Predictable Context Switching for Mixed-Criticality and Real-Time Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11183618</link><description>Context switching is both a highly utilized and highly repetitive routine in interrupt-driven systems, such as safety-critical control systems. Conventional context switching routines are sequential and dependent on data memory access, which may be detrimental to time-predictability. This publication explores the use of stacked register files for efficient and predictable context switching. Two complementary microarchitectures are characterized: combinationally addressed register windowing, and a novel parallel context stack (PCS). Both implementations enable minimal latency and inherent predictability in context switching. To efficiently utilize the benefit of stacked register files while limiting hardware costs, the heterogeneous interrupt (HETI) architecture is proposed. HETI integrates a small stacked register file for accelerating a dynamically selected subset of high-priority interrupts. Automatic firmware generation is contributed to enable seamless utilization of the HETI architecture. A total of four HETI configurations on an open-source RISC-V microcontroller are evaluated against the baseline platform and an implementation of Cortex-M style hardware-assisted stacking. Implementations on a TSMC 22nm technology demonstrate low area overhead for small HETI configurations and favorable frequency characteristics against the hardware-assisted stacking implementation. A representative layout of the full system with a HETI-4 instance is presented with a gate count overhead of 1.2% and no frequency detriment in relation to the baseline design. The functional performance evaluated in a synthetic case study demonstrates how the HETI design can reduce retired instruction count by up to 26% and allow for 21% more sleep in comparison to the software baseline and Cortex-M style solution, promising significant improvements to real-time response and energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid SORN Cross-Correlation Architecture for Low-Complexity FPGAs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11143590</link><description>In this work, a novel signal processing approach for the efficient computation of the cross-correlation operator on low-complexity FPGAs is presented. Sets-Of-Real-Numbers (SORNs) arithmetic is exploited to build resource-efficient multipliers that are carefully injected into the hardware architecture. By this measure, a significant decrease of arithmetic hardware requirements is achieved. Especially, in the scope of low-complexity FPGAs, this depicts an enormous advantage, as these devices usually only have a few or even no specific arithmetic hardware accelerators, such as DSP blocks, at all. In order to smoothly integrate these special multipliers, additional conversion functions are needed to handle the number format transformation between SORNs and the fixed-point (FxD) data representation. For the evaluation, several cross-correlation-related hardware architectures with different number formats, data types, and multipliers are taken into account. Out of this, the proposed SORN-based implementation turns out to achieve extremely high performance regarding the resulting signal quality. In terms of the resource utilization, it clearly outperforms the traditional FxD-based architectures. Hence, SORN-based multipliers identify as a powerful extension for calculating the cross-correlation on low-complexity FPGAs.</description></item><item><title>An Open-Source NanoController v2 Featuring Microcoded Instruction Set Redefinition in 22-nm FDSOI-CMOS for Autonomous Ultralow-Power SoCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11128879</link><description>The realization of autonomous, wearable, and implantable system-on-chip (SoC) for health monitoring applications poses several challenges, such as achieving ultralow size, cost, and power consumption, yet offering sufficient flexibility to reprogram and adapt the autonomously operating SoC during the course of treatment. Commonly, programmability is not considered for ultralow-power (ULP) biomedical SoCs, since a dedicated finite state machine (FSM) fixes the operation sequence, and instruction memory presents significant contributions to silicon area and power consumption. Based on a previously published tiny, programmable microarchitecture, this work proposes the strongly enhanced NanoController v2, for potential use in ultralow-power biomedical SoCs, and integrates it as a prototype chip in a 22-nm FDSOI-CMOS technology. By implementing a novel microcoded control unit and an automated design space exploration framework, which are made available open-source, the instruction set can be freely redefined to exploit application-specific properties. The benefits are increased code compaction, performance gain, and, consequently, decreased power consumption. In an extensive measurement campaign, a glucose sensor control application achieves 13.1% higher performance and 15.6% less code size in the best case, resulting in an extremely low power consumption of 660 nW (9% less than the reference), only by a different instruction set without hardware changes. Compared with other state-of-the-art small programmable microcontrollers, between 38% and 82% smaller code size and between 33% and 77% smaller silicon area and averaged power consumption could be shown. Based on the prototype results, a fully integrated glucose sensor chip will be evaluated in currently ongoing work.</description></item><item><title>An Analytical 3D-IC Thermal Simulation Framework Using Adaptive Rectangular Approximation and Conformal Mesh Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11098761</link><description>This article proposes a novel analytical steady-state thermal simulation framework considering anisotropic thermal conductivity for 3-D integrated circuits (3D-ICs) that combine an adaptive rectangular discretization algorithm with a conformal meshing strategy to achieve enhanced computational efficiency and accuracy. To address the challenges of arbitrary power density distributions in modern 3D-ICs, we develop an adaptive rectangle approximation method that dynamically adjusts rectangular partition sizes based on local gradient analysis and error-controlled discretization criteria. The derived rectangular thermal sources are subsequently processed through a conformal meshing technique that preserves geometric fidelity while minimizing mesh complexity. For analytical solution derivation, we employ the domain decomposition method effectively to divide the multilayer 3-D structure into several individual layers with customized general solutions. Interlayer thermal coupling is resolved through interfacial boundary condition enforcement. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed analytical thermal method achieves significant performance improvements, exhibiting  $60\times $  acceleration over conventional finite element method (FEM) implementations while maintaining a maximum absolute error (MAX) below 0.5 K across multiple benchmark cases with 3D-ICs.</description></item><item><title>A Block-Group-Based Redundant TSV Architecture for Clustered Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11104085</link><description>Three-dimensional integrated circuits (3-D ICs) based on through-silicon vias (TSVs) have tremendous advantages, such as high performance, low power consumption, and heterogeneous integration. However, TSV faults significantly diminish the yield of 3-D ICs. To address this issue, this article proposes a block-group-based redundant TSV (RTSV) architecture. In this architecture, TSVs are organized into multiple blocks, with four blocks constituting a basic unit for the repair of faulty TSVs (FTSV). Within each basic unit, four TSVs situated at the same position across four blocks form a group that shares an RTSV. This methodology effectively improves the repair rate for clustered TSV faults through cross-block and cross-group connections among TSVs. In addition, we propose a TSV repair algorithm that dynamically updates the difficulty values (DUDVs) of FTSVs. This approach uses quadtrees with FTSVs as the root node to compute the repair difficulty values, selecting the most difficult TSV for repair in each iteration. The difficulty values are continuously updated throughout the repair process to further improve the repair rate. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves repair rates of 98.7% and 99.9% for random and clustered TSV faults, respectively.</description></item><item><title>ControlPULPlet: A Flexible Real-time Multicore RISC-V Controller for 2.5-D Systems-in-Package</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11125926</link><description>The growing complexity of real-time (RT) control algorithms with increasing performance demands along with the shift to 2.5-D technology drive the need for scalable controllers to manage chiplets&#8217; coupled operation in 2.5-D systems-in-package (SiPs). These controllers must offer RT computing capabilities, as well as SiP-compatible IO interfaces for communicating with the controlled dies. Due to RT constraints, a key challenge is minimizing the performance penalty of die-to-die (D2D) communication with respect to native on-chip control interfaces. We address this challenge with ControlPULPlet, an open-source, RT multicore RISC-V controller designed specifically for SiP integration. ControlPULPlet features a 32-bit CV32RT core for fast interrupt handling and a specialized direct memory access engine to automate periodic sensor readout. A tightly coupled programmable multicore cluster for acceleration of advanced control algorithms is integrated through a dedicated AXI4 port. A flexible AXI4-compatible D2D link enables efficient communication in 2.5-D SiPs. We implemented and fabricated ControlPULPlet as a silicon demonstrator called Kairos in TSMC&#8217;s 65-nm CMOS. Kairos runs model predictive control algorithms at up to 290 MHz in a 30 mW power envelope. The D2D link attains a peak duplex transfer rate of 51 Gbit/s at 200 MHz, at the minimal costs of just  $\mathrm {7.6~kGE }$  in PHY area per channel, adding just 2.9% to the total system area.</description></item><item><title>Multiband Reconfigurable Broadband Transmitter Supporting 5G New Radio</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153859</link><description>This article presents a 1.5&#8211;4-GHz transmitter with a reconfigurable 10&#8211;200-MHz signal bandwidth, supporting multiband in 5G new radio (NR). A fully differential operational amplifier (OPA) with novel capacitor-coupled feedforward compensation is proposed to support broadband analog baseband (ABB) with enhanced efficiency and linearity. The linear-in-dB gain control method, utilizing the thermometer code and the reusable resistor block (RB), is proposed to ensure accurate and monotonic gain control. The proposed two-stage push&#8211;pull power driver amplifier (PDA), covering the 1.5&#8211;4-GHz range, employs an efficiency-enhanced on-chip transformer and switched-capacitor arrays to support broadband operation.

Moreover, the matching network is systematically analyzed to achieve the most efficient power transfer and load matching. To compensate for the dc offset caused by process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, as well as the dc level mismatch between ABB stages, both digital dc offset calibration circuits and an analog level shifter are integrated on-chip.

High energy consumption poses a critical challenge for NoCs, with static power becoming a major concern as technology nodes advance. This issue is even more pronounced in neuromorphic computing, which gains advantages from sparsity. However, current NoC architectures in neuromorphic hardware demonstrate limited optimization for static power consumption. While traditional multicore processor solutions that combine power gating (PG) and multiple NoC (Multi-NoC) can be applied to neuromorphic hardware, several limitations persist, such as serialization latency and low network utilization. In this article, we propose a lightweight heterogeneous Multi-NoC architecture that leverages the locality of neuromorphic computing to enhance network utilization, avoid serialization latency, and reduce power consumption. To address the issue of excessive communication distances for global packets in low traffic, we further propose a reconfigurable long-range link design and a heuristic long-range link insertion algorithm. By utilizing idle bandwidth resources in the PG subnetwork as a shortcut, we effectively improve latency. In addition, our design supports global reconfigurability to adapt to various application scenarios. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art Catnap, achieving a 16% saving in area, a 38% improvement in average packet latency, and a 58% reduction in static power consumption under real application workloads.</description></item><item><title>Leveraging IO Pad Protection Diodes for Recycled IC Detection and Age Estimation Using Polynomial Regression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11095818</link><description>The presence of counterfeit recycled ICs (CRICs) in the global semiconductor supply chain is a major concern in the present-day world. These CRICs are less reliable and have become a serious threat to the ICs employed in safety&#8211;critical systems. Accurate age prediction for integrated circuits (ICs) is crucial for implementing preventative and mitigation strategies to avoid unexpected failures in the field. By precisely estimating the age of an IC, electronic systems can benefit from improved reliability and performance, as maintenance and replacements can be scheduled proactively, and reducing the risk of sudden breakdowns. Furthermore, accurate age prediction plays a vital role in extending the lifespan of electronic devices, which in turn helps to minimize electronic waste. This not only reduces the environmental impact but also supports the broader goal of green computing by promoting more sustainable and resource-efficient technology practices. In this article, we introduce a method for detecting a CRIC and estimating its age by utilizing the existing input-output (IO) pad structures targeting sensorless chips. The proposed methodology estimates age by measuring the voltage drop across the protection diodes present in the IO pad structure and applying this voltage drop to the proposed polynomial regression model. This methodology requires no additional sensory circuit, resulting in no area overhead. As there is no requirement for a special on-chip sensor, the proposed methodology can be used to detect the age of an IC in production. Our proposed polynomial regression model achieves a mean squared error (MSE) of 1.77 h, with a minimum improvement of 99.7% over the state-of-the-art methodologies.</description></item><item><title>High-Precision Low-Latency Method and Architecture for Computing Binary and Decimal Logarithms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11095813</link><description>Binary and decimal logarithms (BDLs) are commonly used in science and engineering.

The proposed VLS achieves low propagation delay while operating with subthreshold voltage, utilizing a newly introduced dynamic biasing scheme (DBS). This scheme improves both turn-on and turn-off speeds by reducing the threshold voltage of the input device circularly. The biasing-related power consumption is largely reduced by well-designed structure. The function of the proposed VLS design has been validated by using a standard 130-nm CMOS technology, taking into account process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. With the implementation of the DBS, the delay is reduced to 6.5 ns, dynamic energy is lowered to 21.7 fJ, the minimum supply voltage is 0.18 V, and the average static power consumption is 2.8 nW for a conversion from 0.3 to 1.2 V.</description></item><item><title>A 5.94-&#956;m Pixel-Pitch 25.2-Mpixel 120-Frames/s Full-Frame Global Shutter CMOS Image Sensor With Pixel-Parallel 14-bit ADC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11219086</link><description>We present a 25.2-Mpixel, 120-frames/s full-frame global shutter CMOS image sensor (CIS) featuring pixel-parallel analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The sensor addresses the limitations of conventional rolling shutters (RSs)&#8212;including motion distortion, flicker artifacts, and flash banding&#8212;while maintaining image quality suitable for professional and advanced amateur photography. A stacked architecture with 3- $\mu $ m-pitch Cu&#8211;Cu hybrid bonding enables more than 50 million direct connections between the pixel array and the ADC circuits. The pixel-parallel single-slope ADCs operate with a comparator current of 25 nA and use a positive-feedback (PFB) scheme with noise-bandwidth control using an additional 11.4-fF capacitor, achieving  $2.66~e^{-}_{\mathrm {rms}}$  ( $166.8~\mu V_{\mathrm {rms}}$ ) random noise (RN) at 0-dB gain with an REF slope of 2161 V/s. The 5.94- $\mu $ m pixel pitch accommodates 30-bit latches designed under SRAM rules in a 40-nm CMOS process. Noise analysis reveals that in subthreshold operation, the dominant noise contributors are the comparator current, REF slope, and second-stage load capacitance. The sensor delivers 14-bit resolution, a 75.5-dB dynamic range (DR), and 120-frames/s operation at a power consumption of 1545 mW. A figure of merit of  $0.083~e^{-}_{\mathrm {rms}}{\,}\cdot $ &#8198;pJ/step is comparable to state-of-the-art RS sensors. These results demonstrate that pixel-parallel ADC technology can be scaled to tens of megapixels while preserving high image quality and energy efficiency, enabling motion-artifact-free imaging in battery-powered consumer cameras.</description></item><item><title>Compressive Sensing Photoacoustic Imaging Receiver With Matrix-Vector-Multiplication SAR ADC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165147</link><description>Wearable photoacoustic imaging devices hold great promise for continuous health monitoring and point-of-care diagnostics. However, the large data volume generated by high-density transducer arrays presents a major challenge for realizing compact and power-efficient wearable systems. This article presents a photoacoustic imaging receiver (RX) that embeds compressive sensing directly into the hardware to address this bottleneck. The RX integrates 16 AFEs and four matrix-vector-multiplication (MVM) SAR ADCs that perform energy- and area-efficient analog-domain compression. The architecture achieves a  $4\times $ &#8211; $8\times $  reduction in output data rate while preserving low-loss full-array information. The MVM SAR ADC executes passive and accurate MVM using user-defined programmable ternary weights. Two signal reconstruction methods are implemented: 1) an optimization approach using the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm and 2) a learning-based approach employing implicit neural representation. Fabricated in 65-nm CMOS, the chip achieves an ADC&#8217;s signal-to-noise-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 57.5 dB at 20.41 MS/s, with an analog front-end (AFE) input-referred noise of 3.5 nV/ $\mathbf {(\text {Hz})^{1/2}}$ . MVM linearity measurements show  $R^{2} \gt 0.999$  across a wide range of weights and input amplitudes. The system is validated through phantom imaging experiments, demonstrating high-fidelity image reconstruction under up to  $8\times $  compression. The RX consumes 5.83 mW/channel and supports a general ternary-weighted measurement matrix, offering a compelling solution for next-generation miniaturized, wearable PA imaging systems.</description></item><item><title>An Area and Power Efficient Source Driver IC With Multi-Line Sensing Real-Time Pixel Compensation for OLED Displays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11194316</link><description>This article proposes a source driver integrated circuit (SD-IC) with a pixel compensator designed to minimize both silicon area and power consumption for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays. The proposed SD-IC is capable of driving ultrahigh-definition (UHD) active-matrix OLED (AMOLED) panels with a one-horizontal-time (1-H time) of  $7.2~\mu $ s while supporting a variable refresh rate (VRR). During VRR activation, the compensator senses the characteristics of the driving thin-film transistor (DTFT) and compensates for errors with real-time RGB data. By utilizing external compensation, each pixel adopts a 4T1C structure, which leads to a higher aperture ratio, enhanced luminance efficiency, and improved cost-effectiveness. The compensator integrates a noise reduction dual current conveyor (NDCC) and a dual slope error detector (DSED) to detect active pixel errors while minimizing the impact of panel noise. Additionally, a compensation channel multiplexer (CCM) enables to use a single compensator for sensing and adjusting multiple pixels. The proposed SD-IC was fabricated using a 250-nm CMOS process. After compensation, the maximum current error between two CMOS-modeled thin-film transistors (TFTs) with a 100-mV body-to-source voltage ( $V_{\text {BS}}$ ) difference was measured as 5.17 LSB, where 1 LSB corresponds to 0.59 nA. Compared to state-of-the-art compensators, the proposed pixel compensator achieves the smallest silicon area of  $4442.8~{\mu }$ m2 and the lowest power consumption of  $13.3~{\mu }$ W per channel.</description></item><item><title>A 4.6 &#956;W, 133-VPP Common-Mode Interference-Tolerant Biopotential Amplifier for Two-Electrode Recording System in 110-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11185355</link><description>This article presents a biopotential recording analog front-end (AFE) specifically tailored for a two-electrode measurement system, capable of capturing small biopotential signals while tolerating a large common-mode interference (CMI) over 130 VPP. By leveraging the Miller effect, the proposed CMI-Follower provides a significantly low common-mode input impedance ( $Z_{\text {IN-CM-C}}$ ), achieving large CMI tolerance without additional noise contribution. The low  $Z_{\text {IN-CM-C}}$  enables the isolated chip-ground (Chip-GND) to precisely track the coupled CMI, significantly reducing the Chip-GND referred input CMI. Furthermore, the proposed CMI-Follower features inherently a large total common-mode rejection ratio (T-CMRR) without relying on power-hungry techniques. A noise-efficient common-mode adaptive current-reuse operational transconductance amplifier (CMA-CR-OTA) is also introduced to extend the input common-mode range (ICMR), featuring a linear amplification of biopotential signals in the presence of residual CMI exceeding 400 mVPP, which can be caused by unexpected large parasitic capacitance ( $C_{\text {GND}}$ ) between Chip-GND and Earth-ground (Earth-GND). Fabricated in a 110-nm CMOS process, the prototype AFE consumes  $4.6~{\mu }$ W per channel from 1 to 1.5-V supplies. The CMI-Follower accounts for only 17% of the total power consumption, while supporting CMI tolerance over 130 VPP. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AFE successfully captures small biopotential signals such as electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electroencephalograms (EEGs), even in a real-environment condition with 76-VPP CMI, thanks to its low input-referred noise (IRN) of  $0.43~{\mu }$ Vrms (0.5&#8211;100 Hz). The prototype AFE also achieves 90.5-dB and 102-dB T-CMRR with 5% and 30% dry-electrode impedance mismatches, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A One-Step-Packaged CMOS/Microfluidics Wireless Bio-Analyzer for Point-of-Care Diagnostics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165179</link><description>Point-of-care (POC) diagnostics can revolutionize current medicine by enabling rapid, at-home molecular testing for early disease detection and treatment monitoring. Though several mainstream POC technologies exist, such as paper-based lateral flow assays (LFAs) and microfluidic cartridges, they either lack quantification capability or require a dedicated reader for electrical readout. Miniaturization enabled by high-performance CMOS integrated circuits (ICs) has been proposed to address these limitations, but complex CMOS/microfluidics packaging due to the need for electrical connections remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present a fully wireless solution based on near-field inductive coupling. By enabling wireless power and data communication through a 1.5-mm on-chip coil operating at 700 MHz, the CMOS chip can be seamlessly embedded into standard microfluidics fabrication flows. The proposed CMOS bio-analyzer supports electrochemical, pH, and temperature sensing. The electrochemical front end performs highly sensitive readout from immunosensors, while the pH and temperature sensors are used to mitigate environmental effects. Implemented in TSMC 180-nm CMOS technology, the system consumes 2 mA from a rectified 2.5-V supply. The electrochemical sensor employs a fully differential capacitive transimpedance amplifier (TIA) and achieves 0.24-pArms input-referred current noise and 128.8 dB of extended dynamic range. Immunosensing of C-reactive protein (CRP) and a prototype vacuum-driven microfluidics device are demonstrated.</description></item><item><title>A Wireless Power and Data Transfer System for Medical Implants Using a Miniaturized Inductive Link With Frequency-Splitting Enhancement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11229985</link><description>This article presents an enhanced-frequency-splitting-based wireless power and data transfer (EFS-WPDT) system that simultaneously delivers power and forward data over a compact inductive link. For data transmission, the proposed system employs frequency-shift keying (FSK) based on frequency-splitting enhancement (FSE), which is enabled by dynamic link-load isolation (LLI) and time-interleaved  $LC$  resonance. This approach effectively addresses the conventional tradeoffs among power delivered to the load (PDL), data rate (DR), and power transfer efficiency (PTE). The dynamic LLI decouples the load during each resonance phase, which is critical for enabling FSE, and is implemented using a quasi-resonant boost converter (QRBC) that provides a boosted and regulated output voltage. For time-interleaved operation, reliable peak detection is achieved by a body-tuned peak detector (BTPD), which maintains accurate timing across varying link conditions. A frequency-to-amplitude converter enhances sensitivity by amplifying envelope differences, enabling robust data demodulation even in the miniaturized link. The presented ICs, fabricated in a 180-nm bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) process, simultaneously achieve 60.2% overall PTE, 43.4-mW PDL, and 1-Mb/s DR with a sub-centimeter receiver (RX) coil. As a result, the figure of merit (FoM) for data transmission is improved to a level comparable to previous works using centimeter-scale links, while the FoM for power delivery is improved by  $2.5\times $  compared to prior state-of-the-art systems, employing a single inductive link.</description></item><item><title>A Scalable 1024-Channel Ultra-Low-Power Spike Sorting Chip With Event-Driven Detection and Spatial Clustering</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11185348</link><description>This article presents a 1024-channel ultra-low-power spike sorting chip featuring event-driven spike detection and spatial clustering for large-scale neural recording. To address power and scalability constraints in brain&#8211;computer interfaces (BCIs), the design integrates a compressive analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with a two-stage spike detector that significantly reduces memory and processing activity. Spatial features derived from high-density micro-electrode array (MEA) enhance cluster separability, enabling robust performance even under neural signal distortion or probe drift, particularly when recordings are obtained using planar MEAs. A modified self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm clusters spikes in the spatial domain with minimal memory access, supporting on-chip training and real-time operation with low latency. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS, the chip achieves 0.00029-mm2/channel area and 74-nW/channel power consumption, with over  $1000\times $  data compression. Performance is validated across synthetic and ex vivo datasets containing up to 500 neurons, demonstrating competitive accuracy and robust drift tracking compared to state-of-the-art solutions with much lower data bandwidth, processing, and power demands.</description></item><item><title>An 8.62-&#956;W 75-dB DRSoC Fully Integrated SoC for Spoken Language Understanding</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11159176</link><description>We present a sub-10- $\mu $ W fully integrated SoC for on-device spoken language understanding (SLU). Its analog feature extractor (FEx) applies global and per-channel automatic gain control (AGC) to extend the system&#8217;s dynamic range (DR)&#8212;a critical requirement for real-world scenarios, including far-field operations.

Inspired by natural physical interactions, physics-inspired computers harness the continuous-time (CT) dynamics of coupled spins, massive parallelism, and analog computation to accelerate solving COPs. This work advances the field by introducing Daedalus, a massively parallel oscillator-based direct 3-SAT engine that leverages physics-inspired heuristics within a mixed-signal compute fabric and achieves state-of-the-art solution time and energy efficiency. We present a CT dynamical system with three-body spin interactions and non-linear spin coupling to enable rapid convergence to ground states. A scalable mixed-signal crossbar-based feedback system employs current summation to overcome scalability limits and enable all-to-all 3-SAT connectivity. Relaxation oscillator (RXO)-based spins with dynamic CT injection (DaCTI) improve solution time and energy by  $6\times $  and  $8.4\times $ , respectively, for 50-variable problems, compared to conventional oscillating spins. Evaluated with 1000 3-SAT problems from both the 20- and 50-variable SATLIB benchmark, the 28-nm CMOS prototype demonstrates a mean solution time of 1.6 and  $31.7~\mu $ s, respectively. The measured solution energy is 7.8 and 268.9 nJ, without requiring any pre- or post-processing. These results highlight the potential of Daedalus as a scalable and highly efficient architecture for solving NP-complete optimization problems and pave the way for large-scale physics-inspired solvers.</description></item><item><title>Fully Analog, Multi-Lag, RF Correlators for Code-Domain Radars Using Margin Propagation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11159148</link><description>We present a fully analog, multiplier-free, sampled-domain RF correlator to achieve high energy efficiency for radar workloads.

This high linearity is obtained by employing a 13-level intrinsically linear digital-to-analog converter (DAC) where capacitor and reference voltage mismatches are only second-order sources of non-linearity. The linearity performance is validated across multiple samples and over supply voltage and temperature variation. The prototype achieves a dynamic range (DR) of 102.6 dB and a signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 100.7 dB in a 20-kHz bandwidth (BW), consuming  $470~{\mu }$  W from a 1.8 V supply including on-chip reference generation and buffers, and resulting in a Schreier figure-of-merit (FoM) of 178.9 dB.</description></item><item><title>A 2&#215; Time-Interleaved 4-GS/s 14-Bit DAC With On-Chip Calibration of Interleaving Nonlinearities</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11007650</link><description>This work presents a high-linearity  $2{\times }$  time-interleaved (TI) current-steering (CS) digital-to-analog converter (DAC) facilitated by an on-chip calibration approach. In order to accurately analyze the impact of interleaving errors on high-resolution TI-DAC, a comprehensive function of spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) is derived from time-domain modeling. Based on theoretical analysis, a foreground two-step calibration scheme with low-complexity circuits is proposed to address the issue of SFDR degeneration caused by narrowband locking. The calibration of gain error mismatch (GEM) can be achieved by efficiently compensating for the current sources of each sub-DAC (sDAC) in the proposed GEM loop. The amplitude of the TI spurs induced by duty-cycle errors (DCEs) exhibits an unimodal linear characteristic. Based on this characteristic, a compact cyclic-quantization circuit (CQC) combined with a uniform grid search algorithm is proposed to realize a high-precision calibration for DCE. A 14-bit 4-GS/s TI-DAC with the foreground on-chip calibration is realized in 65-nm CMOS. Measurement results demonstrate that with one single-tone calibration, the SFDR can be improved up to around 25 dB, achieving an SFDR  ${\ge }~61$  dB across the entire first Nyquist zone.</description></item><item><title>An Indirect ToF Sensor With In-Pixel Adaptive &#916;&#931; -Scheme for Background Light Rejection and Floating Diffusion Mismatch Cancellation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10989602</link><description>This article presents a  $160{\times }120$  indirect time-of-flight (iToF) sensor with an in-pixel adaptive  $\Delta \Sigma $ -scheme that controls the number of sub-integration times adaptively to mitigate large background light (BGL) with alleviated reset noise penalty. A pixel-level charge amplifier is employed to suppress common-mode BGL charge, while the adaptive  $\Delta \Sigma $ -scheme automatically selects the number of charge-subtraction operations with respect to BGL intensity to reduce the noise contribution from the charge amplifier. Additionally, an in-pixel floating diffusion (FD) swapping technique is proposed to alleviate non-idealities due to FD mismatches, such as depth linearity degradation and residual BGL charge. The proposed iToF sensor, fabricated in a 110-nm backside illumination CMOS image sensor (CIS) process, acquires depth images from 0.3 to 2.9 m with less than 2.7% depth noise and 2.1% non-linearity in a 10-ms integration time, offering 30 fps with a 50-MHz modulation frequency. The proposed FD swapping improves the depth non-linearity from 3.8% to 1.5% for the depth range of 0.6&#8211;3 m. The proposed adaptive  $\Delta \Sigma $ -scheme supports BGL resilience up to a BGL optical power of 3.3 mW/cm2 at 940 nm with a 30-nm bandwidth (BW) optical bandpass filter, and the prototype has been successfully demonstrated outdoors under more than 60-klx sunlight.</description></item><item><title>A TDMA Neural Recording SoC With IIR-RLS Adaptive Filters for 83.4 dB Artifact Suppression Across 256 Channels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981548</link><description>This article introduces a digitally-assisted, multi-electrode neural recording system equipped with a multi-channel stimulation artifact canceller (SAC) module.

Neural radiance field (NeRF), a type of INR, achieves a high path planning success rate of 98.6%. It leverages the continuous space representation ability of NeRF. However, accelerating NeRF path planning on edge devices faces limitations due to the excessive computational load. In this article, we present NeRF-Navi, an accurate and energy-efficient 3-D NeRF path planning processor with three key features: 1) dual-attention neural path sampling (DANPS) engine uses map and collision attention to reduce the number of redundant batches, which saves 96.2% of system energy; 2) approximate-accurate (A2) core with an error-compensable reduction tree (ECRT) introduces three approximate computing modes with less than 1.6% accuracy overhead; bit sparsity boosting logic (BSBL) increases bit sparsity and reduces the compensation overhead of ECRT; and the A2 core and BSBL achieve a 26.2% reduction in total system energy; and 3) outlier channel bit-offloading core and bit allocator (BA) that offload sparse MSB bits of outlier channels, reducing total system energy by 36%.

The DTC is usually adopted in the FOD to compensate the quantization error. However, the delay of the DTC is sensitive to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, which necessities gain and INL calibrations. The existing FODs can only perform gain calibration or require prior knowledge to reduce spur level for a certain spur frequency. An FOD with self-adaption frequency filtering is proposed for DTC gain and INL background calibration. Spurious tones generated by the FOD are detected using a PLL-based self-adaption frequency filtering technique. The self-adaption frequency filtering quantifies the deviation of the FOD instantaneous output from its ideal output, which enables a zeroth/first/second-order DTC INL background calibration algorithm for reducing the spur level and jitter. In addition, a discrete-time model of the auxiliary PLL (aux-PLL)-based INL calibration loop is derived and analyzed. Fabricated in the 28-nm CMOS process, the proposed FOD occupies a core area of 0.084 mm2 and covers an output range of 10&#8211;300 MHz. With a 100-MHz output frequency after the divide-by-2 divider, which corrects the output duty cycle to 50%, the FOD achieves spur level of less than &#8722;80 dBc both in the sub-integer-N (int-N) and the fractional-N mode. More than 41.9-dB spur reduction is achieved when enabling the calibration according to measurement results. The FOD achieves a 10-kHz&#8211;20-MHz integrated jitter of 310 fs rms.</description></item><item><title>A Sub-7-GHz Linear Receiver for 5G Local Area Base Station Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10943282</link><description>This article presents a sub-7-GHz receiver (RX) for the fifth-generation (5G) local area base station applications. A Rauch transimpedance amplifier (TIA) with a third-order high-pass impedance in its feedback is adopted to enhance RX selectivity and provide higher loop gain (LG) at the bandwidth edge, improving in-band linearity for high-bandwidth applications. An N-path notch filter, sharing switches with down-converting passive mixers, is incorporated in the low-noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA) to enhance out-of-band linearity without limiting the RX&#8217;s operating frequency. Additionally, a frequency-dependent negative capacitance is realized at the LNTA input by exploiting the bandpass characteristic of the TIA input impedance, which helps achieve a flat in-band response, extend the RX bandwidth, and improve front-end filtering roll-off. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS technology, the RX occupies a 1.3-mm2 area, operates from 0.4 to 7.3 GHz, and consumes 105&#8211;195 mW from a 1.3-V supply.

Compared with VSLAM frontend, VSLAM backend plays a more important role as it is employed to improve the localization accuracy. However, the VSLAM backend usually uses Bundle Adjustment (BA) as its core optimization method which is well-known for its large scale of problem construction, high computational complexity and high serialization of data processing, making it difficult to achieve high performance and energy efficiency on platforms such as CPUs or GPUs. Although there are some VSLAM backend accelerators proposed recently for addressing the above issues, they did not well exploit the data regularity and computational characteristics, resulting in limited performance/energy efficiency improvements or degraded accuracy. In this work, we propose VSLAM-BA which is a high performance and energy-efficient VSLAM backend accelerator with algorithm-hardware co-design. On the algorithm level, a keyframe-split-based Schur elimination scheme is proposed to reduce latency, power consumption and memory storage while maintaining accuracy. On the hardware level, a column-folding-based computing architecture is proposed to boost performance and energy efficiency. A loading-sensitive matrix-computing technique with an adaptive task scheduler is proposed to reduce the latency and energy consumption. Further, a recyclable computing technique with point-aware solver is proposed to reduce the memory and energy consumption. The experimental results show that the proposed VSLAM-BA achieves the highest performance (380 fps) and the highest energy efficiency (0.51 mJ per frame) with high accuracy and low memory storage, compared with the SOTA designs.

Pose refinement plays a pivotal role in the 6DoF pose estimation, significantly enhancing accuracy by iteratively refining the initial pose derived from a single-shot pose estimation (SSPE) process. However, this iterative approach is time- and energy-consuming which is not suitable for resource- and power-constrained edge-devices. In this paper, we propose PRADO, an energy-efficient 6DoF pose refinement accelerator for edge applications. Several domain-specific explorations aimed at reducing processing latency and energy-consumption while maintaining high accuracy have been proposed, including an adaptive sparse correspondences sampling (ASCS) architecture to reduce redundant correspondences process, a hybrid static &amp; dynamic pruning (HSDP) technique with co-designed hardware architecture to reduce computational complexity, and a cosine similarity-based adaptive early exit (CSAE2) technique to eliminate unnecessary iterations.

Through the in-depth analysis, the paper investigates a relation between skew and insertion loss (IL), and highlights an importance of wide-range inter-wire de-skewing (IWD). The proposed phase interpolator (PI)-based IWD technique adjusts the transition edges of receiver inputs to minimize skew caused by mismatch components, which increases timing jitter.

The sensor utilizes a proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) current source embedding an auto-zeroing amplifier to bias the BJT core while effectively reducing offset errors. Additionally, this work achieves the combination of the temperature-sensing BJT core and the  $\Sigma \Delta $  modulator, utilizing dynamic element matching (DEM) technique to accurately generate three different ratios (1:9, 9:1, 5:5) of BJT bias currents to cooperate with the modulator for modulation.

The small-signal characteristics and design criteria of the proposed technique are derived based on describing functions. The current-balancing accuracy of the proposed technique depends merely on the ratio between the sensing FETs and the corresponding power switches ( $\alpha $ ), while the requirement on absolute equivalent sensing-resistances ( $R_{\mathrm {i}}$ ) and the matching of sensing circuits among phases are relaxed. Meanwhile, both the proposed current-balancing behavior and the adjustment of phase number will not affect the stability and the transient behavior of the multi-phase system. Furthermore, as a crucial block of the COFT control scheme, the proposed self-tuning PLLs of clock synchronization loop can remain fixed bandwidth under different I/O voltages, which further enhance the system stability. Therefore, in principle, the phase-interleaving with fixed switching frequency can be realized without the limit of duty cycle. As a result, the proposed CB technique can alleviate the stringent matching requirement of layout in conventional multi-phase systems, as well as the loop compensation difficulty. It is verified by an integrated dual-phase regulator fabricated in a  $0.18\mu $ m BCD process. Experimental results show that the regulator can provide 0.9-1.8V output from a 2.3-5.5V input at both steady state and load-transient state with significantly higher performance by the proposed CB technique, ensuring current-imbalance ratio within &#177;1.3%.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Step Down Converter Based on Pseudo 4-Phase Mutual Operation for 48-to-1 Conversion</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11010105</link><description>This paper proposes a two-step down converter based on Pseudo 4-Phase Mutual Operation (P4MO) that uses inductors and coupled inductors to regulate output voltage ( ${\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm {OUT}}$ ).

However, its substantial computational complexity hinders practical applications. In this paper, we introduce an advanced hybrid OSD algorithm that fully utilizes the hard-decision algebraic decoding results to selectively activate soft-decision OSD operations, significantly mitigating computational complexity.

Despite their exceptional performance, ViTs incur substantial computational overhead characterized by high memory footprint, long inference latency, and elevated energy consumption. Current acceleration strategies for ViTs primarily focus on pruning operations or leveraging the inherent sparsity, requiring complex address control logic or position encoding. Alternatively, some software-based approaches attempt to pre-compute and separate dense and sparse matrix position encoding, while hardware solutions typically spend additional time and resources to obtain position encoding, decomposing matrix multiplications into structured forms. Through an analysis of ViTs&#8217; parameters, we found that approximately 91.03% of the most significant bits (MSBs) are either 111s or 000s, and nearly 45% of 3 adjacent bits are identical. To leverage this characteristic of ViTs, we propose the Booth-Serial Skipping algorithm, which transforms the computation of consecutive 111 or 000 sequences into skip steps that require no additional computation time. Furthermore, the 4th to 6th bits of ViT weights can undergo aggressive scaling, enhancing the likelihood of Booth-skip operations with minimal impact on accuracy. The key innovation of this paper lies in exploiting the high proportion of naturally consecutive 0s or 1s in 8-bit weights during ViT inference and further expanding the skippable range through the Tunable Scaling strategy. At the hardware level, we develop a specialized accelerator to coordinate the proposed acceleration strategies. The processing element array in the accelerator is optimized for general matrix multiplication, it not only significantly improves the computation of multi-head self-attention but also enables resource reuse for linear transformations, ultimately optimizing end-to-end inference.

However, the channel expansion-reduction process in BB imposes substantial activation memory overhead, a challenge that has not been adequately addressed in prior studies on LWNN accelerators incorporating BB. To overcome this limitation, we propose a fully-pipelined bottleneck architecture (FPB) optimized for the efficient hardware deployment of BB. FPB eliminates the need for intermediate off-chip memory access, effectively addressing deployment challenges associated with BB and enabling an end-to-end accelerator architecture. To enhance hardware efficiency, each FPB core utilizes 2-LUT DSP, Fused-ReLU6, and Q-Residual, optimizing computational performance while minimizing resource consumption. Furthermore, we introduce a batching technique that maximizes the benefits of FPB by ensuring high hardware utilization across FPB cores while enabling the concurrent processing of multiple images. To mitigate the off-chip memory access latency inherently incurred by batching, we propose a stem layer latency hiding technique, which effectively prevents performance degradation. We evaluate the performance of our proposed MobileNetv2 accelerator on the VCU118 board, achieving an energy efficiency of 120.7 GOPS/W at a batch size of 4. This represents an improvement of  $1.5\times $  to  $10.5\times $  over prior work. Depending on the batch size configuration, our FAB accelerator achieves a throughput performance ranging from 204.2 GOPS to 772.7 GOPS, demonstrating its high computational efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A 0.65-pJ/bit 3.6-TB/s/mm I/O Interface With XTalk Minimizing Affine Signaling for Next-Generation HBM With High Interconnect Density</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11018663</link><description>This paper presents an I/O interface with Xtalk Minimizing Affine Signaling (XMAS), which is designed to support high-speed data transmission in high-density interconnects susceptible to crosstalk.

The wide output swing and high gain requirement of the amplifier makes it infeasible to design an energy-efficient high-resolution EC IADC based on DA. Conventional gain-boosting methods, such as multi-stage and cascoding, suffer from the stability issue and limited output swing respectively. To solve this problem, a foreground gain calibration method is proposed for reducing the gain requirement by compensating the quantization error caused by the limited gain of DA. Additionally, a two-stage DA is proposed to achieve wide output swing and high energy-efficiency, which combines the floating-inverter-based amplifier (FIA) and the switched-inverter-based amplifier (SIA). SIA works as the 2nd stage, providing wide output swing while FIA as the 1st stage maintains the gain &gt;50 dB. A prototype of 1st-order EC IADC based on the proposed DA with gain calibration is fabricated in 180-nm CMOS technology. Operating under 1.8-V power supply, the EC IADC achieves a SNDR/DR of 94.6 dB/ 98.1 dB and  $20\mu $ W power consumption at 921 kHz of  ${f} _{\mathbf {s}}$ , leading to a Schreier figure-of-merit ( ${\mathrm {FOM}}_{\mathbf {SNDR}}$ ) of 174.1 dB.</description></item><item><title>A 0.88 e&#8254;rms 8-Mpixel 3D-Stacked Low Temporal-Noise CMOS Image Sensor With Auto-Zero Single-Slope ADC, Fast Correlated Multi-Sampling, Row-Wise Noise Reduction, and Dark Current Non-Uniformity Calibration Techniques</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11007582</link><description>This paper presents a low temporal noise, low-power, 8-Mpixel, rolling-shutter (RS)-type, back-illuminated CMOS image sensor (CIS) employing through silicon via (TSV) 3D-stack technology.

The existing global placement (GP) methods lack consideration for IOBUF, resulting in a decrease in placement and routing quality. To address this issue, we propose a GP framework, DrlGoFPGA, which combines IOBUF placement based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with other instances placement based on gradient optimization (GO). A policy network structure with multi-action sampling is designed to accelerate the running speed of DRL, and a parallelizable reward function is designed to optimize each IOBUF placement action and avoid sparse reward problems. Then, an IOBUF line-network relationship (ILNR) graph creation method is designed to improve the agent&#8217;s ability to explore optimal solutions, and the graph features of ILNR by capturing them through a graph neural network embedded in the convolutional neural network.

However, CiM-enabled crossbar (Xbar) arrays are plagued with hardware non-idealities like parasitic resistances and device non-linearities that impair inference accuracy, especially in scaled technologies. In this work, we first analyze the impact of Xbar non-idealities on the inference accuracy of various CiM-BNNs, establishing that the unique properties of CiM-BNNs make them more prone to hardware non-idealities compared to higher precision deep neural networks (DNNs). To address this issue, we propose TWINN, a training-free technique that mitigates non-idealities in CiM-BNNs. TWINN utilizes the distinct attributes of BNNs to reduce the average current generated during the CiM operations in Xbar arrays. This is achieved by statically and dynamically flipping the BNN weights and activations, respectively. This minimizes the IR drops across the parasitic resistances, drastically mitigating their impact on inference accuracy. To evaluate our technique, we conduct experiments on ResNet-18 and VGG-small CiM-BNNs designed at the 7nm technology node using 8T-SRAM and 1T-1ReRAM. Our results show that TWINN is highly effective in alleviating the impact of non-idealities, recouping the inference accuracy to near-ideal (software) levels in some cases and providing accuracy boost of up to 77.25%. These benefits are accompanied by energy reduction, albeit at the cost of mild latency/area increase.</description></item><item><title>Small-Signal Stability Region Analysis of Multi-Time Delay Wind Power System Considering Degenerate Hopf Bifurcation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11007544</link><description>From the perspective of nonlinear dynamics and bifurcation theory, this paper analyzes the impact of time delay on small-signal stability region of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) grid-connected power system. Firstly, the differential-algebraic equation model of the system is established. It is theoretically demonstrated that time delay will affect the bifurcation behavior of the system, especially the degenerate Hopf bifurcation (DHB) under a specific time delay. Then, the time delay, the injected DFIG mechanical power, and the load reactive power are chosen as the bifurcation variables. The bifurcation diagram is obtained through bifurcation analysis, which can determine the multi-parameter small-signal stability boundary of the system. Finally, the impact of single and multiple time delays on the stability region is analyzed through the stability boundary. It is found that the DHB due to the time delay variation induces a hole effect in the system stability region. Moreover, increasing the time delay may also improve the system stability margin. The findings of this study have significant guiding implications for multi-time delay system parameter adjustment.</description></item><item><title>Generalized Multilevel Code-Shifted Differential Chaos Shift Keying Modulation System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016925</link><description>To achieve a high data rate while maintaining a low peak to average power ratio (PAPR), a novel generalized multi-level code-shifted differential chaos shift keying modulation system is proposed.

In addition, each data-bearing signal transmits one extra bit using differential chaos shift keying modulation. To mitigate high PAPR, discrete cosine spreading codes are employed to distinguish between the reference and data-carrying signals. Two receiver configurations are designed to balance low complexity and improved bit error rate performance. Bit error rate performances are analyzed and simulated under the additive white Gaussian noise and multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Finally, comparisons are made between the proposed and other CS-DCSK-based systems, which illustrates that our system can offer an increased data rate and superior bit error rate performance, along with a reduced PAPR.</description></item><item><title>A Sub-Sampling-Chopper PLL With Residual-Free Charge-Sharing Canceling Achieving 39-fsrms Jitter and -258.2-dB FoMJ</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11058977</link><description>This brief presents a sub-sampling-chopper (SS-CPLL) that incorporates a chopper-stabilized phase detector (PD) and charge pump (CP), along with a novel low-power, residual-free charge-share-canceling (RF-CSC) scheme.

A detailed theoretical framework models the intrinsic nonlinearities, and a harmonic-based (HB) digital predistortion (DPD) technique is propose to mitigate them. The study explores three key aspects: 1) the intrinsic INL characteristics of the DTC, 2) the interaction between DTC nonlinearity and periodic modulation within the ADPLL feedback path, and 3) practical implementation strategies for HB-DPD. Furthermore, a new fractional spur estimation is proposed and validated through behavioral modeling and system-level simulations.

Digital CIM (DCIM) has garnered extensive attention owing to its immunity to PVT variations and high precision. Recently, a lookup table (LUT)-based DCIM architecture was proposed, which stores the precomputed summations of adjacent weights in memory, thereby alleviating the substantial overhead of adder trees in traditional DCIM designs. However, the efficiency of LUT-based DCIM is difficult to further improve due to the bit-serial input method and the power-hungry LUT readout operations. To address this challenge, this brief presents a BooLUT-CIM design that integrates the advantages of LUT-based CIM and Booth algorithm, reducing the quantity of lookup and addition operations by a half. A LUT compression method derived from computation-friendly numerical relationships is utilized to reduce circuit overhead. Additionally, a negative magnitude-bits inversion storage scheme is proposed to reduce inefficient discharge, saving 38% of LUT array readout power on average. A prototype of this design is implemented in 28nm CMOS technology for validation. Simulation results show that the macro achieves an energy efficiency of 52.4 TOPS/W at 0.9V, 400 MHz, which is  $1.3{\times }$  higher than prior arts.</description></item><item><title>EEG Motor Imagery Processing System Design and Efficient Hardware Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11087407</link><description>This brief presents a low-resource, low-latency brain-computer interface hardware system designed for motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG) signals processing.

Unlike triboelectric energy harvesting in the ambience (e.g., from wind, tide, mechanical motions) that allows for larger triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) form factor and higher vibrational frequency, wearable triboelectric energy harvesting from human motions is area-constrained, sporadic and low-frequency. Such characteristics result in low power generation and low-frequency excitations with long inactive period, challenging the harvester interface circuit design. In this brief, a leakage-suppressing differential-drive rectifier is proposed, which enables the reduction of reverse leakage of differential-drive rectifier by 5 orders of magnitude during the inactive period, while improving the power conversion efficiency (PCE) during the harvesting period. The passive structure does not incur additional power overhead, making it suitable for nW-level power scavenging.

The ADC is connected directly to the current spinning Hall cell by means of Gm-C techniques to avoid interfering with the sensor. By making use of the inherent anti-aliasing function of the feedback compensated continuous-time sigma-delta (CT  $\Sigma \Delta $ ) converter, notch filters can be effectively realized in the digital domain to suppress offset without introducing aliasing effects. The flash-based inner quantizer allows the upmodulated signal to be converted and thus enables digital-only demodulation, limiting the residual offset to that of the sensor and removing the necessity of digital offset ripple loops.

However, smart sensors typically face difficulties in the deployment of complex algorithms, such as large convolutional neural networks (CNNs), owing to a restricted power and area budget. Although analog computing-in-memory (CIM) has made great strides in these areas, a major remaining cost of energy and area stems from partial sums (pSUMs) and their associated digital circuitry. This brief presents Shuffle-CIM, a CIM architecture that incorporates the shuffle scheme and analog non-multiply-and-accumulate (non-MAC) implementation. The shuffle scheme eliminates the need for pSUM accumulation, and without pSUM constraints, a specialized ReLU-ADC design integrates non-MAC computations directly into the analog domain, achieving an all-analog CIM macro.

Although the implications of this result are primarily theoretical, it can still be used in some practical cases and as verification, based on first principles, of the noise estimate. In this brief, we show that the definition of degrees of freedom must be substantially revised to properly evaluate the total average thermal noise energy in  $RLC$  networks with multiple reactive components. By exploiting the state-space representation of a system and the property of controllability, we highlight the impact of network degeneracies such as capacitor-only cut-sets and inductor-only loops on the energy equipartition. As a key result, we show that a correct application of the principle of energy equipartition is achieved by assigning an average energy  $\frac {1}{2}kT$  to each nonzero natural frequency of the  $RLC$  network. Some representative examples are illustrated that fully support our findings.</description></item><item><title>A 0.6-V Output, 10-mA Low-Dropout Regulator With Feedback Resistors Shared by an Integrated Single-BJT Voltage Reference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11177573</link><description>This brief presents a fully integrated, low-voltage, low-power, low-dropout regulator (LDO) that employs feedback resistors shared by a single BJT-based voltage reference (VR).

This brief proposes a new method for BackCom using a multimode rectangular cavity with dimensions of  $49.6~\text{cm} \times 49.6~\text{cm} \times 30.4$  cm, which resonates at 427.5 MHz in TE011 mode and 570 MHz in TM110 mode. A double-sided square loop coil, sized  $1.2~\text{mm} \times 1.2$  mm on an FR4 substrate, serves as the miniaturized device (MD) antenna for freely moving small animal implants. The MD integrates an on-chip circuit implemented in a  $0.35~\mu $ m CMOS technology, featuring a 5-stage differential rectifier with a power management unit and a low-power on-chip frequency generator. The frequency generator eliminates a power-hungry synthesizer by deriving the 142.5 MHz modulation signal from the 570 MHz downlink via frequency division. The multimode cavity as a reader receives an uplink signal of -20 dBm at 427.5 MHz in TE011 mode, with a downlink input power of 24 dBm at 570 MHz in TM110 mode applied to the cavity.

Although related In Memory Accelerators (IMAs) provide substantial computational acceleration, current implementations still face limitations: IMAs based on incomplete SAT-solving methods are unsuitable for verification tasks; IMAs that integrate verification and lookup functionality are rare. To overcome these limitations, we propose an IMA based on Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) that integrates both complete SAT-solving capabilities and high-throughput lookup operations. In this work, clause satisfiability determination and backtracking operations are implemented for complete SAT solving. Meanwhile, the RWL-split 11T SRAM array with 144Kb capacity increased the throughput of CAM based lookup operations. The prototype has been fabricated using a 65nm process. The power consumption of approximately 19.3mW under a supply voltage of 1.1V and a working frequency of 100MHz. The experimental results are demonstrated. For solving SAT problems, this work achieves 100% solvability in the SATLIB benchmark. For lookup operations, it consumes 0.13 fJ/search/bit and 0.26 fJ/search/bit for binary and ternary CAM operations, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Efficiency in Continuous-Time Ising Machine Through Direct Current Comparison</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11184604</link><description>Ising machines, which leverage natural computing, exhibit exceptionally fast annealing and low energy consumption, positioning them as promising solutions for combinatorial optimization problems. In particular, CMOS-compatible Ising machines offer significant advantages due to their cost-effective fabrication and scalability. This brief proposes a novel CMOS-compatible continuous-time Ising machine that performs natural iteration and optimization based on physical properties through direct current comparison.

Compared to a state-of-the-art approach, our design reduces time to solution and energy consumption by  $9\times $  and  $51\times $ , respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Reconfigurable Detuned S-LCC Compensated IPT System With Two Discrete Frequencies for Stable Power Against Coupling Variations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153545</link><description>For an inductive power transfer (IPT) system, stable power transfer is one of the most crucial abilities, but coupling variations can dramatically affect the system&#8217;s output. This brief proposes a reconfigurable detuned S-LCC compensated IPT system with two discrete frequencies to mitigate power fluctuations due to coupling variations. The original detuned S-LCC topology can operate in one stable region. With the change of the primary capacitor and frequency, the equivalent ac load can be altered, which will create a new stable region. Therefore, the expected coupling range of the detuned S-LCC topology can be extended. First, a detuned S-LCC IPT system with two discrete frequencies is presented, followed by an analysis of the working modes. Then, a detailed parameter design process and switching control are introduced. Finally, a 140-W prototype was constructed to verify the validity of the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that the output power fluctuation of the proposed IPT system is less than 5% and the lowest efficiency can be improved from 91.5%% to 94%, with the coupling coefficient varying from 0.27 to 0.63. The proposed method does not need complicated control or dedicated coil design, and it can implement stable power transfer significantly.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Power Filter for Differential-Mode and Common-Mode Noise Currents</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168417</link><description>This brief presents a compact, single-stage hybrid power filter for AC/DC or DC/DC converters that simultaneously suppresses DM and CM noise currents through a passive current cancellation method.

The ML buck converters using flying capacitors ( $C_{\mathbf {F}}$ ) suffer from both  $C_{\mathbf {F}}$  voltage ( $V_{\mathbf {CF}}$ ) imbalance and random switching at near dead-zone conversion ratio (CR  $= V_{\mathbf {OUT}}$ / $V_{\mathbf {IN}}$ ). The proposed 3-level buck converter with input capacitor ( $C_{\mathbf {IN}}$ ) dynamic reuse adopts  $V_{\mathbf {IN}}$  half-split balancing (VHSB) for loop-free rapid  $V_{\mathbf {CF}}$  balancing. In addition,  $V_{\mathbf {IN}}$  quarter-split transition (VQST) is applied to prevent irregular output voltage ( $V_{\mathbf {OUT}}$ ) ripples and acoustic noise due to random switching at near dead-zone CR. Fabricated in 28nm, the chip provides high  $I_{\mathbf {LOAD}}$  of 1.2A for  $V_{\mathbf {IN}}$  up to 3.6V using only 1.8V low-voltage transistors. Moreover, the converter achieves an excellent peak efficiency of 95.2%.</description></item><item><title>Broadband Symmetric Doherty Power Amplifier With Enhanced Back-Off Range Using Multiparameters Optimization Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10979994</link><description>A novel design approach is presented to extend the bandwidth and output power back-off (OBO) range of symmetric Doherty power amplifier (DPA). The traditional single variable regulation techniques are effective for OBO range extension only at single frequency points. First, one phase dispersion (PD factor) is introduced to characterize the OBO range versus frequency. Second, multiparameters optimization of PD factor, complex combining load (CCL), and out-phased current combining (OCC) is used to alleviate the conflict of bandwidth and OBO range. Dynamically optimizing frequency-dependent CCL and OCC parameters to counteract the dispersion effect of the matching network thus enable the wideband OBO extension and expanding design flexibility of symmetric DPA. For demonstration, a symmetric DPA with 9-dB OBO range is proposed with a fractional operation bandwidth of 36% within 1.8&#8211;2.6 GHz. Under the continuous-wave excitation, the fabricated DPA features a 9-dB output back-off (OBO) efficiency of 37.9%&#8211;55% and a saturated efficiency of 55.7%&#8211;66.9%, respectively. When driven by a 20-MHz long-term evolution (LTE) modulated signal with 9-dB peak-to-average ratio (PAPR), the adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) of the fabricated DPA is better than &#8722;50.1 dBc after digital predistortion.</description></item><item><title>FDAM: Filter-Dedicated Approximate Multiplier Design for Real-Time CNN Acceleration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947011</link><description>Video super-resolution (VSR) is widely used in various high-definition applications, such as HDTVs and smartphones, requiring a dedicated upscaling technique for real-time full-HD generation. To reduce on-chip buffers for large-size output feature maps, a streaming VSR accelerator may employ an output stationary dataflow, leading to a large energy consumption caused by frequent filter switching. To mitigate this, we introduce a new filter-dedicated multiplier design for real-time VSR acceleration. We replace costly multipliers with adders, shifters, and multiplexers (MUXes), referred to as unified multiple constant multiplications (UMCM). The conventional UMCM, however, may incur considerable area/power overhead due to the unified topology constraint among different filter sets. To address this problem, we propose a new approximated MCM (AMCM) problem to relax the constraint and an approximate compatible graph synthesis (A-CGS) framework to efficiently solve AMCM by jointly searching for approximated filters and constructing a unified graph. Additionally, we suggest a lightweight fine-tuning method by freezing approximated filters and only fine-tuning biases, which can recover the original model&#8217;s accuracy within a few epochs. Experimental results with synthetic data demonstrate that AMCM reduces the area by up to 49.8%, 44.8%, and 40.3% when considering constant sets of 2, 4, and 8, respectively. Our designs with SR application achieve up to a 73.3% reduction in energy consumption. Experiments with the Set5 and Set14 datasets show that our model with bias correction achieves similar restoration performance compared to the eight-bit models.</description></item><item><title>Personalized Federated Learning With State-Adaptive IoT Device Scheduling in Mobile-Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10963894</link><description>Federated learning (FL) is envisioned as a pioneering framework for the distributed training of artificial intelligence models in mobile-edge computing (MEC) environments. Traditional MEC-empowered FL approaches commonly neglect the inherent competition for computation resources between uncertain user-own tasks and FL training activities on individual Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Meanwhile, these approaches fail to address the personalized reward perception that dominates the active participation of IoT devices in FL training. As a result, both the resource utilization on IoT devices and the overall performance of FL models are significantly degraded in practical MEC systems. To address these challenges, this article investigates the personalized FL with state-adaptive IoT device scheduling in MEC scenarios. We first develop a collaborative device-state estimation method to effectively capture the uncertainty in future states of FL candidates. Subsequently, we design a user-personality inspired degree-of-satisfaction (DoS) prediction scheme to quantify the impact of computation resource competition on the satisfaction levels of personalized FL participants. Building on these efforts, we propose a state-adaptive IoT device scheduling technique to optimize the accuracy of FL models at the offline stage. An FL runtime management policy is also designed to deal with the timing failures of unsuccessful return of local training results at the online stage. Evaluations show that our approach enhances the accuracy of WideResNet FL model by up to 35.96% on CIFAR-10 and EuroSAT datasets.

However, ViT&#8217;s increasing parameters and computation overhead limit its deployment on hardware. Previous ViT accelerators focus on optimizing the core attention mechanism of ViTs due to the high overheads of language transformer-based neural networks. Nevertheless, linear layers are the actual bottleneck of ViT inference, accounting for larger than 90% FLOPs on numerous ViTs because of the short and fixed token length of ViTs. To this end, we propose P $\text {F}^{2}$ A-ViT, an algorithm and accelerator co-design framework, comprehensively accelerating both core attention and linear layers. At the algorithm level, a parameter-free and feature-aware dynamic token pruning (PF2ATP) strategy is proposed to reduce the dimension of feature maps and dynamically adjust the pruning ratio according to the complexity of the feature without complex execution of subnetworks. Meanwhile, a mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) strategy combines Hessian trace and parameter-aware signal-to-quantization-noise ratio to boost the deployment efficiency of PF2ATP. In addition, a cluster-regroup-based weight encoding strategy is proposed to compensate for the bit-wise redundant information of the quantization strategy. At the hardware level, a token pruning module based on bitonic sorters is designed to fully leverage PF2ATP. Simultaneously, a 3-D PE array with reconfigurable 4/8-bit processing elements (PEs) is designed to implement the MPQ strategy and equipped with greedy bit-wise compensation decoders to exploit the encoding strategy. Extensive experiments on multiple ViTs demonstrate the achievements of P $\text {F}^{2}$ A-ViT: 1) maximally realize  $3.89\times $  speedup,  $5.54\times $  energy efficiency compared to state-of-the-art ViT accelerators and 2) occupying a 2.25-mm2 area and consuming 76-mW power in 28-nm technology.</description></item><item><title>A RISC-V Extended Infrastructure for CNNs Through Pipelined Computing and Data Dependence Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980005</link><description>With the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely applied in fields like computer vision and recommendation systems. This growth has intensified the demand for hardware acceleration of CNNs. Existing accelerators are either designed as co-processors or improve performance through extended instructions. While these methods can significantly improve performance, they often result in limited programming and execution flexibility. In this article, we design custom RISC-V instructions specifically for CNNs to maximize data reuse and exploit parallelism. Then, to efficiently execute CNNs instructions, we extend a pipelined vector computing unit (PPVCU). Finally, we incorporate pattern detection logic (PDL) to identify common data dependence patterns in CNNs, enabling the data dependence computing unit (DDCU) to process instructions within each pattern in parallel. Experimental results show that our approach achieves, on average,  $9.54\times $  performance improvement and  $6.7\times $  energy efficiency improvement compared to our baseline,  $8.34\times $  performance improvement, and  $3.1\times $  energy efficiency improvement compared to state-of-the-art designs.</description></item><item><title>LPCR: Information-Theory-Based Low-Power Code Reordering for Serial Links in Network-on-Chip</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10963908</link><description>Manycore platforms have emerged as a promising candidate to meet the increasing computation demand in high-performance computing (HPC). Networks-on-chip (NoC) have proposed appropriate on-chip communication solutions for manycore platforms. However, the increase in the number of cores and the size of cache in a single chip raises the power dissipation of NoC, potentially impacting data communication performance. The primary source of power dissipation in NoC is the switching activity of data bits transmitted through data links. In this study, we introduce an analytical method, based on information theory, to assess data representation or coding methods from the perspectives of the switching activity of data bits and the length of codewords used for data symbols. Subsequently, we propose a lightweight yet efficient low-power code reordering (LPCR) technique, that can be integrated into existing coding methods to decrease power consumption. The comprehensive evaluations presented in this article demonstrate that our LPCR method, reduces link power consumption through reducing the switching activity of data bits up to 13.2%, on average 8.8%, while increases the number of data bits by less than 4.9%, this decreases link energy consumption by 9.9% when applied to the coding methods which aim to minimize the number of data bits (e.g., Huffman coding). However, LPCR does not change the number of data bits when implemented on the Binary coding and, decreases the number of bits up to 12% when implemented on the most frequent least power (MFLP) method. LPCR imposes very low time and memory overhead at runtime. It needs a data array ranging from 256 B for Binary to 32 KB for MFLP methods and executes one extra command to read codewords from the array.</description></item><item><title>GRIPT: Graph Attention-Assisted Inductive Methodology for Fast and Accurate Average Power Estimation From RTL Simulation Skipping Gate-Level Simulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10973294</link><description>This article proposes GRIPT, a novel graph attention-based inductive methodology that enables a fast and accurate average power estimation of synthesized ASIC design from RTL simulation, bypassing gate-level simulation. The proposed GRIPT methodology with features-aided attention mechanism-based inductive graph neural network (GNN) model propagates the input wires&#8217; toggle rates acquired from the RTL SAIF file through the circuit. We examine the proposed GRIPT methodology&#8217;s versatility by testing circuits across technology nodes and foundries like TSMC 65 nm, 40 nm, 90 nm, and 130 nm, and GF 40 nm while training exclusively on the TSMC 65-nm technology node. We introduce unseen and untrained logic cells to test the transferability of the proposed GRIPT model in toggle rate prediction across technology nodes. We evaluate the scalability of the proposed GRIPT by testing circuits of considerable size, like circuit trigonometry from OpenCores, and circuits arbiter, multiplier, div, log2, sin, square, and sqrt from the EPFL benchmark suite, without training them. The proposed GRIPT surpasses the state-of-the-art GRANNITE model in predicting the unseen and untrained logic cell&#8217;s toggle rates to justify the proposed GRIPT&#8217;s transferability for designs across technology nodes to achieve an average improvement of 6.74%, 5.53%, 8.93%, 6.88%, and 7.22%, respectively. To demonstrate versatility and scalability, the proposed GRIPT methodology outperforms the commercial RTL power estimation tool and GRANNITE in estimating the average power of circuits spanning TSMC 65, 40, 90, and 130 nm, and GF 40-nm technology nodes, with a mean improvement of 23.42%, 16.59%, 16.35%, 27.16%, and 28.87%; 2.01%, 0.97%, 0.98%, 1.6%, and 2.72%, respectively. The proposed GRIPT is  $12.57\times $  and  $1.1\times $  faster, with an average inference throughput (number of cycles inferred per second) of 1384.6 Hz compared to the commercial gate-level power estimation tool and GRANNITE, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Heterogeneous CNN Compilation Framework for RISC-V CPU and NPU Integration Based on ONNX-MLIR</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10977050</link><description>With the continuous advancement of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), many neural network processing units (NPUs) have emerged in recent years. NPUs offer advantages, such as improved energy efficiency and low latency compared to traditional processors. However, NPUs often struggle to keep pace with the growing complexity of algorithmic models, which limits the implementation of certain AI applications. Central processing units (CPUs) are known for their versatility, but are computationally inefficient. Combining the strengths of both architectures could present a viable solution to these challenges. Despite this potential, there is currently insufficient academic focus on CPU/NPU co-computing, and few architectures or toolchains have been developed to support such integration. In this article, we propose a RISC-V CPU/NPU co-computing-based compilation framework to solve the problem of mapping from algorithms to heterogeneous architectures. To bridge the computational gap between heterogeneous platforms, within ONNX-MLIR, we developed three phases to support operator packing, algorithm adaption, and data coordination. To integrate heterogeneous compilation platforms, we introduce four additional functions to handle task scheduling, weight quantization, weight rearrangement, and memory management. In particular: 1) to optimize the transition overhead, an operator packing technique is introduced by extending the ONNX-MLIR framework with custom operators, which enhances NPU efficiency by reducing the number of transitions between operations; 2) at the aspect of task scheduling, a three-mode task scheduler is developed to allow users to customize task distribution for correctness verification, performance optimization, or detailed analysis on heterogeneous platforms, which demonstrates the versatility of our framework; and 3) In terms of memory management, an optimized scheme for CPU/NPU architectures is proposed to ensure accurate data access. This memory management employs a dual-end approach with self-checks and a release-after-use mechanism to further improve efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that the framework effectively generates instructions for various CNNs, significantly enhancing the efficiency and performance of heterogeneous architectures. It achieves up to a  $7.06\times $  reduction in code density and up to a  $5.58\times $  improvement in memory usage, narrowing the computational gap between CPUs and NPUs.</description></item><item><title>Flex-SFU: Activation Function Acceleration With Nonuniform Piecewise Approximation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10949646</link><description>Modern deep neural networks (DNN) increasingly use activation functions with computationally complex operations. This creates a challenge for current hardware accelerators, which are primarily optimized for convolutions and matrix-matrix multiplications. This work introduces Flex-SFU, a lightweight hardware accelerator for activation functions that uses nonuniform piecewise interpolation and supports multiple data formats, including both linear and quadratic function segments. We optimize the parameters of these function approximations offline to provide drop-in replacements for existing activation functions. Flex-SFU incorporates an address decoding unit based on a hardware binary-tree search, enabling nonuniform interpolation and floating-point support. This approach achieves, on average, a  $22.3\times $  improvement in mean squared error compared to previous piecewise linear interpolation methods. Our evaluations, conducted on more than 600 state-of-the-art neural networks and 100 vision transformers, demonstrate that Flex-SFU can, on average, enhance the end-to-end performance of AI hardware accelerators by 35.7%, achieving up to a  $3.3\times $  speedup with negligible impact on model accuracy. This improvement comes with an area and power overhead of only 5.9% and 0.8%, respectively, relative to the baseline vector processing unit. Additionally, we demonstrate that Flex-SFU can accelerate training by up to 15.8% through the interpolation of derivatives for common activation functions during backpropagation, achieving this improvement without impacting either convergence speed or final accuracy.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Bit-Sparse DNN Accelerator Exploiting Adaptive Bit-Serial Computations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964211</link><description>Bit sparsity, an intrinsic attribute of binary representation, has been widely utilized in deep neural network (DNN) inference acceleration. Despite the advantages in performance and energy efficiency demonstrated by existing bit-serial-based bit-sparse accelerators, they still face two notable limitations: 1) at the low-level bit-serial multiplier level, existing methods either statically select weight or activation as the serialized object during the design phase, or simply serialize both without considering the distribution of nonzero bits in different operands, thereby failing to achieve optimal performance and 2) at the high-level dataflow level, existing approaches do not eliminate zero values in data movement and computation, leading to considerable energy and latency overhead, as well as suboptimal PE utilization. In this work, we propose AdaS-Pro accelerator for fast and energy-efficient DNN inference. At the multiplier level, AdaS-Pro employs an adaptive bit-serial computation scheme, which dynamically serializes the input operand with fewer nonzero bits at runtime, thereby minimizing compute cycles. To further enhance performance, AdaS-Pro introduces an improved Booth encoding method to reduce the number of nonzero bits in each operand. At the dataflow level, AdaS-Pro employs a compressed format to eliminate zero values and proposes a bi-directional inner-join unit coupled with a ring-shaped scheduler to achieve efficient nonzero workload extraction and balancing. Experimental results show that AdaS-Pro outperforms existing state-of-the-art bit-sparse accelerators, such as BitLet, BitX, and Laconic, with performance improvements of  $4.03\times $ ,  $6.78\times $ , and  $1.43\times $ , respectively.</description></item><item><title>Gemini+: Enhancing Real-Time Video Analytics With Dual-Image FPGAs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10950385</link><description>Real-time video analytics demand intensive computing resources, often exceeding device capabilities. Heterogeneous computing resources like CPU and GPU, usually work collaboratively to ensure real-time performance. GPU manages data-intensive computing, while CPU handles instruction-intensive tasks. However, analytics accuracy can degrade because of the imbalance between CPU-GPU workloads and resources, and static resources in most systems limit adaptability to dynamic workloads. In addition to CPU-GPU resource control, accuracy is highly dependent on video analytics configuration, including resolution, frame rate, and model selection. In this article, we propose Gemini+, a hardware-accelerated video analytics pipeline empowered by dual-image FPGAs. It enables flexible CPU-GPU resource adaptation by providing near-instantaneous switching between two preconfigured images. We investigate CPU-GPU resource control and video analytics configuration adaptation in a dual-image FPGA-based video analytics pipeline. We study and formulate two problems of practical importance, a single-camera and multicamera dual computing resource control problem, i.e., SC-DCRC and MC-DCRC. We analyze the problem complexity and develop optimal and suboptimal algorithms. We evaluate our algorithms through simulation and build a prototype for verification. The results show that Gemini+ can improve analytic accuracy by 25% compared to fixed CPU-GPU resource systems and 88% compared to GPU-dominant systems.</description></item><item><title>MemMIMO: A Simulation Framework for Memristor-Based Massive MIMO Acceleration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10979919</link><description>Memristor-based crossbar architectures have proven highly effective for matrix vector multiplication (MVM) operations, making them a promising solution for accelerating the MVMs widely used in precoding algorithms for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems. However, real-world implementation of memristor-based computing systems face challenges due to common nonidealities in both the devices and the peripheral circuits. To facilitate a rapid design flow and investigate the impact of nonidealities, an integrated open-source simulation framework MemMIMO is developed. The simulation framework estimates the accuracy and hardware performance of the computing system, offering a variety of flexible design options. MemMIMO integrates a behavioral model of the mix-signal architecture with a digital front-end. There are three major building blocks in MemMIMO: 1) the device fitting block; 2) the mapping block; and 3) the performance estimation block. These blocks work together to map the complex MVMs in precoding algorithms for MIMO systems to crossbar-based architectures that incorporate memristor models characterized by physical device behavior. Using two typical use cases targeting six-generation (6G) massive MIMO communication as case studies, MemMIMO is used to model different memristor devices, explore the impact of nonidealities on system accuracy, and benchmark circuit-level performance metrics, including area, speed, and power.</description></item><item><title>Shared-PIM: Enabling Concurrent Computation and Data Flow for Faster Processing-in-DRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10979967</link><description>Processing-in-memory (PIM) enhances memory with computational capabilities, potentially solving energy and latency issues associated with data transfer between memory and processors. However, managing concurrent computation and data flow within the PIM architecture incurs significant latency and energy penalty for applications. This article introduces Shared-PIM, an architecture for in-dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) PIM that strategically allocates rows in memory banks, bolstered by memory peripherals, for concurrent processing and data movement. Shared-PIM enables simultaneous computation and data transfer within a memory bank. When compared to LISA, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) architecture that facilitates data transfers for in-DRAM PIM, Shared-PIM reduces data movement latency and energy by  $5\times $  and  $1.2\times $ , respectively. Furthermore, when integrated to a SOTA in-DRAM PIM architecture (pLUTo), Shared-PIM achieves  $1.4\times $  faster addition and multiplication, and thereby improves the performance of matrix multiplication (MM) tasks by 40%, polynomial multiplication (PMM) by 44%, and numeric number transfer (NTT) tasks by 31%. Moreover, for graph processing tasks like breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS), Shared-PIM achieves a 29% improvement in speed, all with an area overhead of just 7.16% compared to the baseline pLUTo.</description></item><item><title>Reinforcement-Learning-Based Test Point Insertion for Power-Safe Testing in Monolithic 3-D ICs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10972002</link><description>Monolithic 3-D (M3D) integration for integrated circuits (ICs) offers the promise of higher performance and lower power consumption over stacked-3D ICs. However, M3D suffers from large power supply noise (PSN) in the power distribution network due to high current demand and long conduction paths from voltage sources to local receivers. Excessive switching activities during the capture cycles in at-speed delay testing exacerbate the PSN-induced voltage droop problem. Therefore, PSN reduction is necessary for M3D ICs during testing to prevent the failure of good chips on the tester (i.e., yield loss). In this article, we first develop an analysis flow for M3D designs to compute the PSN-induced voltage droop. Based on the analysis results, we extract the test patterns that are likely to cause yield loss. Next, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework to insert test points and generate low-switching patterns that help in mitigating PSN without degrading the test coverage. Simulation results for benchmark M3D designs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed power-safe testing approach, compared to baseline cases that utilize commercial tools.</description></item></channel></rss>
