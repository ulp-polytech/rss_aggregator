With this strategy, dc bias can be suppressed within half a switching cycle under different transient conditions, including ac-link voltage amplitude, switching frequency, and phase-shift angle variation. By rearranging the moment and quantity of SMs insertion or bypass, the volt&#8211;seconds balance of each arm voltage can be realized, thereby eliminating dc bias caused by amplitude step changes. Besides, dc bias caused by switching frequency and phase-shift angle step changes can be eliminated by adjusting phase-shift angle in the transient period. Experimental results are provided to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed dynamic control.</description></item><item><title>Transient Thermal Characterization and Assessment of Power Module With Encapsulated Phase Change Material Toward Overload Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106813</link><description>To mitigate transient thermal surge induced by the overload conditions in diverse applications, phase change materials (PCMs) have been proposed as an effective thermal management solution, offering enhanced heat capacity to maintain the power module within the safe operating area. However, PCM-integrated power modules face significant challenges, including excessive cost, process complexity, and increased steady-state thermal resistance. Besides, the absence of thermal models, insufficient understanding of thermal interactive mechanisms, and the lack of standardized evaluation criteria constrain the advanced thermal design for the packaging and practical application of PCM-based modules. To fill these gaps, this letter proposes a cost-effective and process-compatible overload-enhanced power module by the in-situ replacement of silicone gel with paraffin wax. Considering the impact of phase change transient on the junction temperature during the overload conditions, an improved thermal model is created by introducing the temperature-dependent heat capacity. Moreover, the thermal impedance of paraffin wax-coated power modules is comprehensively investigated by the finite element simulations. To quantify the overload capability, evaluation metrics comprising the optimal overload duration and the overall overload capability are proposed. Finally, power modules encapsulated with paraffin wax are fabricated, experimentally characterized, and evaluated. It is demonstrated that the proposed design provides an additional phase-change thermal impedance of 0.006 K/W with the steady-state thermal resistance maintained at 0.12 K/W compared to its silicone gel-encapsulated counterparts, thus offering a novel packaging approach and a thermal impedance-oriented evaluation criterion for power modules with high overload capability.</description></item><item><title>CNN-Based Robust Harmonic Feature Extraction for Open-Circuit Fault Detection and Localization in Modular Multilevel Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11104925</link><description>This letter presents a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methodology for robust and accurate open-circuit fault detection and submodule (SM) localization in modular multilevel converters. Instead of an end-to-end classifier, the proposed method employs the CNN as a physics-informed feature extractor to enhance a foundational theoretical model by robustly estimating switching frequency harmonic components from arm voltage measurements. Crucially, the CNN effectively mitigates the detrimental impacts of measurement noise and sampling frequency variations. This method offers low sensor requirements, adaptability to diverse operating conditions, and high computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate a 61.3% overall performance improvement, showcasing enhanced detection speed, SM localization accuracy, and robustness compared to the theoretical model under practical constraints.

Conventional methods fail to match the specific fast frequency response (FFR) requirements of the grid, leading to conservative assessment or inaccurate estimation-caused penalty. This letter proposes a peak operation mode (POM)-matching online FFRC estimation method for BESSs. An elastic resistor-based equivalent circuit model is developed to address modeling inaccuracy under strongly nonlinear impedance behavior during FFR-POM. Then, an impedance construction method is developed to obtain the continuous impedance curve, based on which online FFRC estimation is realized by iterative searching under multiconstraint. Experimental results prove the excellent estimation accuracy of the proposed method under various conditions.</description></item><item><title>A Monolithic GaN-Based LLC-SRC With Sub-1 mA Quiescent Current and 98.6% Peak Efficiency for Energy Star Standard and 80 Plus Titanium Standard</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11113492</link><description>The proposed GaN-based hybrid gate driver consists of two types of inverters and achieves a low quiescent current (IQ) of 23.2 &#956;A with a fast-operating frequency of 25 MHz. At the same time, the automatic precharge technique senses the voltage of the bootstrapped capacitor and reduces the standby mode leakage current (ILKG) from a few milliamps to 62 &#956;A. Therefore, the efficiency is greater than 92% at the entire output load. Finally, the soft startup clamping technique limits the peak voltage from 2.51 kV to 620 V, reducing power consumption during soft-start and preventing 650 V GaN devices from being damaged by high-voltage stress. As a result, the LLC converter achieves a peak efficiency of 98.6% and complies with the 80 Plus Titanium and Energy Star standards for power supply units.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Stability Analysis of Sustained Oscillations During the Miller Region for Medium-Voltage SiC MOSFET Power Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11103595</link><description>Sustained oscillations during the Miller region have been observed in a 10 kV SiC mosfet power module, which can reduce the robustness or even prevent the proper operation of the module.

By leveraging data-based representations, we establish data-based stability conditions for discrete-time systems. Then, we propose the data-based method for designing zero steady-state error tracking controller gains to achieve set-point tracking with guarantees of asymptotic stability, bypassing mathematical modeling of the controlled plant. Furthermore, considering the robustness against both the noise during data acquisitions and the disturbance affecting closed-loop operations, we develop a data-based $H_\infty$ tracking control design method, ensuring that the closed-loop system satisfies the $H_\infty$ performance. Finally, we apply the presented approaches to dc&#8211;dc converters control in dc microgrids. Voltage control of a single converter and power sharing of parallel-connected dc&#8211;dc converters are implemented by simulations and hardware experiments. The results show that the dc-bus voltage keeps stability under the input voltage disturbance and the load change.

The proposed system can charge both a high voltage main-battery and low voltage secondary-battery from the reconfiguration of the motor drive and the existed half-bridge converter as dual battery charger. Due to the anisotropic characteristic of the motor windings&#8217; inductance used as a grid harmonic current filter, an unbalanced current sharing can occur in stator windings during charging, which leads to torque production. In this article, a balanced current-sharing technique is proposed to cancel the charging torque and improve the performance of charging. The theoretical analysis of the charging current distribution within stator windings is conducted to determine the electromagnetic torques in both unbalanced and balanced current-sharing scenarios. The control algorithm, which is based on equal current sharing under different rotor positions, and winding-short-circuit-fault, is implemented. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Online Noninvasive Diagnosis Approach for Rolling Bearing Faults in Electric Drive System Based on Motor Radial Force Active Injection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11105478</link><description>Single-point fault and distributed fault of rolling bearings are two types of faults that need to be diagnosed in time. Conventional diagnostic methods based on fault impact or energy characteristics exhibit limited sensitivity in detecting slight bearing faults. To address this, this study focuses on the time-varying radial stiffness of the bearing system, which is highly sensitive to defects, to diagnose rolling bearing slight faults. In order to investigate time-varying characteristics of radial stiffness, the radial vibration model of bearing system is established. Differences in the time-varying characteristics of radial stiffness under different fault conditions are analyzed. Then, the time-varying stiffness spectrum measurement method and the diagnostic method based on kurtosis and characteristic frequency are proposed. Furthermore, the method for online acquisition of time-varying stiffness spectrum based on motor single frequency radial force active injection is proposed, forming a complete bearing slight fault online diagnosis scheme. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed theory and scheme are verified through experiments. Results show that the proposed method can diagnose and distinguish slight single-point fault and distributed fault that exhibit low sensitivity in conventional approaches, and is robust to system operating conditions.</description></item><item><title>Sensorless Active Disturbance Rejection Hybrid Control With Adaptive Sliding Mode Observer for BLDC Motor Drives</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106271</link><description>The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to perform complex maneuvers requires precise control of sensorless motors. However, chattering in UAV brushless direct current (BLDC) motor propeller systems, reaching steady-state in a short time, and physical sensors pose challenges. Field-oriented backstepping control (FOBSC) offers a superior dynamic response, and field-oriented input&#8211;output feedback linearizing control (FOIOFL) minimizes torque ripple and power consumption at steady-state. This article proposes a hybrid controller that combines FOBSC and FOIOFL control approaches with a novel rule-based switching algorithm to optimize dynamic and steady-state control performance, such as fast convergence, improved tracking accuracy, and reduced chatter, in the speed and torque of the BLDC motor drive. Besides, a model reference adaptive system disturbance observer is integrated with the proposed hybrid controller to enhance overall performance and actively reject disturbances. Furthermore, instead of using complicated physical sensors for UAV applications, an enhanced adaptive sliding mode observer is developed to estimate real-time rotor positions and speed and adapt variation in stator resistance, improving stability and performance. The stability of the proposed control strategy is validated using Lyapunov approach in all operational conditions. Various numerical and experimental test scenarios are conducted to find the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed sensorless active-disturbance rejection hybrid control approach compared to the individual FOBSC, FOIOFL control, and standard controllers.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Active-Bridge Based Self-Balancing DC&#8211;DC Converter With Coupled Inductor for Bipolar DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106286</link><description>Although bipolar dc microgrids exhibit enhanced reliability and transmission efficiency compared to unipolar dc microgrids, they are prone to voltage imbalance issues. This article proposes a dual active bridge (DAB) based bipolar dc&#8211;dc converter with coupled inductors to automatically balance bipolar output voltages under any load conditions. The proposed converter can operate with a simple single phase-shift modulation. Moreover, the coupled inductor is the key to realize self-balancing and roles as the power transfer inductor as well. The zero-voltage-switching can also be achieved for all switches under different load conditions. The operation and self-balancing principles are analyzed in detail. The characteristics of the proposed converter are well verified by a 1 kW prototypes under different load conditions.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Phase Shift Control for Asymmetric Two-Input Boost Converters to Minimize Output Capacitor Current</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106266</link><description>Interleaved boost converters (IBCs) are widely used in voltage step-up applications due to their high-power density and current ripple reduction. For some applications such as hybrid renewable energy systems, multistring photovoltaic (PV) systems, and solar-charged electric vehicles, the IBC may be connected to different inputs, such as different PV panels with different shading conditions, creating an asymmetric input IBC. For asymmetric IBCs, the standard phase shift angle of 360&#176; divided by the number of phases does not minimize output capacitor current and voltage ripple. While prior approaches have suggested complex optimization search algorithms to solve this problem, this article is the first to propose an analytical phase shift calculation method for a two-input asymmetrical IBC that lowers output capacitor root mean square (rms) current. The proposed method is simple and fast, with low computational requirements, and allows for real-time phase shift adjustments with minimal control system overhead. Extensive simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed analytical method effectively reduces rms current by up to 67.2%, validating its performance across a wide range of voltage and current operating conditions.</description></item><item><title>Planar Rogowski Coil Based Short-Circuit Detection and Partial Open-Circuit Recovery of the Resonant Capacitor in Series-Resonant DC Transformers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11097890</link><description>The 10 kW Series-Resonant DC Transformer (SR-DCX) enables both switch and resonant element count reduction and is a building block of a bidirectional two-stage dc&#8211;dc converter for 600&#8211;28 V MIL-PRF-GCS600 A and MIL-STD-704F compliant applications. The dc&#8211;dc converter is constructed with its first stage as a buck converter and the second stage as the SR-DCX. Failure mode assessment of the SR-DCX indicates a single-point failure on the resonant capacitor that will either prohibit or degrade the operation of the dc&#8211;dc converter, depending upon the failure mode. This article discusses the design of a planar Rogowski coil in accordance with MIL-PRF-31032 and its signal chain optimization for the measurement of ac current on the high-frequency link. We introduce a novel failure detection method to simultaneously identify both partial open-circuit (OC) and short-circuit failures in the resonant capacitor network by re-purposing the ac link current measurement, conventionally used for over-current protection. The method also enables recovery from partial OC failures to restore normal operation. The proposed scheme aids in raising system-level warnings for redundancy activation prior to catastrophic failures in the dc&#8211;dc converter for high-reliability applications.</description></item><item><title>Novel Quasi-Resonant Parameter Optimization Method of LCC&#8211;LCC Compensated IPT Systems With Wide Output Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11098859</link><description>In this article, a novel nonresonant LCC&#8211;LCC topology modeling and quasi-resonant parameter optimization method is proposed for inductive power transfer (IPT) systems. The new characteristics of nonresonant LCC&#8211;LCC topology are revealed and its modeling method using a variable resistor for battery load is presented. Wide-range power regulation is achieved directly through parameter configuration without additional circuit transformers, and the system maintains the zero-voltage switching (ZVS) condition with approximate constant current output characteristics. In addition, the lower limit for the detuning ratio coefficient and the widening of the detuning parameters selection are realized by magnetic integration design. Compared with existing traditional resonant parameter configuration methods, the proposed method aims to improve the overall performance of multiple working points within the quasi-resonant range, achieving a new effect of high ZVS robustness, wide parameter configuration range, and improved power transfer capability. The detailed design process of quasi-resonant parameters and integrated magnetic coupler are given. A 6.5-kW power level prototype is implemented to validate the proposed method. Experimental results show that within the designed quasi-resonant range, a 96.9% increase from 3.3 kW to 6.5 kW in output power is achieved under a constant proximity resonance state. The efficiency reaches 92.4% .</description></item><item><title>A Reconfigurable Multiresonant Switched-Capacitor Converter for 48 V Data Center Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106733</link><description>In the emerging two-stage architecture of 48 V data center power systems, the wide voltage range of backup batteries (36&#8211;60 V) leads to significant fluctuations in intermediate bus voltages when transmitted through fixed-gain intermediate bus converters (IBCs). To address this, a reconfigurable IBC based on multiresonant switched capacitors (SCs) is proposed in this article, achieving both 8:1 and 6:1 conversion ratios to suppress intermediate bus voltage fluctuations. The proposed topology combines a 2:1 SC with two 4:1 Fibonacci SCs, eliminating decoupling capacitors while reducing two switches. Two modulation modes with zero-current switching are described, and their corresponding component stresses are analyzed. Utilizing a two-phase output structure, the converter demonstrates low output impedance, which is estimated, decomposed, and discussed. Phase expansion can further reduce output impedance or enable dual-port outputs for dual intermediate buses. An experimental prototype with a 36&#8211;60 V input and 5.625&#8211;7.5 V output was implemented, achieving a nominal power density of 2266 W/in3 and a peak efficiency of 98.8% in 8:1 mode (3021 W/in3 and 99.1% in 6:1 mode). The reconfiguration capabilities of the proposed converter are also demonstrated.</description></item><item><title>A System Model for the Effect of Self-Balancing in Multiactive Bridge Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11121594</link><description>This article analyzes the effects of self-balancing in multiactive bridge converters. Therefore, it proposes a time-domain approach to model the dynamics of multiwinding transformer-based multilevel dc/dc converter, including self-balancing. In previous research, multiwinding transformers have been modeled using average-based power transfer models. These models, while simple, have no direct intuitive interpretation. Furthermore, they only include power transfer resulting from external phase shift between models, not taking the internal balancing of the shared magnetic core into account. In this article, a dc/dc converter model that includes the transformer as $M$-port network with magnetization and stray inductance and conduction losses is proposed. The model is verified using experiments showing both accurate predictions of both, circulating currents within each module and load currents affecting multiple modules. Furthermore, the effect of self-balancing is shown and how the model is capable to predict changes in the output voltage due to external loads. The model is also used to analyze the robustness of self-balancing to design parameter uncertainties.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing the Voltage-Support Capabilities of Grid-Feeding Inverters in an Islanded Microgrid Under a Short Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11098721</link><description>Nowadays, an islanded microgrid based exclusively on power electronic converters is a feasible scenario, in which one power converter is configured in grid-forming mode and the other converters in grid-feeding mode. In the event of a short circuit, the grid-forming inverter typically employs a virtual output resistor to limit the maximum current, which results in a voltage sag across the entire system. In this scenario, grid-feeding converters have the potential to follow conventional grid protocols during voltage sags. However, it remains unclear whether these protocols represent the best solution for voltage support in an islanded microgrid. This work proposes a methodology for analyzing the faulted system in the complex-valued domain, which produces a large signal linear model. Based on this analysis, a voltage support control scheme for the grid-feeding converters is then proposed. Finally, control parameters are derived to guarantee system stability. Selected experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Small-Signal Charge Model for Active Balancing of Flying Capacitor Multilevel Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106288</link><description>This article presents methods for modeling capacitor voltage dynamics in the Flying Capacitor Multilevel (FCML) converter and closed-loop control techniques for regulating the capacitor voltages to their nominal balanced values. A small-signal plant model is derived by studying the open-loop capacitor voltage dynamics using a linear-ripple model of the inductor current. Perturbations to the switching signals acting as control inputs are defined, and their impacts on the average currents flowing into the flying capacitors are identified. Unlike prior works based on averaging, the proposed plant models accurately capture the impact of the inductor current ripple on the average capacitor currents and yield valid models of capacitor voltage dynamics at light-load conditions. Using the proposed control inputs, the small-signal system is shown to be completely controllable, and a state-feedback controller is presented to damp the natural capacitor voltage oscillation. Plant models and controller structures are presented for all three operating modes of the four-level FCML converter. Experimental measurements of a hardware prototype verify the presented open- and closed-loop models. The capacitor voltage responses to supply voltage step-transients significantly improve with the proposed active balancing controller across the full load range.</description></item><item><title>Power Decoupling Control of Single-Phase Differential Cuk Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11098745</link><description>The single-phase differential Cuk inverter (DCI) is a single-stage inverter that offers numerous benefits over other single-stage topologies, making it a promising solution in new energy applications. However, the second-order ripple power inherent in its dc side seriously affects the performance of the system and restricts the application of the DCI. To address this issue, this study presents a novel automatic power decoupling (APD) control method for the DCI. It directly regulates the input current through a feedback linearization-based decoupling control strategy. An impedance-based stability analysis is performed on the DCI under the proposed APD control method. A hardware prototype is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed APD strategy effectively suppresses 97.8% of the second-order ripple in the input current and improves the system efficiency by approximately 2.8%.</description></item><item><title>Direct Charge Control for a Dual-Bridge Series Resonant Converter in the Half-Cycle Discontinuous Conduction Mode</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11105526</link><description>The half-cycle discontinuous conduction mode (HC-DCM) of a dual-bridge series resonant converter (DBSRC) has the advantages of small transient oscillations and zero-current-switching because the inductor current can return to and remain zero in every half-switching cycle. However, due to the inductor current&#8217;s segmented and nonlinear characteristics, the modeling and control of DBSRC in HC-DCM is challenging. To address the challenge, this article proposes a charge quantity model (CQM) for DBSRC. The proposed model represents a simple first-order linear model that uses the charge flowing through the resonant inductor as control variable. In addition, based on CQM, a direct charge control (DCC) method is developed, which simplifies the analysis and design process of a closed-loop system. During the control process, changes in the charge quantity inevitably cause an undesirable transient process. Therefore, to suppress the transient process, a transient process compensation (TPC) method is introduced, which can reduce overshoot and shorten the settling time, thereby improving the dynamic performance of closed-loop control. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulation and experiments. Compared with the existing studies, the CQM constructed in this article has lower complexity and the proposed DCC with TPC method can achieve better dynamic performance.</description></item><item><title>Efficiency-Oriented Multiobjective Modulation Optimization for the Dual Active Bridge Converter Using Fuzzy Logic-Aided Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11095846</link><description>As a key component in modern power systems, dual active bridge bidirectional dc&#8211;dc converters should maintain high efficiency across the full power range. Existing optimization strategies typically focus on single-objective approaches&#8212;such as minimizing peak current, RMS current, or backflow power&#8212;to improve efficiency. However, optimizing a single efficiency-related parameter does not necessarily maintain optimal efficiency across the entire power range. While minimizing power losses directly depends on an accurate power loss model, which requires recalibration whenever system components change. To address these limitations, this study formulates an efficiency-oriented multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) by incorporating multiple efficiency-related factors as objectives while considering soft-switching and mode boundaries as constraints. An offline two-step strategy is proposed to solve this MOP. First, the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm by decomposition is employed to generate a Pareto front surface. Second, a fuzzy inference system-aided approach is introduced to identify the optimal efficiency point on the Pareto front. The optimal phase shift parameters for different voltage gains and transmission power levels are then stored in a lookup table for real-time implementation. The proposed multiobjective optimization strategy is validated through both power loss analysis and experiments, demonstrating efficiency improvements across the entire power range. Compared to other methods, the maximum efficiency improvement is observed at 80% of the maximum power point, increasing from 90.9% to 93.1% when the input voltage is 200 V, and the output voltage is 180 V.</description></item><item><title>Low Profile Superparamagnetic Inductor for Portable Electronics Power Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11105508</link><description>This article primarily aims for a high-efficiency and high-power-density power management from the USB-C port to the battery within the next generation portable electronic devices. The hypothesis is that by employing superparamagnetic nanoparticles material, which has high permeability and negligible hysteresis loss, the high-frequency inductor design can be very efficient. Therefore, first, the new core material is characterized in terms of permeability and core loss. A dedicated circuit with mutual inductance compensation is used. The relative permeability at 1 MHz is found to be 12 and the Steinmetz parameters for core loss are $\alpha =1.19$, $\beta =1.99$, and $k_\text {SE}=2353$ for result in W/m$^{3}$ at 1&#8211;10 MHz. The permeability change with frequency is highlighted. Considering the fabrication constraint, two coupled inductor structures are analyzed. Due to the very low permeability level, 3-D finite element method (FEM) is used to obtain accurate inductance and coupling factor. The core loss, winding loss, and thermal models are incorporated into the inductor design. After optimization, a prototype is built and tested at 3.5 MHz featuring 84.9% nominal efficiency and 1049 W/in$^{3}$ power density. It can deliver up to 6 A at 4 V output for battery charging. The integrated inductor has a very low profile of only 1 mm height and 90 mm$^{2}$ area.</description></item><item><title>Reliable Detection of Armature Fault in Brushless Exciters With m-Phase Toroidal Winding Using Search-Coil Voltage and Field Current Signature Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11105510</link><description>In the operation of nuclear power plants, the fast, sensitive, and reliable diagnosis of rotating armature winding short circuit (AWSC) faults in m-phase toroidal brushless exciters (mPTBEs) is crucial. Traditional diagnosis approaches based on stator field current signature analysis (FCSA) are widely used on site due to their noninvasive nature. However, on-site operational experience has shown that this method may be influenced by fault transient processes and interference from the excitation current. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel AWSC fault diagnosis method that integrates a search coil (SC) and field current. By combining the ability of SC to capture spatial fractional magnetic field changes, the comprehensive fault characteristics can be obtained. To ensure immunity to field current interference, a blocking criterion is presented based on the ratio of fractional harmonics to integer harmonics in the SC electromotive force (EMF). Additionally, a criterion for abnormal operation based on the fault EMF features is also presented to assist FCSA in rapid diagnosis and sensitive warning. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through experiments on an 11-phase prototype, which demonstrates that the combination of FCSA and SC can effectively improve the diagnosis performance of AWSC faults.</description></item><item><title>Exploring the Inherent Fault-Tolerance of Model-Free Predictive Control in Three-Level T-Type Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106724</link><description>Fault-tolerant control (FTC) improves the reliability of three-level T-type converters under open-circuit faults in power devices. However, existing FTC methods rely on comprehensive and precise fault diagnosis, which significantly increases the complexity of diagnostic algorithms and limits their adaptability. To address this issue, this work proposes a highly adaptive FTC method based on model-free predictive control using an ultra-local model. The proposed approach dynamically estimates model disturbances caused by faults by employing a neural network observer. This eliminates the need for additional control variations due to different fault scenarios, and thus enables a unified control strategy. Furthermore, this method only requires the prior identification of vertical device faults without the need to diagnose horizontal devices or pinpoint specific faulty components, thereby reducing the complexity of fault diagnosis. Comparative experiments validate the proposed method&#8217;s adaptive fault-tolerant performance and robustness against filter parameter variations under various fault conditions.</description></item><item><title>Mutual Inductance and Output Voltage Estimation From Transmitter Side of Wireless Power Transfer by Utilizing Reflected Third-Order Harmonics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106916</link><description>This article presents a real-time transmitter (Tx) side output voltage estimation method of a series-series compensated wireless power transfer (WPT) system by utilizing the reflected third-order harmonics generated by the receiver (Rx). The phase-shifted angle of the Tx inverter is set at 60&#176; to eliminate the third-order harmonic voltage generated by the Tx. A thorough theoretical analysis is carried out, and a closed-form equation is derived to show the relationship between mutual inductance, fundamental and third-order harmonics, and other circuit parameters. The output voltage is further derived. The mutual inductance and output voltage are calculated using a digital signal processor after the magnitudes of the fundamental and third-order harmonic voltages of the Tx tuning capacitor are measured. A practical prototype is built, and the experimental results show the estimation errors of less than 3.1% for mutual inductance and output voltage under the wide variations of the coupling coefficient from 0.2 to 0.6 and the load resistance from 10 to 80 &#937;, with an estimation delay of less than 1 ms.</description></item><item><title>An Interleaved Soft-Switching Bidirectional Converter for EV Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123779</link><description>This article presents an interleaved unbalanced capacitor voltage bidirectional soft-switching dc&#8211;dc converter to achieve a wide soft-switching range and high-power density for electric vehicles applications. In the proposed circuit, an auxiliary circuit comprising back-to-back switches and small auxiliary inductors are connected to the mid-node of switch leg to facilitate soft-switching. By properly designing the auxiliary loop, the converter achieves zero voltage switching and zero current switching conditions for the semiconductor switches across the entire load range. This technique effectively mitigates issues related to high dv/dt, diode reverse recovery, and switching losses in bidirectional dc&#8211;dc converters. Furthermore, an interphase transformer is integrated into the power loop, elevating the equivalent frequency of voltage/current ripples and minimizing power loop current ripples with a compact magnetic component, which improves power density. Finally, a 200 kHz, 5 kW prototype has been built and tested in the lab. The experimental power density (7.31 kW/kg or 18.21 kW/L) and efficiency (98.7% at full power load) achieved by the prototype confirm its viability in critical electric vehicle applications.</description></item><item><title>Model-Guided Modulation for Matrix-Type AC-DC DAB Converter Considering AC-Side Capacitor Voltage Ripple</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11107307</link><description>The matrix-type ac-dc dual-active-bridge converter is a promising topology for single-stage ac-dc power conversion, recognized for its high power density, reliability, and efficiency. This converter uses small capacitance for the ac-side filter, typically ranging from a few to a dozen microfarads, to achieve a high power factor (PF) and optimize both power density and cost. However, the relatively small ac-side capacitance can cause noticeable capacitor voltage ripple during the switching cycle. This article presents a time-domain steady-state model to accurately characterize the steady-state behavior of the converter. The analysis reveals that the ac-side capacitor voltage ripple can substantially impact the performance of the converter, particularly by causing the front-end circuit to lose zero voltage switching (ZVS), thereby reducing efficiency and worsening electromagnetic interference issues. The steady-state model is then used in an optimized modulation strategy to determine the optimal control variables to ensure ZVS operation, realize PF correction, and enhance efficiency. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the theoretical analysis and validate the findings.

Firstly, the magnetized Dickson charge pump inverter (MDCPI) is presented, producing a higher voltage gain with fewer components than its counterparts. Unlike conventional magnetically coupled impedance source networks, the suggested structure provides a substantial voltage boost at a meager shoot-through duty ratio range of 0 to 10%. Thus, it offers a high step-up ability with high modulation index and smaller number of winding turns. Hence, the proposed inverter can be an excellent choice for applications with space constraints where the high output voltage, high power quality, and fewer components are the main issues. However, in addition to drawing discontinuous input current from the dc source, the topology requires tight magnetic coupling to reduce the effect of the leakage inductance. In order to address the aforementioned drawbacks, an improved MDCPI (IMDCPI) is proposed. Although the IMDCPI employs more passive components, it delivers a higher output voltage with reduced dc-link voltage spikes across the inverter bridge. Compared with the existing voltage multipliers such as Dickson, Cockcroft&#8211;Walton, and Greinacher, the proposed structures do not require extension by adding extra stages and chains to obtain demanded high voltage. Additionally, the presented topologies solve the conventional voltage multipliers&#8217; drawbacks, including output voltage drop and significant voltage stress across the CP cells&#8217; capacitors. Input current ripple and flux density of the coupled transformer in IMDCPI is compared with its counterparts to demonstrate its improved features. Detailled experimental results are provided which verify the proposed inverters&#8217; performance.</description></item><item><title>State-Plane Centric Control of Bidirectional Dual Active Bridge Converters in V2X Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11091491</link><description>Dual active bridge (DAB) converters are a common choice for bidirectional battery chargers due to their efficient dc&#8211;dc isolation capabilities and the possibility to control power flow direction. The control of this topology using traditional linear controllers based on small-signal models typically leads to a slower dynamic response, especially during large transients.

Recent advances in the field of piezoelectric transformers have developed a variety of structure types, while the piezoelectric transformer with a spherical shape has not been researched. Here, we present a spherical piezoelectric ceramic transformer capable of achieving both step-up and step-down output characteristics in radial vibration. The resulting design is made of two layers of piezoceramic spherical shells and three layers of metal spherical shells. The basic mechanism is that the input electrical energy is converted into mechanical energy via the inverse piezoelectric effect, and then the converted mechanical energy is reconverted into electrical energy, thus realizing step-up and step-down voltage conversions. The electromechanical characteristics, voltage gain, and power gain for our proposed spherical piezoceramic transformer as functions of electric load resistance and geometry size under different dielectric and mechanical losses are analyzed. The experiments are conducted to verify the performance parameters of our proposed design, which are basically consistent with the results of numerical simulation and theoretical analysis. The power gain of our proposed spherical piezoceramic transformer can reach about 36% when the input voltage of the function generator is 20 V peak-to-peak and the load resistance is 125 &#937;.

Traditional electrothermal methods, which rely on iterative calculations coupling electrical and thermal models, face challenges due to the disparity in timescales, where power devices manifest dynamic operation on fast timescales, while thermal effects evolve over much longer timescales. To tackle this challenge, the article introduces a novel multitimescale electrothermal coupling model, which balances computational demand and accuracy in calculating the junction temperature of power devices under various operating conditions such as switching frequency, load profiles, and ambient temperature. The proposed model integrates a circuit model encompassing a power loss model and a state model for the power device, with a thermal model constructed using the finite element method.

These types of power plants need to be enhanced in terms of their resilience as well as increasing their share. This article proposes an improved combined control method aimed at enhancing resilience. The method focuses on solving grid-connected converter challenges under unbalanced disturbed grid voltage conditions. These conditions are more commonly observed in converter-based microgrids due to structural and operational issues, such as weak grids, un-transposed lines, single-phase loads, etc. The current references in the proposed method are calculated to minimize their dependency on measured grid voltage and system parameters as much as possible. Also, the proposed integrated method is designed to handle severe load changes and symmetrical voltage sags. Moreover, a resilient control system should be capable of interacting with the system and learning new information from events in accordance with the resilience definitions. Thus, the proposed method incorporates reinforcement learning as an added value to enhance the level of resilience in a more comprehensive and effective manner. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces current THD by about 35%, decreases switching losses by 50%, and eliminates overshoots under dynamic conditions compared to conventional methods.

However, for the tie line between the OWF and the MMC, the unique fault behaviors will threaten the correct operation of conventional distance relays. Therefore, a coordination scheme between protection and control is proposed in this article. The proposed method can make the distance relay on the OWF terminal be triggered within 0.3 s. After that, the zone I distance relay on the MMC terminal can safeguard the entire line, allowing the fault to be switched off in less than 0.7 s. The proposed method can make the OWF-MMC system compatible with the traditional distance relays, while the overvoltage can be suppressed. Furthermore, the typical fault ride-through (FRT) demands such as current limitation and reactive current injection are still satisfied. In addition, the suggested approach possesses a robust capacity to tolerate fault resistance. These advantages avoid investment in modifying the protection algorithm while effectively protecting the inverter.

However, its considerable circulating current increases the loss of switches and limits the improvement of its efficiency. In this article, a circulating current suppression method (CCSM) is proposed. By changing the inner phase shift angle of the integrated MP2U, the extra operating state of the MP2U can be used, and the working state sequence of the MP2U is reconstructed to change the current waveform in the MP2U. The proposed CCSM control can completely eliminate the circulating current when the two input ports are matched and greatly suppress the circulating current when the two input ports are mismatched, achieving the overall efficiency optimization of the dual-input converter. In addition, the optimized inner phase shift trajectory of the proposed CCSM control under different mismatch conditions is calculated, and the soft switching operation of all switches in MP2U is ensured.

First, the mechanism and characteristics of this SSR are analyzed based on the impedance method. As the decrease of grid stiffness, the PMSG will oscillate due to the impedance interaction between the inductive grid impedance and the capacitive PMSG impedance in the low-frequency range. To suppress this SSR, a single-loop active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) of the PMSG grid-side converter (GSC) is proposed, which consists of two different single-loop controllers of the d- and q-axis. Meanwhile, a differential feedforward control is applied to reduce the tracking error of linear extended state observer. Under the proposed control, the impedance of PMSG no longer has capacitive characteristics, which will not cause impedance resonance with the weak grid. Compared with the voltage and current dual loop ADRC, the proposed single-loop ADRC directly adjust dc-side voltage of GSC with considering ac-side current, which can improve the dynamic and steady-state performance of the PMSG. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed SSR suppression method is verified by the simulation and experimental study.</description></item><item><title>Split Complementary Duty Modulation for Balanced Switching Loss in Bidirectional Resonant Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10950101</link><description>In conventional fixed-frequency bidirectional resonant converter, the upper switches at the primary side or the lower switches at the secondary side suffer from high heat due to the hard switching turn-off under buck or boost modes respectively in both power-flow directions. To balance the switching loss among the primary-side or secondary-side switches, we propose split complementary duty modulation for a fixed-frequency bidirectional resonant converter. The split complementary duty modulation enables the upper switches at the primary side or the lower switches at the secondary side to operate with the main duty and the complementary duty split by fixed duty ratio of 0.5 during two consecutive switching periods under buck or boost modes in both power-flow directions. Asymmetric current flows through the switches, so extra dead-time is required for the primary-side or secondary-side switches with weak zero-voltage switching current under buck or boost mode in both power-flow directions. The different minimum dead-times required for all the switches are analyzed in detail. Under the split complementary modulation, the resulting switching losses on the switches are well balanced. A 1.6-kW prototype with primary-side voltage range of 320&#8211;480 V and secondary-side voltage of 400 V is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed switching modulation.</description></item><item><title>Optimization of Damping Controller for Mitigating DC Dynamics and Internal Harmonics Causing Subsynchronous Oscillation in MMC-HVDC Connected Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10960746</link><description>This article explores a novel subsynchronous oscillation (SSO) in the modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based high-voltage direct current (HVDC) connected wind farms.

The LLC-DAB hybrid bidirectional converter is a single-stage converter, which is composed of LLC resonant circuit and dual active bridge (DAB) circuit. It combines the advantages of LLC and DAB, making it highly suitable for use as a submodule (SM). However, differences in input impedance among these SMs can lead to power imbalance during operation, affecting the performance of the system. To address this problem, a novel power sharing control strategy based on multiagent consensus theory is proposed in this article. This method treats each SM as an agent. By exchanging information with its neighbors, each SM can regulate its power in real- time to achieve power sharing. Additionally, an adaptive dynamic compensator is proposed to compensate for control processes in real-time, thereby reducing settling time of the system. Compared to traditional power sharing strategies, the proposed method not only ensures power sharing among SMs but also improves the dynamic performance of the system.

Many hybrid active switched-inductor (ASL) switched-capacitor (SC) dc-dc converters have been proposed due to their outstanding gain characteristics among nonisolated converters. However, resonance between the inductor and the parasitic capacitor of the switch can occur in this type of converter, which leads to significant voltage oscillation across the two switches. As a result, the actual voltage stress across the switches will be much higher than the theoretical value. In this article, a novel self-clamping hybrid ASL-SC converter is proposed. The proposed converter can utilize its inherent self-clamping structure to eliminate the voltage oscillation across the switches, which results in lower voltage stress across the switches. Additionally, the proposed converter also exhibits several intrinsic advantages: high voltage gain, lower voltage stress across the output diodes, higher efficiency, and a constant potential difference between the grounds of its input and output ports. This article describes the comprehensive performance characteristics analysis. Moreover, a detailed comparative performance is carried out with other similar converters. Finally, a 20&#8211;60 V/400 V, 50 kHz, 200 W experimental prototype has been established in the laboratory to evaluate the proposed converter.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Layer Fuzzy Mapping-Based Dynamic Power Allocation Strategy for Electric-Hydrogen Hybrid Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10950082</link><description>Integrating a hydrogen energy storage system into the traditional lead-acid battery-supercapacitor energy storage architecture can significantly enhance the energy density and facilitate long-term electricity storage.

The innovative dual stator-winding structure eliminates the drawback of needing power frequency conversion at the energy receiving side of previous single-phase wireless motors. Consequently, the motor can be wirelessly driven from the energy transmitting side, requiring no active power electronic components on the receiving side. Additionally, the use of envelope modulation technology to control the inverter enables the motor to be driven efficiently using sinusoidal-wave voltage. Thus, the entire system provides a safer and more convenient fully-isolated actuator solution for conventional single-phase induction motor applications operating in harsh environments. Initially, the novel integrated wireless motor was introduced and analyzed, focusing specifically on the feasibility and operational mechanisms of the single-phase induction motor utilizing a dual stator-windings structure. Subsequently, the power and current outputted to the motor by the entire wireless motor system were analyzed, especially the frequency characteristics of its driving voltage, and a design methodology for the system was formulated based on the analyzed results. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed wireless motor, simulation models and an experimental prototype were developed. Both the simulated results and experimental results demonstrate that the sinusoidal wave-driven wireless integrated single-phase induction motor system can operate effectively at 1410 rpm with 91.2% efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Millimeter-Scale, High-Power Density Linear Piezoelectric Resonant Actuator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10959321</link><description>Micro/nano systems integrated with piezo-actuation technology have garnered significant attention in recent years. Here, we report a millimeter-scale linear piezoelectric resonant actuator (LPRA) operating in two orthogonal, coupled first-order bending vibrations modes. The proposed LPRA is made of a piezoceramic-metal composited bar with a center hole defect, which causes a sudden stiffness reduction in dense composite bar, leading to a prominent increase in the center vibration amplitude, thereby significantly enhancing the electromechanical coupling and interface actuation effect. A two-phase equivalent circuit is further derived to explain the enhancement behavior of the artificial defect. Under one pair of orthogonal voltages of 100 Vpp at 190.8 kHz, the elaborated micro-LPRA with a weight of only 0.149 g can frictionally drive a slider moving linearly via its center resonant vibrations, generating a maximum pulling load of 0.34 N, a maximum velocity of 308 mm/s, and a minimum step displacement of only 30 nm in open-loop control. Correspondingly, its power density is as high as 0.67 W/cm3, which is about 3 to 20 times higher than those reported previously. The proposed LPRA and its stiffness tuning strategy will bring great beneficial for future micro, smart devices/systems development.</description></item><item><title>Input Excitation Disturbance Separation-Based Energy-Saving Attitude Control for Flexible Spacecraft With Actuator Degradation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10950134</link><description>Actuator degradation (i.e., partial loss of effectiveness) of flexible spacecraft is multiplicatively coupled with the control input and mixed with the flexible vibration disturbance. How to accurately identify and compensate these disturbances is a key to improve the attitude control performances. This article studies the high-precision and energy-saving attitude control of flexible spacecraft in the presence of composite disturbances including actuator degradation, actuator bias, and flexible vibration disturbance. A refined deep-coupled attitude dynamic model is established to clearly reveal the inherent coupling relations among angular velocity, control input, and composite disturbances. In the first phase, a novel input excitation disturbance observer (IEDO) is proposed to separate the composite disturbances, and then a parameter identification method is designed to identify the parameters of actuator degradation and bias. Due to the accurate separation ability of IEDO, the parameter identification performance will not be affected by the flexible vibration disturbance. In the second phase, a sliding mode observer is designed to estimate the flexible vibration disturbance and parameter identification error, and then an energy-saving composite attitude control law is proposed by accurately compensating the composite disturbances. Finally, numerical results and experiment results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description></item><item><title>A Smith-Like Active Disturbance Rejection Control Design for a Class of Overdamped Processes With Application to Low-Pressure Heater System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948447</link><description>This article proposes a Smith-like active disturbance rejection control (SLADRC) for a class of overdamped processes composed of multiple first-order inertial components, where the idea of the SLADRC comes from Smith predictor.

However, the computational burden for practical implementation increases exponentially for the traditional exhaustive enumeration approach. Conventional methods include reformulating it as an integer least-square (ILS) problem and employing supervised imitation learning techniques based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) to mitigate the computation burden issue from longer prediction horizons. In this article, a novel autonomous controller is developed by fusing the reinforcement learning (RL) framework with a long prediction horizon for converter control. In this way, the RL agent learns autonomously the optimal switching strategy by interacting with the converter system. In addition, to ensure a tractable training process and convergence, a hierarchical action space partitioning approach is proposed based on the receding horizon principle. Finally, an online demonstration framework is presented to realize the practical implementation of the algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed long prediction horizon RL controller is validated via both simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Antiswing Control of Underactuated Rotary Cranes: An Improved Iterative Learning Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10957836</link><description>Rotary cranes are critical in industries such as manufacturing, military, and construction, where high safety and control performance standards are required due to complex operating environments. While existing automatic control methods have advanced in tracking and swing suppression, they often overlook valuable insights from historical data and the practical limitations of motor output torque, which complicate implementation and hinder performance. This article proposes an improved iterative learning control scheme that utilizes nonstrict repetition historical data to enhance tracking accuracy and suppress swing, even under input saturation and uncertainties. Specifically, the proposed approach incorporates refined trajectory adjustment and time scale transformation, improving the selfregulation of the control strategy in nonstrict repetition iterations. Furthermore, a smoothing function is introduced to address the nonlinear effects of input saturation, simplifying controller design. The finite-time convergence of the closed-loop system is rigorously proven using a composite energy function. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively reduces payload swings and ensures precise tracking, validating its effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Self-Adaptive Energy-Autonomous Integrated System for Full-Wave Acceleration Measurement with Single Multifunction Transducer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948498</link><description>Self-power sensors provide an effective solution of long-term monitoring for many applications. An obstacle in the path is the common mismatching of the harvested power and the required power since the harvester and the sensor are independently designed without cooperative consideration. This article proposes an energy-autonomous integrated system (EAIS) designed to wirelessly acquire and transmit vibration signals without the need for an external power source. The system employs a piezoelectric cantilever that both harvests energy and senses acceleration, integrating two circuit subsystems: the energy harvesting subsystem and the acceleration sensing subsystem.

Small-signal stability is a representative issue. Though, existing frameworks either ignore the uncertainties of renewables, or only focus on the worst case. In this regard, this paper establishes a small-signal stability constrained stochastic-robust optimal power flow (OPF) model, which aims to optimize the expected cost of scheduling results with respect to the probability distributions of uncertainties while ensuring the small-signal stability requirement even in extreme scenarios. However, the synergy of uncertainties and the complicated small-signal stability mechanism significantly increase the solving difficulty. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework to overcome this challenge. First, we solve the stochastic OPF without small-signal stability constraints. For those results that do not meet the stability requirements, we use them as initial points to locate the effective boundary of the OPF feasible region where the robust small-signal stability requirement is satisfied. The effective boundary location is realized in an iterative manner. Then, in the neighborhood of this effective boundary, we construct a linear surrogate expression to represent the original robust small-signal stability constraint with Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and sample weighted support vector machine (swSVM). Finally, we solve the OPF model with the surrogate constraint. Moreover, we further propose a constraint correction strategy to guarantee the stability requirement. Case studies verify that the proposed method can acquire economical operation schemes and meet the robust small-signal stability requirement at the same time.</description></item><item><title>A Self-Supervised Pre-Learning Method for Low Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839636</link><description>As wind power is becoming a major energy source of power systems, the risk of power shortages due to its intermittent low power output is growing. Accurate forecasting of low wind power is crucial for mitigating these impacts. However, conventional methods struggle with few-sample issues due to the infrequent occurrence of low wind power, limiting accuracy improvements. To address this, a self-supervised pre-learning method is proposed to forecast low wind power occurrence period and output, leveraging the similarities and differences among low output samples to enhance forecasting accuracy. Low wind power output is decomposed into low wind power events (LWPE), which represent the occurrence timeframe, and low wind power processes (LWPP), which represent the power sequences. For LWPE forecasting, a siamese residual shrinkage network based on contrastive learning is introduced. This network pre-learns LWPE features from sample pairs to mitigate the impact of imbalanced sample distribution. For LWPP forecasting, a pattern recognition-based embedded forecasting framework is proposed, embedding typical LWPP fluctuations into the prediction network to improve fit under limited sample conditions. A case study on 3 wind farm clusters shows that this method improves LWPP forecasting accuracy from 84.99%-86.6% to 89.97%, outperforming traditional methods without pre-learning.</description></item><item><title>Estimation of Stability Region for Grid-Forming Inverters Considering Switching Characteristics via Constructing Damping-Reflected Energy Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843855</link><description>Grid-forming (GFM) inverters have been widely used as the interface between renewable energy sources and power grid. During low voltage ride through (LVRT) period, to limit the fault current, GFM inverters will experience the switching of control strategy, which makes the transient stability of GFM inverters exhibit different features from that of synchronous generators (SGs). In this paper, considering the switching characteristics induced by virtual impedance (VI), the framework of predicting the transient stability of GFM inverters during the fault period and after fault clearance is established from the perspective of energy. To reduce the conservativeness of the stability region, a uniform energy function considering the damping dissipation and the dynamics of reactive power control loop is constructed for the transient stability analysis of GFM inverters. Compared with existing approaches, the stability region estimated by the proposed energy function can intuitively show the effect of damping, and effectively reduce the degree of conservatism in transient stability prediction. Finally, simulation and hardware-in-loop experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method in the transient stability prediction of GFM inverters with switching characteristics.</description></item><item><title>A Decentralized Demanded Power Tracking and Voltage Control Method for Wind Farms Based on Data-Driven Sensitivities</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10848501</link><description>Efficient power dispatch in wind farms (WFs) hinges on precise demanded power tracking. This study proposes a decentralized WF power tracking and voltage control method based on data-driven sensitivities (DDSs). This method relies only on local operational variables for model predictive control (MPC), achieving near-global optimal solutions. With a backpropagation algorithm, a new sensitivity calculation method is designed to yield DDSs by computing the gradients of a global mapping model (GMM). The voltage DDSs can be derived simply by calculating the gradient of the voltage GMM and can replace the voltage sensitivities in traditional MPC methods. The power DDSs establishes linear relationships between the power outputs of different wind turbines (WTs), simplifying the WF state-space equations to local prediction models for reducing the quadratic programming dimensions. The three control modes designed based on DDSs enable control without WF line parameters, reduce computational complexity, or combine both effects. The variable spacing constraint linearization method transforms nonlinear constraints into linear ones, addressing the nonlinear coupling between control variables. Testing on a WF with 32 WTs in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method comparable to centralized control methods.</description></item><item><title>Approximately Adaptive Distributionally Robust Optimization for Energy and Reserve Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10849978</link><description>This paper proposes two novel paradigms of approximately adaptive distributionally robust optimization (AADRO) for the energy and reserve dispatch with wind uncertainty. The piecewise linear policy-based AADRO (PLP-AADRO) approximates the adaptive optimization-based recourse decision as piecewise affine adjustment, while the piecewise value function-based AADRO (PVF-AADRO) approximates the quadratic recourse problem as piecewise linear recourse problems. Moreover, an equal probability principle is developed to achieve a high-quality segmentation of the wind power ambiguity set. Consequently, the distributionally robust quadratic cost constraint can be decomposed into decoupled piecewise constraints, allowing the dispatch problem to be formulated as a less-iterative or even non-iterative program. The two-stage AADROs with polyhedron supported uncertainties are first recast precisely as tractable forms with semidefinite constraints, by employing duality theory and S-lemma. Then, the distributionally robust cost constraint in PVF-AADRO is handled by dual vertex generation, and the bilinear terms in both AADROs are addressed by alternating optimization. Numerical simulations verify the efficiency of AADROs in approximating the strict adaptive distributionally robust optimization, and their adaptability in different cases is discussed.</description></item><item><title>Inertia Transmission Control of Full-Power Converter Variable-Speed Pumped Storage System for Grid Frequency Support</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10852016</link><description>Full-power converter variable-speed pumped storage (FPC-VSPS) is a promising technique for flexible power regulation in small-scale distributed hydroelectric power plants. However, conventional vector control limits the synchronous motor of the FPC-VSPS from providing inertia support to the power grid. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces an inertia transmission control for FPC-VSPS based on the concept of DC voltage synchronization. Firstly, the control incorporates the DC capacitor power equation into the GSC control. To enable inertia transmission from the FPC-VSPS synchronous machine, the DC capacitor dynamics are fed into both the speed and torque control of the MSC. Secondly, a torsion spring-rigid body equivalent model is introduced based on the inertia transmission process, analyzing the effects of physical parameters, control coefficients, and transmission delays on the inertia transmission performance. Theoretical analysis and simulation results reveal that the inherent physical differences and transmission delay have a negative impact on the effectiveness of the inertia transmission. Consequently, a DC capacitor design method based on inertia matching is proposed, accounting for the constraints of physical inertia matching, system stability, and operational security. Finally, simulations and experiments prove the necessity of inertia matching and verify the effectiveness of the proposed control to cope with frequency fluctuations in both pumping and generating modes.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Grid-Forming Undersea Pumped Storage to Enable 100% Renewable Offshore Oilfield Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854915</link><description>To advance carbon reduction of the offshore oilfield power system (OOPS), the grid-forming undersea pumped storage system (GFM-UPSS) emerges as a promising solution. This paper introduces a novel framework for a 100% renewable OOPS utilizing the GFM-UPSS. Firstly, the control strategy of the GFM-UPSS is presented. It consists of the grid-side converter (GSC), machine-side converter (MSC), and reversible pump-turbine (RPT) to achieve frequency and voltage regulation. A steady-state model is then developed detailing the water head, power, and volume of the spherical shell. In addition, the paper explores the converter parameter impacts on the GFM-UPSS transient model and derives the closed-form solutions. With the steady-state model, an optimal sizing method is presented and economic advantages in the marine environment are studied for the GFM-UPSS. Finally, EMT simulations are conducted to assess the frequency &amp; voltage stabilities and verify the effectiveness of the GFM-UPSS in enabling a 100% renewable OOPS. The optimal sizing results show that construction costs, mainly for OWP, are dominated and are influenced by sphere radius, placement depth, and start-stop cycles, while a 2.5 capacity ratio between OWP and GFM-UPSS consistently emerges as optimal. Moreover, analysis of transient stability shows that it improves with higher frequency &amp; voltage modulation coefficient and lower virtual impedance. The impact of RPT and MSC, mainly on frequency regulation, is determined by the DC droop coefficient and turbine inertia.</description></item><item><title>A Coordinated Adaptive SMC Method for Frequency Regulation Control in Power Systems With Multiple Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10855531</link><description>The extensive integration of renewable energy resources inevitably gives rise to the complex and uncertain power system, where the somber matter of frequency instability becomes apparent. This article presents a coordinated adaptive radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)-based sliding mode control (CAR-SMC) to reduce the frequency deviation and oscillation of the uncertain power system comprising multiple wind farms. Firstly, the SMC is aimed at establishing the upper layer control law of the frequency regulation controllers. Then, the uncertainties are represented with RBFNN, and an adaptive law is employed to estimate the uncertainties online rapidly and realize the free-chattering of SMC. Furthermore, since a single SMC is only capable of handling a single control input system, a power distribution law based on momentum is proposed to implement the multiple control inputs of the AR-SMC, and also coordinate the frequency regulation abilities of wind turbines and energy storage systems (ESSs). Eventually, the proposed CAR-SMC is validated on a modified IEEE 39-bus system. The simulation results demonstrate that CAR-SMC can enhance the frequency stability in the presence of disturbances and uncertainties during steady-state operation, as well as in under-frequency and over-frequency scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Spatio-Temporal Wind Speed Prediction Based on OWT-STGradRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869841</link><description>Taking into account the orientation and distance characteristics of wind turbine stations in wind farms can improve the accuracy of wind power prediction.

However, current methods are affected by the intermittent, non-stationary and stochastic nature of solar energy and thus cannot satisfy the requirement of high-precision forecasting. To this end, we propose a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) forecasting method based on bubble entropy and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) regularization, called BesFCM. This method first utilizes bubble entropy to fuse two mode decomposition methods to improve the representation of PV data to capture effective features with significant stability and discriminative ability, then employs a FCM with a combination of fuzzy logic, neural networks, and expert systems to model solar PV power generation, and finally develops a high order FCM learning method based on SCAD regularization to alleviate the overfitting problem, enhancing the robustness and generalization ability of forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate that the BesFCM achieves the best overall performance on PV power datasets from multiple sampling intervals in multiple regions of Belgium compared to multiple state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness for solar power generation forecasting, providing support and reference for improving the quality of smart grid dispatch and reducing spare capacity reserves.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Suppression for Temporary Overvoltage Considering Dynamic Interactions Between LCC-HVDC and Renewable Energy Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874178</link><description>Temporary overvoltage (TOV) severely restricts the development and utilization of renewable power resources (RPRs), especially when RPRs are delivered through the line commutated converter-based high voltage direct current (LCC-HVDC) system. To reveal the TOV mechanism for the sending system during commutation failures (CFs), the transient process of the system is partitioned into different stages, where the evolution of the system trajectories is analyzed. On this basis, the variation of AC voltage and DC current considering complex dynamic interactions between LCC-HVDC and renewable energy Plants (REPs) during repetitive CFs (RCFs) is clearly quantified. After revealing the impact of control parameters of both REPs and the LCC-HVDC on the TOV during RCFs, a collaborative optimization method for control parameters is proposed for TOV suppression. Moreover, when the blocking after the RCF tends to be inevitable, the optimal blocking moment is determined to inhibit the TOV caused by HVDC blocking. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods are verified with EMT simulations of a typical benchmark system.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Modeling and Switching Control of Electric Vehicle Aggregation for Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10878811</link><description>The aggregation and control of massive electric vehicles (EVs) are crucial for grid frequency regulation (FR). However, challenges such as disordered charging, high computational and communication burdens need to be addressed. To this end, a hierarchical hybrid modeling and switching control method for EV aggregation (EVA) is proposed. For modeling, a hybrid state set for EVs comprising three discrete states and one dynamic state is established at the local level. The dynamic state's flexibility allows EVs to charge orderly while considering user demands. At the aggregation level, a Markov-based EVA state space model is designed, integrating the user's willingness-to-pay (WTP) index and hybrid state. It estimates the EVA's FR capacity (FRC) with a lower communication burden and reduces computational burden by simplifying control dimensions. For control, a model predictive control (MPC)-based state switching method is designed at the aggregation level, considering user's FR willingness and power cancellation issue. Furthermore, a predictive compensation mechanism is designed to address model parameter errors resulting from asynchronous control cycles.

The strategy includes three layers: the system layer, the ESS operation layer, and the coordination control layer. In the system layer, a detailed frequency response model of the multi-area interconnected system is developed. The intrinsic mech-anisms of timing, depth, and the effect of ESS and conventional generating unit (CGU) in SFR are revealed through the sen-sitivity analysis of the power allocation factor. Furthermore, a sensitivity-based adaptive power allocation strategy for ESS and CGU is proposed, which improves the SFR effect while reducing the ESS power and maintaining the state of charge (SOC). In the ESS operation layer, the ESS is divided into two components for integration, employing a monotonic charge-discharge strategy to reduce lifetime degradation caused by frequent charging and discharging, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. In the coordination control layer, considering the power prediction and the ESS operating state, a SOC optimization strategy based on the double-input fuzzy control (DIFC) is proposed. It further dynamically corrects the power allocation factor based on fuzzy rules, optimizing the SOC level to ensure the bidirectional SFR capability of ESS under all conditions. The case studies validate the overall SFR performance of the proposed strategy with different scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Spatiotemporal Graph Contrastive Learning for Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879260</link><description>Accurate and robust wind power forecasting plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and stability of the power system. Hybrid spatiotemporal forecasting models based on graph convolutional networks have received widespread attention due to their advantages in spatial feature extraction. However, these methods are susceptible to the quality of the generated graph due to data noise and missing issues, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning model based on spatiotemporal graph contrastive learning to address the above issues. Specifically, the model's encoder combines an adaptive graph convolutional network with LSTM to capture fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies. To enhance the robustness of the encoder against data noise, we apply feature-level and topology-level data augmentation techniques to the model's input and design two contrastive learning auxiliary tasks from the temporal and spatial dimensions, respectively. Furthermore, to capture more comprehensive spatial correlations, we construct an adaptive graph by fusing the static graph with a learnable parameter matrix. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>A Carryover Storage Valuation Framework for Medium-Term Cascaded Hydropower Planning: A Portland General Electric System Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884034</link><description>Medium-term planning of cascaded hydropower (CHP) determines appropriate carryover storage levels in reservoirs to optimize the usage of available water resources. This optimization seeks to maximize the hydropower generated in the current period (i.e., immediate benefit) plus the potential hydropower generation in the future period (i.e., future value). Thus, in the medium-term planning, properly quantifying the future value deposited in carryover storage is essential to achieve a balanced trade-off between immediate benefit and future value. To this end, this paper presents a framework to quantify the future value of carryover storage, which consists of three major steps: i) constructing a deterministic model to calculate the maximum possible hydropower generation that a given level of carryover storage can deliver in the future period; ii) extracting the implicit locational marginal water value (LMWV) of carryover storage for each reservoir by applying a partition-then-extract algorithm to the constructed model; and iii) developing a set of analytical rules based on the extracted LMWV to effectively calculate the future value. These rules can be seamlessly integrated into medium-term CHP planning models as tractable mixed-integer linear constraints to quantify the future value properly, and can be easily visualized to offer valuable insights for CHP operators. Finally, numerical results on Portland General Electric's CHP demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented framework in aiding medium-term CHP planning to identify suitable carryover storage strategies.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Hydrogen Production Dispatch of Networked Hydrogen-Based Microgrids via a Distributed Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884064</link><description>Hydrogen has drawn significant attention due to its long-term storage capability and wide industrial applications. How to efficiently utilize renewable energy to maximize hydrogen production of a group of spatially distributed electrolyzers is a fundamental problem urgently needed to be solved. This paper is the first to attempt to address the problem by proposing a hydrogen production dispatch (HPD) model for hydrogen-based microgrids with proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. Considering the limited communication and privacy requirement of distributed energy systems, a distributed hydrogen production dispatch framework is constructed. The original nonconvex optimization problem is transformed into a convex form. Furthermore, it is proven that the marginal hydrogen production benefit of each electrolyzer should be equal for the optimal hydrogen production dispatch via Lagrangian duality. By setting the marginal hydrogen production benefit as a consensus variable, a novel distributed consensus-based dispatch algorithm is developed, in which an event-triggered communication scheme is introduced to alleviate the communication burden. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm achieves linear convergence. Results of the case study indicate that the proposed strategy yields the optimal hydrogen production benefit, which is increased by 9.43% compared to on-site hydrogen production and demonstrates excellent solving efficiency especially for large-scale systems.</description></item><item><title>Transient Frequency-Voltage Support Strategy for VSC-MTDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farms Based on Perturbation Observer and Funnel Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884062</link><description>To address the transient frequency and voltage stability challenges posed by low-inertia offshore wind farms (OWFs) connected through voltage source converter (VSC) based multi-terminal high voltage direct current (VSC-MTDC) system, a nonlinear perturbation observer and funnel control-based transient frequency and voltage support (PFTFVS) control strategy is proposed for VSC-MTDC integrated OWFs system.

Finally, dynamic simulations of VSC-MTDC integrated OWFs system are built to verify the validity and robustness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Integration of Electrical Energy Storage in Wave Energy Hardware-in-the-Loop Test Rigs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887246</link><description>This paper presents a design methodology for integrating an electrical energy storage unit into a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test rig for wave energy converters (WECs). Typically, the power production from WECs is characterised by pronounced fluctuations at low frequency and high peaks compared to the average. Wave energy test rigs should be able to reproduce these variations to impose realistic conditions to the device under test. Thus, the grid connection of the rig must be sized to cope with high peaks, and additional measures may be required to avoid disturbances on nearby loads and negative effects on voltage quality. The integration of electrical energy storage can smoothen power fluctuations and mitigate these drawbacks, while resulting in lower installation and operating costs. The design methodology indicates how to effectively size the storage unit and which technology to favour based on the type and duration of test campaigns. Numerical simulation results are presented for a dual HIL test rig and operational profiles of three different WEC technologies. For designs with energy storage lifetime shorter than the calendar life, sensitivity analyses indicate that the rig's annual utilisation rate and the level of accelerated testing have a significant effect on the storage energy requirements.</description></item><item><title>Station-Network Cooperative Optimization Planning of Urban Integrated Energy System Considering Heat Storage Capacity of Heat Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891182</link><description>Heat storage capacity of heat network in urban integrated energy system (UIES) has the potential to significantly improve the operational flexibility of the system. To obtain the optimal UIES planning scheme, a UIES station-network cooperative optimization planning (UIES-SNCOP) method considering heat storage capacity is proposed. First, a heat network operation model under constant flow-variable temperature considering flow direction depiction is established for solving the problem that the existing model cannot be directly applied to UIES-SNCOP because the flow direction of pipeline cannot be predetermined. Then, a radial structure-oriented topology model of distribution and heat networks is developed to ensure the radiality of energy supply network while also reducing planning cost. On this basis, a UIES-SNCOP model based on information gap decision theory and stochastic optimization is constructed to realize the co-optimization of the siting and sizing of energy station and topology of distribution and heat networks. Finally, a solution method of UIES-SNCOP model based on relaxation-contraction coupled McCormick envelope is proposed for effectively improving the accuracy of solution result. The planning of UIES is conducted on an urban topology containing 55 nodes to test the performance of the proposed method, and simulation results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other existing methods in terms of reducing planning cost, ensuring radial structure of the energy supply network, utilizing heat storage capacity and enhancing solution accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Adaptive Robust Model for AC Network-Constrained Unit Commitment in Power Systems With Uncertain Wind Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891662</link><description>With wind power being extensively integrated into power systems, its inherent uncertainty and variability pose significant challenges to the power system operational security. Traditional robust optimization methods capture the worst-case scenario, which results in overly conservative decisions, with insufficient considerations on AC network constraints in power systems. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel adaptive robust AC network-constrained unit commitment (AC-NCUC) model that considers both the AC network security and the uncertainty of wind power output in power systems. More specifically, a convex polyhedral uncertainty set is constructed to characterize the uncertain wind power output. Here, the conservativeness of UC dispatch decisions can be adjusted by modifying the size of the convex polyhedral uncertainty set. Then, we combine Benders&#8217; decomposition and Newton-Raphson methods to solve the AC-NCUC model for the optimal dispatch decisions. Simulation results on the modified IEEE 6-bus and IEEE RTS 79 systems validate the rationality and validity of our proposed approach. The proposed AC-NCUC model effectively maintains the system security while ensuring economic effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Power Control in Wind Farms for Gearbox Load Reduction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891746</link><description>Rapid power and torque fluctuations in time-varying conditions increase the fatigue load and failure rate of wind turbine (WT) gearboxes. In this study, an optimal power control method is proposed for a wind farm (WF) to improve the power flow and service quality, allowing the WF to track the power demand instructions from the transmission system operator while minimizing the fluctuations of vibration displacements inside the gearbox. A comprehensive dynamic model of the gearbox is developed by analyzing the transmission mechanism of key gearbox components, such as the planet carrier, planet gears, sun gears, and spur gears, describing the correlation between the internal vibration and mechanical torque and power output. Then, an optimal power control problem is formulated based on model predictive control to suppress the fatigue load while tracking power. Furthermore, a fatigue evaluation system is built based on the real-time vibration state inside the gearbox to characterize the service quality of WTs and guide the power generation of the WF. This approach provides a safety-oriented boundary regarding the WT fatigue load in the optimal power dispatch issue of WFs to suppress potential WT failures. Case studies in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Deterministic Forecasts and Prediction Intervals for Wind Speed Using Enhanced Multi-Quantile Loss Based Dilated Causal Convolutions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891745</link><description>With rising wind power penetration into power systems obtaining wind speed forecasts with associated uncertainty becomes crucial for better planning and dispatch. This study proposes an enhanced multi quantile regression-based loss function specially tailored to train models to generate both deterministic forecast and the corresponding prediction intervals. Though the regression architecture of the model plays an important role in extracting precise forecasts, however, its efficiency is often ignored which may be a downside for short term forecasting scenarios where model training time may also be a significant factor. The present study therefore designed a multi-scale dilated convolution-based architecture for enhanced efficiency. The architecture generates predictions at different scales which are combined using particle swarm optimization to obtain optimal forecasts. The model is trained using the proposed loss function on datasets from both NREL simulations and operational Chinese state grid measurements across three different locations. The proposed model exhibits excellent forecasting performance in comparative experiments with both simulated and real-world operational datasets.</description></item><item><title>Stability Region Estimation and Decentralized Transient Control for Parallel Grid-Tied Grid-Forming Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892023</link><description>Renewable energyes are highly penetrated in power system through Grid-forming inverter (GFMI). Transient stability of single GFMI system under severe grid fault has been thoroughly analyzed in recent years, but quantitative analysis for parallel grid-tied GFMI system is rarely studied. To fill this gap, the large signal equivalent model of parallel system considering the interaction between inverters is newly built. Based on the model, the Lyapunov function incorporating kinetic energy, potential energy, damping dissipation, and interaction energy is constructed for accurate stability region estimation. Then, the effect of control parameters on stability region is analyzed, indicating that increasing damping, reducing inertia, and lowering reference power of one GFMI can deteriorate stability margin of parallel GFMI system due to the enlarged interaction power, which is distinct from single GFMI system. For this, a decentralized transient control that adaptively adjusts damping, inertia, and reference power is proposed to guarantee transient stability and achieve low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) for parallel system without relying on communication, system information. Finally, simulation and experimental tests validate the correctness of theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of proposed control.</description></item><item><title>Aggregation Feasible Region of Full Power Spectrum Electric Vehicles Based on Polyhedron Projection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10900425</link><description>The aggregation of electric vehicles (EVs) can take full advantage of the power flexibility of EV clusters, based on the aggregation feasible region (AFR) of EVs. However, existing aggregation techniques of conventional distributed energy resources (DERs), exhibit significant inaccuracies or require excessive computational efforts when applied to EVs with high power and small capacity. To solve this problem, an iterative method based on the high dimensional polyhedron projection principle is proposed to derive the exact AFR formula for the full power spectrum of EVs, and the limitations of the existing analytical AFR are revealed. The results reveal that the exact AFR is a set of linear inequalities, whose coefficients can be represented in binary code, and the complexity of the right side is linear with the number of EVs, making it highly conducive to programming calculations. Moreover, this paper proposes a simplified practical AFR based on the exact AFR, which reduces computational complexity. Numerical simulation cases demonstrate that the accuracy of this simplified approach is still higher than that of existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Matrix Adaptive Correction-Based Dynamic Dimensionality Reduction Method for Voltage-Related TSCOPF in Bulk Power Systems With High Wind Power Penetration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902439</link><description>Transient security-constrained optimal power flow (TSCOPF) is an important class of problems for system operation. Several challenges arise when dealing with bulk power grids, including the large size and complex transient voltage behaviors. This paper aims to address such hurdles by proposing a dynamic dimensionality reduction matrix adaptive correction (DDR-MAC) algorithm, which can effectively evaluate proper Volt/Var levels to guarantee secure system operation. First, this paper performs dimensionality reduction processing at the bus and device levels to obtain a low-dimensional model with dominant modes, which solves the problems of high-order and large computational volumes of differential equations. Moreover, a dimensionality reduction error assessment model is established to ensure reduced-order accuracy. Then, the reduced-order TSCOPF model is equivalently decomposed into a mixed-integer linear optimization model and a combined coefficient correction model for system dynamic constraints and steady-state nonlinear constraints. Furthermore, a secant/tangent sensitivity adaptive correction method is presented to achieve fast computation. The DDR-MAC approach is verified across differently scaled IEEE test systems and the Nordic test system and can improve computational efficiency by 49.07% while offering higher accuracy than traditional computation methods.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Synthetic Inertia Control for Two-Area Power Systems With Wind Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10906542</link><description>Modern power systems may experience decrease in stability due to the increased integration of variable generation sources that depend on power electronics converters. A common control strategy is to incorporate synthetic inertia from wind turbines, typically using state-feedback control in a single-area power system model that assumes uniform frequency. As power systems become more interconnected, different frequency behaviors can emerge in multiple areas, casting doubt on current methods that do not consider multi-area stability. Furthermore, most single-area synthetic inertia methods ignore the limitations of communication systems in real power systems. This paper proposes a decentralized synthetic inertia control strategy for a two-area power system with wind power. This approach accounts for the actual behavior of power systems in different areas and the limitations of communication systems in real scenarios. Numerical results, derived from dynamic models using actual operating data from the Chilean Power System, demonstrate that the decentralized control performs comparably to centralized control in maintaining power system stability and optimizing frequency nadir. However, the decentralized control has the advantage of relying solely on local variables, eliminating the need for communication links between areas during operation.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Strategy for Frequency Regulating and MPPT for Photovoltaic Sources Based on a Novel Three-Parameter Characteristic Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10907967</link><description>The large-scale integration of Photovoltaic (PV) sources may reduce system inertia and power quality, resulting in increased frequency fluctuations and diminished system stability due to lack of the primary frequency regulation (FR) capability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified strategy for frequency regulating and Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) for PV sources to provide ancillary services to the power grid. The strategy employs a specifically designed active power control (APC) method to enable rapid and flexible power adjustments of PV sources, with which further FR function may be achieved. The presented APC algorithm adopts an iterative technique with a novel three-parameter PV characteristic curve, making it possible to reconstruct the real-time PV generation model, clarify the relationship between the system frequency, output power, and operating voltage. Its high control accuracy, fast convergence rate, and strong explainability offer significant practical value. Additionally, this adaptive control strategy features autonomous switch between the FR and MPPT modes adapting to real-time irradiation changes, without the need for additional irradiation or temperature sensors. The integration enhances both solar utilization efficiency and the FR capability, while eliminating the controller transitions during operating mode switches. Hardware-in-the-loop tests validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Online Monitoring of Battery Degradation for Enhanced Power Smoothing of PV Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908680</link><description>In pursuit of a carbon-neutral future, the integration of photovoltaic (PV) power plants into the electrical power grid is expanding. Although beneficial, this expansion presents challenges due to weather-induced variability, which destabilizes the grid and causes voltage and frequency deviations. A viable solution is the use of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) alongside PV power plants. However, conventional controllers, which lead to uniform and frequent charging cycles, accelerate degradation and reduce efficiency in BESS. To address this, this paper proposes segmenting the BESS units into distinct charging and discharging groups, effectively minimizing battery cycling and enhancing their lifespan. The controller dynamically assigns batteries to each group based on power fluctuation forecasts using a power-sharing model. This model manages battery activation, enables inter-group support, and balances degradation by monitoring BESS charge levels and assessing battery health through an online system. This controller, coupled with a degradation balancing layer, strategically prioritizes units based on their cycling age. The proposed technique was rigorously tested and experimentally validated, demonstrating that it significantly reduces battery degradation to a maximum of 0.099%, in stark contrast to the up to 4.41% observed with conventional controllers.</description></item><item><title>State Transfer Induced Transient Synchronization Instability of GFM-VSC: Analysis and Improvement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909647</link><description>The operation mode of grid-forming voltage source converters (GFM-VSCs) may switch between voltage source mode (VSM) and current source mode (CSM) under some situations such as grid faults, owing to the current limitation control. During the mode-switching process, there is state transfer from the final state of the last mode to the initial state of the next mode, which impacts the transient synchronization stability (TSS) of GFM-VSCs. This paper primarily focuses on analyzing and improving the TSS of GFM-VSCs by considering the effect of state transfer. A novel transient instability mechanism is revealed through the existence analysis of equilibrium points. It clarifies that the state transfer may cause the operating trajectory during faults to bypass the stable equilibrium point in CSM before diverging to the next cycle, thereby resulting in transient synchronization instability. Besides, to further analyze the TSS of mode-switched VSCs considering the dynamics during faults, multiple Lyapunov functions are adopted to derive the TSS criteria and boundaries. It has been identified that lowering the minimum critical current and adjusting the saturated current phase in accordance with virtual power angle (VPA) dynamics can enhance the TSS. Therefore, a VPA feedback-based current limiting strategy is proposed to safeguard GFM-VSCs against overcurrent and ensure the TSS. The validity of the new transient instability mechanism and the efficacy of the proposed strategy are confirmed through simulations of a GFM-VSC connected to an IEEE 39-bus power grid and hardware-in-the-loop experiments.</description></item><item><title>Assessing Dynamic Reserves vs. Stochastic Optimization for Effective Integration of Operating Probabilistic Forecasts</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909649</link><description>Probabilistic forecasting is becoming pivotal in utilities' decision-making processes, offering an accurate portrayal of plausible forecast deviations as opposed to deterministic forecasting which only focuses on the expected forecasted variables. Two methods, dynamic reserve and stochastic optimization, have been used to integrate probabilistic forecasts into power system operational planning. Dynamic reserve predicts system reserve requirements based on observed (from historical observations) or expected (from probabilistic forecasts) uncertainty spreads. This approach has a low computational burden, but it is commitment and dispatch agnostic. Stochastic optimization, on the other hand, considers multiple scenarios simultaneously (from probabilistic forecasts), allocating recourse across the commitment and dispatch variables, but demanding high computational resources and time. The selection between these methods depends on utility requirements and specific situations. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of both methods using a calibrated real-size system representing the Southern Company for medium and high solar penetration levels. Additionally, it proposes a hybrid dynamic reserve and stochastic optimization approach with a risk evaluation pre-scheduling procedure to enhance decision-making.</description></item><item><title>Minimax Regret Robust Co-Planning of Transmission and Energy Storage Systems With Mixed Integer Recourse</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909558</link><description>The growing penetration of renewable energy sources, with intermittent and uncertain nature, brings new challenges to the secure and efficient operation of power systems. Expanding transmission networks and utilizing energy storage (ES) have been introduced as effective solutions to address these challenges. This paper presents a minimax regret robust co-planning model with mixed integer recourse for transmission and ES systems, designed from the perspective of a central planner. The model considers a polyhedral uncertainty set for future peak load growth, while uncertainties in wind farm expansion are addressed through internal scenario analysis. This approach will guarantee the robustness of investment decisions and provide the central planner with a clear picture of the maximum regret among all possible scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed minimax regret framework facilitates strategic planning for ES installation after the resolution of long-term uncertainties. In this paper, we reformulate the model into a standard min-max-min problem, in which the maximization level is only over uncertainties. Subsequently, a five-level solution strategy based on a modified nested column and constraint generation decomposition technique is represented to deal with the intractability and complexity of the problem caused by binary variables of transmission lines and ES blocks. The model is finally evaluated through comprehensive simulation studies to verify its tractability, practicality, and effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic Model-Based Minute-Level Optimal Operation Strategy for Alkaline Electrolyzers in Wind-Hydrogen Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912757</link><description>Maintaining the export power of wind-hydrogen systems within a stable range is critical for power system security. However, this is challenged by the mismatch between large time-scale of alkaline electrolyzer (AWE) scheduling strategies and the short-term fluctuations of wind power. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel minute-level optimization strategy for AWE operation. Developing effective small time-scale strategies requires a detailed consideration of AWE dynamics. To this end, we first introduce its steady-state electrochemical characteristics and third-order dynamic models for both temperature and Hydrogen-to-Oxygen (HTO) ratio. Based on these refined models, we develop an AWE optimization framework that enables electrolysis power to track minute-level wind power fluctuations by dynamically adjusting fine-grained variables, such as the lye flow rate, cooling flow rate, and pressure, at 1-minute intervals. To overcome the computational challenges posed by the detailed modeling, we propose an improved model predictive control (MPC) framework. This framework incorporates model simplifications to improve computational efficiency, along with an optimization-simulation iterative procedure to ensure operational feasibility. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed strategy extends the AWE load range by 13.8% and reduces wind power curtailment by 15.06%. Additionally, synergies among control variables enable the system to achieve a balance between operational efficiency, stability, and security, highlighting the potential of this approach to enhance the performance of wind-hydrogen integrated systems.</description></item><item><title>Promote Data Sharing in Integrated Power-Traffic Networks: A Coalition Game Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10910214</link><description>Accurately estimating spatial-temporal electric vehicles' (EVs) charging demands is crucial for the secure and economic operation of power systems. At present, the distribution system operator (DSO) relies on historical data collected at each charging station to estimate future EV charging demand. However, the station-level forecast disregards EVs' spatial correlations within traffic networks (TNs) and might suffer significant forecast error, forcing the DSO to make conservative scheduling at the expense of operation economics. To this end, this paper proposes to leverage cross-sector information (i.e., traffic demand data and network parameters in TNs) to enhance forecast accuracy and avoid over-conservative operations. To facilitate the data sharing among the DSO and TN data holders (i.e., traffic authority and navigation App. companies), we adopt the Coalition Game theory to uncover how these entities could cooperate to benefit each other, and to fairly allocate the extra profits (i.e., the operational cost reduction induced by the improved forecasts) among themselves. The conditional value-at-risk theory is adopted to model the risk-averse behavior of the DSO. In case studies, we reveal the non-negligible impact of TN condition variations on EV charging distributions. Moreover, numerical results show that sharing high-quality traffic data contributes to the reduction in DSO's operating cost by utmost 20.8% as compared to the current practice without data sharing.</description></item><item><title>An Optimization Framework for Component Sizing and Energy Management in Electric-Hydrogen Hybrid Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10915713</link><description>This paper proposes an optimization framework to address the component sizing and energy management problems in an electric-hydrogen hybrid energy storage system connected to a wind turbine. The total cost of the hybrid system is minimized using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In particular, four decision variables are optimized: the electrolyzer (EL) size, the supercapacitor (SC) size, and two parameters in the energy management strategy (EMS). To determine the power split factor for the wind power, the EMS introduces an artificial potential field (APF) and defines a virtual force based on the SC state of charge (SOC). Two APF parameters are optimized to tune the power allocation between the EL and the SC: the shaping parameter of the virtual force and the basis parameter of the power split factor. Since the cutoff frequency of the low pass filter (LPF) in the EMS is adaptively updated based on the optimized APF parameters, the proposed framework is referred to as the &#8220;OP-APF&#8221; framework. The effectiveness of the OP-APF framework is validated by performing MATLAB and real-time simulations. Compared to three baseline frameworks, OP-APF is more effective in reducing the system total cost, controlling the SC SOC, and alleviating the EL degradation.</description></item><item><title>Photovoltaic Power Prediction Considering Multifactorial Dynamic Effects: A Dynamic Locally Featured Embedding-Based Broad Learning System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916943</link><description>Accurate photovoltaic power (PVP) prediction is a prerequisite for the efficient and stable operation of new power systems. While existing research has extensively explored the relationship between global factors such as temperature, irradiance, and photovoltaic power, the local dynamic impacts of these factors are often overlooked, which may reduce the accuracy of predictions. To address this issue, this paper considers the dynamic interrelationships among multiple factors and proposes a dynamic locally featured embedding-based broad learning system (DLFE-BLS) algorithm for PVP prediction. Firstly, a novel dynamic phase space reconstruction method (DPSR) is proposed to characterize the dynamic properties of multivariate data. Furthermore, a dynamic local featured embedding (DLFE) algorithm is introduced to extract local dynamic features from multivariate data. Finally, by integrating the dynamic reconstruction and dynamic feature extraction processes into the broad learning system (BLS) framework, we propose the DLFE-BLS algorithm to improve the accuracy of PVP prediction. Case studies have shown that DLFE-BLS outperforms other models in terms of prediction accuracy. Additionally, it has the highest accuracy when applied to transfer prediction.</description></item><item><title>Optimal VSG BESS Sizing for Improving Grid-Following Converter Stability Under Various Dispatch Scenarios and Grid Strengths</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924310</link><description>As renewable energy integration increases, ensuring stability of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) in weak grids is crucial, as grid-following (GFL) converters often become unstable under such conditions. Integrating virtual synchronous generator (VSG) batteries has shown potential to improve GFL stability, but determining the optimal size of the VSG required for stability remains an open question. Existing research typically relies on small-signal or impedance models for stability analysis, which are only valid at a single operating point and do not consider the full range of operating conditions, including various dispatch scenarios and grid strengths. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel methodology to visualize the system's stable operating region, offering insights into stability boundaries across various real power and grid impedance variations. Additionally, it introduces an optimal VSG battery sizing strategy that accounts for these variations, ensuring stability while minimizing VSG capacity. The strategy's effectiveness is validated through comprehensive PSCAD simulations, demonstrating its reliability across a wide range of real power and grid impedance operating points.</description></item><item><title>Fast Centralized Model Predictive Control for Wave Energy Converter Arrays Based on Rollout</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10923686</link><description>Centralized control of wave energy converter (WEC) arrays for grid-scale generation can achieve higher energy production than decentralized (independent) control, due to its capability of fully exploiting mutual radiation effects. However, the state-of-the-art centralized model predictive control (CMPC) is significantly more computationally challenging than decentralized MPC (DMPC), since the number of control moves to be optimized grows in proportion to the number of WECs. In this paper, a fast CMPC controller is proposed, whose idea is to optimize only the first few control moves while rolling out future system trajectories using a fixed controller. A linear, two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) controller with a sea-state-dependent control coefficient tuning strategy is further proposed to serve as the rollout controller. It is shown that the proposed rollout-based CMPC (R-CMPC) can maintain almost the same energy production as conventional CMPC under a wide range of sea states, while significantly reducing the optimization dimension (in the studied case, by a factor of 6), enabling ultra-fast online computation (about 40 times faster than conventional CMPC).</description></item><item><title>Energy Management of Multi-Energy Communities: A Hierarchical MIQP-Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10923740</link><description>This paper proposes a hybrid mixed-integer quadratic programming-constrained deep reinforcement learning (MIQP-CDRL) framework for energy management of multi-energy communities. The framework employs a hierarchical two-layer structure: the MIQP layer handles day-ahead scheduling, minimizing operational costs while ensuring system constraint satisfaction, while the CDRL agent makes real-time adjustments. The goal of this framework is to combine the strengths of CDRL in addressing sequential decision-making problems in stochastic systems with the advantages of a mathematical programming model to guide the agent's exploration during the training and reduce the dependency on opaque policies during real-time operation. The system dynamics are modeled as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), which is solved by a model-free CDRL agent built upon the constrained policy optimization (CPO) algorithm. Practical test results demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in improving the optimality and feasibility of the real-time solutions compared to existing stand-alone DRL approaches.</description></item><item><title>Complex Variable Design for Power Control of Grid-Forming Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854804</link><description>The analysis and design of the grid-forming (GFM) power loop and decoupling control can be challenging due to the coupled high-order system, where active and reactive power controls are typically designed separately using a dual-input-dual-output model.

Using the measured input/output data of the MG, a data-driven dynamic linearization model related to disturbances is built at each operating point of the closed-loop control system. Next, we develop a robust recursive regression method to learn the dynamic linearization parameter that is updated online. To estimate the lumped disturbance, an adaptive disturbance observer with an observer gain updated online is introduced. Subsequently, the adaptive data-driven cooperative controller with an iterative structure is developed. This method can effectively regulate the voltage and frequency of the islanded MG with adaptability to system changes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through both simulations and field tests in a real 100% PV powered islanded microgrid.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Data-Driven Frequency Control With Minimal Cost for Renewables Dominated Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045213</link><description>This paper proposes an adaptive data-driven frequency control with minimal cost for renewables-dominated microgrids, which does not rely on its accurate model. The Koopman operator provides the theoretical basis for the global linearization of nonlinear systems, and the extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is the most computationally efficient method for its approximation. However, insufficient disturbance in normal cases cannot excite all system modes, causing EDMD to overfit the estimated model and deteriorate the performance of the data-driven method. To address this issue, this paper develops adaptive extended dynamic mode decomposition (AEDMD). AEDMD reduces data requirements by extracting dominant dynamic modes through the persistent excitation condition and principal component analysis. It solves the issue of insufficient input excitation by designing the control matrix with the assistance of the control-affine structure of grid-forming converters. This paper utilizes model predictive control (MPC) to achieve rapid frequency recovery and minimize generation cost by coordinating different types of distributed resources. In addition, the stability of the control system is theoretically clarified. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on several systems.</description></item><item><title>State-Space Variation Induced Instability During Mode Switching in Multi-Source DC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051022</link><description>DC bus signaling strategy is a common solution for achieving multi-mode autonomous operation in multi-source DC microgrids. This strategy often results in two different types of mode switching, which are classified based on whether state-space variation occurs before and after the switch. This paper investigates the voltage instability caused by state-space variation during mode switching of multi-source DC microgrid. Firstly, this paper analyzes how the dynamic behavior of the mode switching influences system stability and provides a state-space switching stability analysis method. The switching process may cause the system state to deviate from the region of attraction (ROA), thereby triggering system instability. Additionally, the mechanism of state-space variation induced instability during mode switching is revealed: mode switching involves mutual coupling among the adjustment processes of different source control strategies. This coupling exacerbates power imbalance, ultimately leading to system instability. To improve stability, an extended mode scheduling control method has been proposed by introducing transition modes to address the power imbalances during the mode switching. Finally, the experimental results verify the analytical mechanism and control method.</description></item><item><title>Applications and Services of Solid-State Transformers in Active Distribution Networks&#8212;A Critical Review</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016957</link><description>Distribution systems have traditionally received the least attention in the bulk picture of power systems; they are yet the most &#8220;critical component&#8221; as they directly impact customers&#8217; perception and utilities&#8217; reputation. While transmission systems have seen abundant literature, innovations, and applications of power electronic-based devices to optimize their performance, distribution systems still require more attention toward a flexible and dynamic scheme to cope with volatile energy consumption and production.

Traditional Distribution Network Reconfiguration (DNR) is formulated as an optimization problem that determines optimal switch states for network conditions. With the increasing variability introduced by distributed energy resources (DERs), real-time DNR research has evolved toward continuously identifying optimal switch states over time. However, in practical operations, the simultaneous change of multiple switches can compromise system stability, making it essential to optimize the sequential order of individual switch operations. This study introduces a new DNR formulation that integrates sequential switching optimization into real-time applications, enabling fast and stable operation under dynamic conditions. To achieve this, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for sequential optimization and develop an agent learning environment that incorporates constraints on conditional loop networks and individual switching conditions, newly introduced in the DSDNR problem. The proposed algorithm is validated through case studies, including unbalanced systems, demonstrating that optimized sequential switching prevents partial outages, voltage instability, and line overloading. Furthermore, the results confirm that the method ensures stable system operation even in high-DER variability environments.</description></item><item><title>Iterative and Accelerated Techniques for Distributed Robust Service Restoration Strategy in Flexible Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045214</link><description>The integration of power electronic devices and distributed energy resources (DERs) into distribution networks is crucial for enhancing service restoration performance through flexible power regulation. However, the complex operational requirements pose challenges in coordinating them during power outages. To leverage the potential application value of multiple resources, this paper proposes a distributed robust restoration strategy that incorporates iterative and accelerated techniques. A soft open point integrated with energy storage is introduced and optimized alongside the local DERs. The distributionally robust optimization (DRO) method is used during the implementation of the recovery strategy, facilitating the participation of intermittent renewable sources. These measures collectively enhance system resilience. Subsequently, a distributed robust service restoration framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is employed for multiregional networks, allowing the robust model to be solved in a distributed manner. To ensure the computability of the model with numerous integer variables, relaxation iterations and induced acceleration processes have been developed within the algorithms to effectively nest DRO and ADMM, thereby significantly improving the model&#8217;s convergence and efficiency. Two test systems, the IEEE 33-bus system and a large-scale IEEE 123-bus system, were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model and approach.</description></item><item><title>Meteorological-Electrical Integrated Real-Time Resilience Assessment for Power Systems Based on Deep Learning Methods</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11063459</link><description>Recent widespread power outages caused by extreme weather events have elevated expectations for power system resilience, thereby emphasizing the critical need for proactive resilience assessment. However, given the uncertain pathways and intensities of such events, along with the extensive range of potential failure scenarios, achieving real-time resilience assessment remains challenging. This paper proposes a meteorological-electrical integrated real-time resilience assessment method for power systems to efficiently quantify the resilience level and precisely identify vulnerable areas against imminent typhoon disasters. Firstly, a novel synergistic downscaling approach for typhoon nowcasting models is proposed. This method combines deep transposed convolutional neural networks and statistical downscaling approaches to provide wind speed forecasts with higher spatial resolution. Spatiotemporal mismatches between typhoon nowcasting models and power systems are then addressed through geographical alignment and multi-timescale coordination. Based on the aligned wind speeds and component fragility models, an edge-adapting, physics-informed ChebNet-based deep learning method is developed to attain efficient and accurate resilience assessment of power systems. This method calculates system resilience metrics and component vulnerability indexes throughout the event, enabling vulnerable area identification. Numerical simulations are conducted on the IEEE 39-bus system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through comparisons.</description></item><item><title>N-1 Evaluation of Integrated Electricity and Gas System Considering Cyber-Physical Interdependence</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029084</link><description>The deepening digitalisation of infrastructure has significantly increased the interconnection between power systems (PS) and gas systems (GS), rendering integrated electricity and gas systems (IEGS) more vulnerable to cyber-physical contingencies (CPC). This paper pioneers the investigation into N-1 contingency evaluation for cyber-physical IEGS to identify critical failures that pose threats to operational security. To accurately model various CPCs in IEGS, we introduce a nonlinear partial differential-algebraic equation (PDAE) model, which redefines CPCs as discontinuities and abrupt changes in simulation boundaries. We further propose a variable-coefficient analytical method (VC-AM) designed to robustly and efficiently handle these reformulated boundaries during CPC simulations. Building on this foundation, an N-1 evaluation framework is established to explore the contingency impact propagation and detect resultant violations, incorporating several performance indexes to quantify and rank the impacts of diverse contingencies. Case studies reveal that cyber-physical interdependence notably amplifies the effects of contingencies, underscoring the potential of VC-AM for real-time N-1 evaluation. In contrast, traditional methods are hindered by high computational complexity and convergence challenges.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Market-Aided Restoration Approach of Multi-Energy Distribution Systems Considering Comprehensive Uncertainties From Typhoon Disaster</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029621</link><description>The increasing deployment of multi-energy distribution systems (MDSs) necessitates the coordinated restoration of power and thermal loads under disasters. Nevertheless, existing research often overlooks the inherent uncertainties of disasters and the potential of market mechanisms, resulting in risks of over-investment and inefficient allocation of flexible resources. Thus, this paper presents a distributed market-aided restoration approach for MDS considering the comprehensive uncertainties from typhoon disasters. First, a stress intensity interference theory combined with a structural fragility model is utilized to characterize the uncertainty of distribution line damage caused by typhoons. Second, a tractable operational model for MDS, incorporating numerous auxiliary variables, is introduced to simplify the constraints of power and thermal networks. Then, a risk-averse two-stage restoration framework is developed to manage comprehensive uncertainties from both line damage and renewable generation. Meanwhile, a Cournot Nash-based joint bidding model of multi-energy microgrids is designed as a market-aided strategy to facilitate the restoration of MDS. Further, a distributed algorithm named alternating search procedure is utilized to protect participants&#8217; privacy and alleviate the computation burdens. Finally, case studies based on real statistics of the 2024 super typhoon &#8220;Yagi&#8221; in China validate that the proposed method creates a win-win situation for all stakeholders.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Heat and Electricity Dispatch Based on an Encrypted Equivalent Modeling Method of Heating Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11032138</link><description>The dispatch problem of integrated energy systems faces a contradiction between the unified modeling and privacy protection issues as various energy systems belong to different sectors. An encrypted equivalent modeling method is proposed to construct the feasible region of district heating system (DHS) considering its thermal inertia and elasticity. A sensitivity modeling method is adopted to equivalently construct the feasible region of DHS and hide its absolute state information. The relative state information and structural parameters of DHS is further reduced and encrypted through the redundancy-constraint-elimination technology and an equivalent constraint-transformation technique. Then, based on the DHS equivalent model, a non-iterative dispatch model was constructed for thermal and power systems. The dispatch model can fully utilize the elasticity of DHS and guarantee to obtain the global optimization. Case studies verifies the equivalence of the proposed encrypted feasible region model of DHS and the improvement in solving efficiency for the optimal dispatch problem. The solution time is reduced by two orders of magnitude compared to the heat-power iterative solution method. The redundancy-constraint-elimination technology further reduces the solution time by more than half. Economy and flexibility improvement brought by the elasticity of DHS to power systems are also verified.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Capacity Planning for Integrated Charging Microgrids Along Highways Considering Seasonal Fluctuation and Risk Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11037299</link><description>Upgrading highway service stations to integrated electric-hydrogen charging microgrids (IEHCMs) has become a significant aspect of coordinated decarbonization in the energy and transportation sectors. However, the increasing integration of variable renewable energy and charging loads intensifies uncertainties within the IEHCMs, potentially leading to energy imbalances on multiple timescales, thereby introducing a need for flexible and reliable options. This paper proposes a novel two-stage capacity planning method for interconnected IEHCMs that considers energy sharing. The method incorporates year-round operation based on a reconstructed full-scenario time series and a conditional value-at-risk model with extreme scenario tail risk characteristics. Photovoltaic generation, interconnected DC lines, and short-term and seasonal hydrogen storage resources are optimally allocated to provide a solution for the IEHCMs that balances reliability and economics, managing fluctuations on multiple timescales while keeping risk below acceptable levels. Numerical results show that the proposed model helps integrate renewables for future highway service stations and provides more reliable planning results.</description></item><item><title>SocioDiff: A Socio-Aware Diffusion Model for Residential Electricity Consumption Data Generation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021430</link><description>Disadvantaged communities face disproportionate energy burdens, yet they remain underrepresented in electricity consumption datasets. This lack of data may limit the development of targeted assistance programs and energy policymaking, thereby perpetuating systemic disparities and increasing the risk of energy poverty. To address this pressing issue, we propose SocioDiff, a novel diffusion-based model for generating synthetic residential electricity consumption data that incorporates socio-demographic information. SocioDiff introduces the Socio-aware SSSD process, which integrates social attributes into the data generation workflow. SocioDiff employs a two-step diffusion process to separately capture global trends and household-specific details to ensure representative and diverse synthetic consumption data. Additionally, adversarial training is used to improve the representation of disadvantaged communities. Experimental results using the Irish Energy Regulatory Commission dataset show that SocioDiff achieves a 63.59% improvement in Maximum Mean Discrepancy compared to traditional methods and leads to a 4.4% improvement in downstream load forecasting performance. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating socio-demographic features for generating more equitable and inclusive consumption data and supporting the development of fairer energy models and policies for disadvantaged communities. The generated dataset and documentation are publicly available at https://github.com/Intelligame/SocialDiff.</description></item><item><title>Load Frequency Control for Integrated Electrical-Water System Considering Water Hammer Effect</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11022760</link><description>Demand response (DR) is a valuable tool in load frequency control (LFC) of power systems, especially in improving the system&#8217;s regulating capacity. The pumps, with their rapid response capabilities, can be effectively utilized as a DR resource to further enhance LFC performance. However, improper adjustment of pumps will cause the accumulation of pressure pulsations throughout the water distribution system (WDS), resulting in the water hammer effect. To address this issue, this paper introduces a water hammer feedback loop in LFC with DR to balance the power system stability as well as WDS operational safety. With the wave tracking method (WTM), the proposed LFC method enables efficient modeling of the hydrodynamic process with low computational complexity and acceptable accuracy. A model predictive control (MPC) based optimal control algorithm is also developed to adjust the pumps and generation units. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits significant improvement on the performance of pressure pulsation regulation. Results also show the enhanced stability and effective pressure fluctuation mitigation in the electric-water coordinated control.</description></item><item><title>BRM-Based Joint Resource Management for Demand-Side Communication in Smart Grid Considering Resource Coupling Effects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11022749</link><description>Demand response plays a pivotal role in maintaining supply-demand balance in smart grids, relying on reliable two-way communication between the control center (CC) and consumers. However, the uncertainty introduced by data surges poses challenges to communication reliability, leading to load tracking pressure and additional costs for system stability. This paper proposes a computing-network convergence communication architecture that integrates the advantages of edge computing and cooperative relaying technologies. By deploying edge computing devices (ECDs) on the user side for edge data processing, the proposed framework mitigates the adverse effects of data surges and enhances demand-side communication performance. Furthermore, considering the limitations of resources, we develop a bandwidth release model (BRM) based on Amdahl&#8217;s Law and hardware performance limitations to analyze the coupling effects between communication and computation resources. On this basis, a QoS-constrained resource sharing mechanism is established. The dynamic interaction between the utility company (UC) and the telecom operator (TO) is characterized by using a Stackelberg game, allowing for balanced allocation of communication and computation resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly improves system communication quality and economic efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Hardware-in-the-Loop Experimental Testbed Using Air Conditioners for Grid Balancing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11023557</link><description>Driven by the need to offset the variability of renewable generation on the grid, development of load control is a highly active field of research. However, practical use of residential loads for grid balancing remains rare, in part due to the cost of communicating with large numbers of small loads and also the limited experimentation done so far to demonstrate reliable operation. To establish a basis for the safe and reliable use of fleets of compressor loads as distributed energy resources, we constructed an experimental testbed in a laboratory, so that load coordination schemes could be tested at extreme conditions. This experimental testbed was used to tune a simulation testbed to which it was then linked, thereby augmenting the effective size of the fleet. Modeling of the system was done both to demonstrate the experimental testbed&#8217;s behavior and also to understand how to tune the behavior of each load. Implementing this testbed has enabled rapid turnaround of experiments on various load control algorithms, and year-round testing without the constraints and limitations arising in seasonal field tests with real houses. Experimental results show the practical feasibility of an ensemble of small loads contributing to grid balancing.</description></item><item><title>Unsupervised Power Load Super-Resolution Based on Contrastive and Internal Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11032179</link><description>Power load super-resolution technology aims to recover power load time series data with a high resolution from low-resolution power load data, providing a more accurate representation of actual power load. Existing deep learning-based load super-resolution methods require paired low- and high-resolution load data to train a model, and the model is used to perform load super-resolution tasks on the unseen low-resolution load data. Nevertheless, these approaches have limited applicability in real-world scenarios where high-resolution data is difficult to obtain, which makes training the model infeasible. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a new system to overcome this limitation. Supported by self-learning techniques, the system can generate load data with a desired high resolution without using high-resolution load data to train the load super-resolution model (i.e., the model can only be trained by the low-resolution load data). The system is also equipped with an unsupervised noise identification module, enabling the system to effectively identify diverse noise signals in the load sampling process and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments and comparison studies are conducted on a real-world dataset to validate the effectiveness of the proposed technology, and the results demonstrate the technology can achieve a comparable performance to supervised load super-resolution methods and has high adaptivity to load super-resolution tasks with different scaling factors.</description></item><item><title>Communication Accessibility Oriented Deployment Strategy of Hybrid IoT Terminals for Dispatching Large-Scale Flexible Loads in Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11032171</link><description>The global power system transition highlights the potential contribution of flexible loads as regulation resources for addressing fluctuations from emerging renewable energies. To dispatch flexible loads accurately and instantly, the power systems impose higher requirements of communication accessibility on local access services in communication systems, i.e., massive terminal access, frequent interaction, and cost-efficient accessibility. Thus, to enhance communication accessibility, this paper proposes a bi-level optimization framework to deploy hybrid Internet of Things (IoT) terminals for dispatching large-scale flexible loads by load aggregators to provide regulation resources in power systems. The framework includes: 1) a deployment strategy of hybrid IoT terminals considering various communication performances; 2) a bi-level optimization model integrating the interaction between the power system regulation scheme and the communication system deployment strategy; 3) an iterative algorithm addressing communication demands of load aggregators and the communication performance of different IoT terminals. Moreover, the numerical results demonstrate the proposed strategy can provide effective communication accessibility and further improve local access services.</description></item><item><title>Renewable Energy Following Strategy via Quantified Aggregated Heterogeneous Electric Vehicle Flexibility</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11037515</link><description>The rapid expansion of renewable energy (RE) generation brings environmental and economic benefits. However, the mismatch of the RE generation pattern and load profile introduces the imbalance between energy supply and demand, posing challenges to modern smart grids. While RE generation is inherently less controllable, the emergence of controllable loads, particularly electric vehicles (EVs) with their flexible charging and discharging capabilities, offers a promising solution to dynamically adjust energy consumption to match RE availability. To this end, this paper proposes a RE following mechanism for EV aggregator (EVA), enabling coordinated charging and discharging of EVs. First, we mathematically quantify the aggregated flexibility of EVs using an affine transformation of convex polytopes. This approach improves computational efficiency and accuracy in aggregating individual heterogeneous EV flexibility with different parameters. Then, a RE following mechanism for the EVA is formulated, treating the quantified EV flexibility set as an operating envelope. Two RE following evaluation methods, namely, Euclidean norm and cosine similarity, are used to assess the RE following effectiveness. Finally, we propose a pricing strategy accommodating various charging and parking decisions of EVs based on a combined framework of time-of-use (TOU) pricing and intraday-block pricing (IBP), incentivizing EV participation in RE following. The numerical results show that the proposed RE following mechanism significantly improves RE utilization, leading to an average increase of 62.04% in the RE consumption ratio and a 13.35% boost in average profits compared to the other two cases without RE following strategies.</description></item><item><title>ExDiffusion: Classifier-Guidance Diffusion Model for Extreme Load Scenario Generation With Extreme Value Theory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11062498</link><description>Extreme load scenario generation is essential for power system planning and security assessment. However, the challenges of limited data and complex external features in extreme events make it difficult for existing methods to generate realistic and diverse extreme load scenarios. To address the challenges of data scarcity and feature complexity, this paper proposes a novel scenario generation method, ExDiffusion, to generate diverse and high-quality load scenarios for both extreme and normal conditions, under limited data. This method enables effective modeling of the medium and tail behavior in time series load data by integrating the classifier-guidance diffusion model with the autoregressive model, leveraging Extreme Value Theory (EVT). Firstly, the method introduces an extremeness measure to synthesize load-level labels and augment the data via the diffusion model. A classifier-guidance diffusion model is then developed to reduce the dimensionality of the input features and guide the diffusion model to generate tailored scenarios, thereby reducing feature complexity and increasing the diversity of generated scenarios. Furthermore, extreme scenarios are modeled using the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD), refining the loss function of the diffusion model to facilitate the generation of realistic extreme load scenarios. The experiments on real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method has superior performance compared with existing methods in terms of accuracy, diversity, and effective generation of normal and extreme load scenarios, which demonstrates the potential of ExDiffusion as an efficient approach for extreme scenario generation.</description></item><item><title>Secondary Frequency Regulation via EV Aggregation-Based Virtual Power Plants: A Mean Field Game Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029625</link><description>This paper proposes a scalable mean field game (MFG) strategy for virtual power plants (VPPs) to coordinate large-scale electric vehicles (EVs) in providing secondary frequency regulation services. Firstly, in order to estimate the frequency regulation capability of the geographically dispersed EVs aggregated by the VPP, a joint data- and model-driven rolling evaluation approach based on a temporal multi-graph fusion neural network (TM-GCN) is designed, providing an essential basis for the subsequent optimal bidding and regulation signal decomposition. It is a challenging task to incentivize large-scale heterogenous and self-interested EVs to proactively response to the time-critical frequency regulation command. Therefore, a scalable MFG is formulated for the VPP to rapidly decompose the secondary frequency regulation signals and revenues among numerous EVs, effectively breaking through the curse of dimensionality. The existence and uniqueness of the mean field game equilibrium (MFGE) are validated utilizing the Brouwer fixed-point theorem and the contraction mapping theorem. Moreover, a distributed solution algorithm is developed to search for the MFGE, which exhibits good convergence performance across varying numbers of aggregated EVs. Comparative studies have validated the superiority of the proposed methodology in distributing secondary frequency regulation tasks across large EV fleets while maximizing VPP&#8217;s economic benefits.</description></item><item><title>Non-Iterative Coordinated Optimal Dispatch of Distribution System and Microgrids via Fast Approximation Equivalent Projection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11036544</link><description>Developing a coordinated optimal dispatch (COD) strategy for distribution systems (DS) and accessed microgrids (MGs) is one of the solutions to enhance the flexible operation of power systems. Under the premise of the operational autonomy of MGs, existing COD studies can be classified into iterative methods that allow for independent decision-making in DS and MGs, and non-iterative methods based on the operational region (OR) modeling of MGs. However, the iterative methods hardly guarantee computational convergence and efficiency, while non-iterative methods struggle to solve equivalent projections with high-dimensional ORs. To this end, a fast approximation progressive vertex enumerations (FAPVE) algorithm-based non-iterative COD approach is proposed, where the high-dimensional OR considering time coupling characteristics can be formed effectively. First, a reliable outer normal vectors calculation method along with a vertices and normal vectors count limiting mechanism are introduced to enhance the computational efficiency and stability of the FAPVE algorithm. Second, a time-decoupling method for day-ahead MGs&#8217; OR based on initial MG decisions is presented to ensure the applicability of the proposed algorithm to day-ahead COD problem. Statistical analysis verifies the computational efficiency and accuracy of the FAPVE algorithm, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed time-decoupling method based on non-iterative framework.</description></item><item><title>Frequency Reserve Service From Heat Pumps and Electrolyzers in Power Systems: A Sealed-Bid Auction Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11036542</link><description>With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs), power system inertia is steadily declining, leading to more pronounced frequency variations during disturbances. Therefore, in future low-inertia grids, frequency reserve service (FRS) from the controllable load sector will become increasingly critical. While much research has focused on FRS from RESs and Active Controllable Loads (ACLs), such as Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) and Electric Vehicles (EVs), the potential of Passive Controllable Loads (PCLs) has been largely overlooked. Additionally, there is a lack of an appropriate framework in the literature to determine the optimal price and quantity of FRS from each supplier. Hence, this paper addresses these gaps by investigating FRS from heat pumps (HPs) and electrolyzers, two key PCLs expected to play crucial roles in future power grids. Furthermore, a sealed-bid auction (SBA) framework is proposed to determine the optimal price as well as quantity of FRS from various suppliers, using nadir point deviation (NPD) and the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) criteria of the frequency response. According to the results, when the system inertia decreases from 5 seconds to 2 seconds, the required FRS reserve increases from 0.07 p.u. to 0.24 p.u., and the FRS price approximately doubles. Finally, the analyzed case studies show the effectiveness of the HPs and electrolyzers as well as the developed market model to improve the frequency response of the system.</description></item><item><title>Strategic Utilization of Cellular Operator Energy Storage for Smart Grid Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11049663</link><description>The innovative use of cellular operator energy storage enhances power grid resilience and efficiency. Traditionally used to ensure uninterrupted operation of cellular base stations (BSs) during grid outages, these storage can now dynamically participate in the energy flexibility market. This dual utilization enhances the economic viability of BS storage systems and supports sustainable energy management. In this paper, we explore the potential of BS storage for supporting grid ancillary services by allocating a portion of their capacity while ensuring Ultra Reliable Low Latency (URLLC) requirements, such as meeting delay and reliability requirements. This includes feeding BS stored energy back into the grid during high-demand periods or powering BSs to regulate grid frequency. We investigate the impacts of URLLC requirements on grid frequency regulation, formulating a joint resource allocation problem. This problem maximizes total revenues of cellular networks, considering both the total sum rate in the communication network and BS storage participation in frequency regulation, while considering battery aging and cycling constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the power compensation capabilities of a cellular network while balancing communication and frequency regulation requirements. By optimizing reliability and delay parameters, the system enhances energy efficiency and contributes to the stability of the power grid.</description></item><item><title>RoadPowerFM: Graphormer-JEPA-Based Foundation Model for Road-Power Coupling Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11030813</link><description>Coupling effects in road-power coupling networks (RPCNs) attract increasing attention, as they are crucial for addressing the road-power intertwined challenges caused by the rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs).

This paper develops a multiple-time-scale coordinated deep expert system framework that predicts the load demand of public, highway, and bus EVCSs. In the framework, the expert inference engine generates both the quarter-hourly and monthly predictions. For quarter-hourly load predictions, a stack ensemble learning strategy is proposed to combine heterogeneous neural network methods in a scalable, modular manner. Then, the multivariate data, regularized according to EVCS types and TOU rates, is processed via seasonal and trend decomposition using Loess (STL), and the daily profiles are grouped through multivariate time series K-Means clustering to ensure the consistency of the STL trend. For monthly energy predictions, a multi-matrix elastic net using blockwise coordinate descent is designed to correlate the remainder predictions (offered by the short-term engine and aggregated into monthly intervals) and the trend component (with cluster labels of ECVS types and TOU rates). In the case study, a real-world dataset with volatility is used, such that the proposed framework is implemented to show that forecast combinations can leverage multiple preferences, and short-term predictions can improve monthly performance.</description></item><item><title>An Equity-Aware Residential EV Charging Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11039745</link><description>The shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) in the near future is undeniable. With the integration of EVs, rising charging demands pose voltage challenges to the distribution grid. The voltage-based controlled EV charging proposed by the existing literature to manage the distribution system voltages usually has inherent locational disadvantages and can lead to inequitable or unfair EV charging. This paper proposes EqV-Volt charging control, which is an equity-aware, var-supported, voltage-based local EV charging control with no communication requirements. It uses a small percent of bi-directional charger capacity to provide var support to local point-of-charge voltage, and the EV is charged with the maximum possible charging power. The proposed charging control combines volt/watt and volt/var control based on local voltage feedback. A mathematical model of control is formulated, and its stability analysis, along with the model validation, is provided. A charging equity index is introduced to quantify equity awareness of charging control. The proposed control provides fair EV charging and keeps system voltage within stability limits. Validation is provided through multi-day phasor simulations in MATLAB/Simulink on a modified IEEE 33-bus system with 1440 EVs.</description></item><item><title>Edge Computing-Enabled Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading in a Local Energy Community</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021432</link><description>Local energy communities establish a platform for prosumers and consumers to share surplus generation via peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. Traditional optimization techniques for energy management problems necessitate precise models and accurate predictions. In contrast, reinforcement learning has gained widespread attention as it can handle system uncertainties without relying on models. However, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches for P2P energy trading involve a large volume of communications and computations, hindering the practical deployment of decision-making algorithms on edge devices whose communication and computation resources are very limited. To this end, this paper proposes an efficient and privacy-preserving MARL approach for edge computing-enabled P2P energy trading. Specifically, we design an information interaction framework that shares representations rather than sensitive observations to protect the privacy of various agents. In addition, we develop an event-triggered communication approach that controls the frequency of interactions through a gating mechanism to reduce communication overhead among agents. To save the memory footprint of each agent, we investigate an evolutionary training method that updates the networks using perturbation without backward gradient computation. Case studies on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our proposed method yields significant efficiency improvements while maintaining high decision-making performance.</description></item><item><title>Partial Information Perturbation-Based Specified Time Consensus With Asynchronous Switching: A Distributed Energy Dispatching Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11011922</link><description>With the widespread integration of distributed renewable energy, traditional centralized dispatching architectures face challenges in robustness and flexibility. It is essential to develop distributed energy optimization strategies to enhance the efficient utilization of renewable energy. Nevertheless, the exchange of information in distributed dispatching task execution entails potential risks of sensitive data exposure. This paper aims to investigate an improved privacy masking-based distributed privacy-preserving specified-time consensus algorithm for the economic dispatch problem (EDP) in energy systems (ESs). Therein, a privacy protection mechanism suitable for directed graphs is proposed by integrating state decomposition mechanisms and privacy masking techniques, ensuring both the accuracy of optimal solutions for EDP and the generality of communication topologies. Under this mechanism, a consensus algorithm with specified time performance is introduced, eliminating complex parameter constraints associated with predefined time bounds in distributed tasks. Additionally, an asynchronous switching law is incorporated into the privacy-preserving consensus protocol, allowing the algorithm to better adapt to environmental changes and dynamic parameter adjustments. Finally, the proposed method is applied to solve EDP in combined heat and power (CHP)-based ESs, demonstrating its excellent convergence and privacy performance.</description></item><item><title>Quantum Computing for Stochastic Economic Dispatch in Renewables-Rich Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11015516</link><description>Scenario-based stochastic optimization is a prevalent method for the economic dispatch of renewables-rich power systems. To reduce the time and space complexities for generating massive scenarios and solving pertinent mixed-integer stochastic optimization efficiently, quantum computing can provide critical assistance. To this end, we first propose the unified quantum amplitude estimation (UQAE) to generate massive scenarios with quadratic acceleration by a few qubits, after which the dimension of state variables embedded in the two-stage stochastic optimization also decreases exponentially. Then, by utilizing quantum-classical Benders decomposition, we accelerate the mixed integer master problem in the first stage on quantum processing units, while convex subproblems are solved on central processing units. Especially considering limited qubits in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, we propose to reduce the scale of master problem by scenario clustering and cut selection using the customized quantum approximation optimization algorithm (QAOA). Mathematically, we not only prove the decreases of complexities by UQAE-QAOA but also give the feasible ranges of penalty factors for transforming constrained problems into Ising models. Finally, we perform numerical experiments on modified IEEE systems to test the efficiency and accuracy of UQAE-QAOA, as well as the scalability of the designed quantum scheme.</description></item><item><title>LCL-AKA: Lightweight Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol for Power IoT</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016791</link><description>The rapid adoption of power Internet of Things (PIoT) systems has made security a critical concern, particularly as existing certificateless authentication and key agreement (CL-AKA) protocols face three fundamental limitations that hinder their practical deployment: excessive computational overhead from multi-round interactions, inadequate protection against advanced cryptanalytic attacks, and inflexible architectures unsuitable for dynamic grid environments. To tackle the previously mentioned challenges, this paper proposes lightweight authentication and key agreement protocol (LCL-AKA) for PIoT. Firstly, this protocol efficiently completes the process of identity authentication and session key agreement within a single round of communication interaction, significantly reducing computational costs and improving communication efficiency.

These attacks, especially when launched from multiple points, present serious risks to the stability and security of the LFC system by corrupting critical measurement data. This paper proposes novel multipoint FDI attack detection and defense methods based on temporal analysis neural networks to increase the resilience of LFC systems under attack. Specifically, a data-driven dual-layer long short-term memory (DL-LSTM) attack detector is designed for efficient detection of multipoint FDI attacks. The method leverages a hierarchical LSTM architecture to capture temporal dependencies effectively and identify attack patterns within time series data. Moreover, a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU)-based defense method is proposed to mitigate the impact of such attacks, leveraging its superior performance in time series data prediction to ensure effective postattack defense. The proposed detection and defense mechanism is validated through simulations on a smart grid with three-area LFC systems, incorporating the practical complexities of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) links, renewable energy sources (RESs), and system nonlinearities, demonstrating its effectiveness in attack detection and its promising applicability to complex power grid environments.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Asynchronous Federated Learning for Digital Twin Driven Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11036541</link><description>The smart grid represents a revolutionary advancement, ushering power systems into an era of enhanced intelligence. Unlike traditional power networks, smart grids demand superior real-time performance, security, and accuracy. However, their development faces significant challenges, including delays in device status updates, malicious station attacks, and a lack of user trust, which impede service quality improvements. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Privacy-Preserving Smart Grid distributed Collaborative computing system (PPSG) that integrates blockchain and asynchronous federated learning technologies. A digital twin framework tailored for smart grids is designed, enabling real-time simulation and reflection of electrical devices&#8217; states and behaviors, thereby enhancing service responsiveness. Additionally, to tackle non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data and outdated local models, a dual dynamic aggregation factor asynchronous federated learning scheme is introduced, improving service accuracy. The &#8220;Proof of Contribution&#8221; blockchain consensus algorithm is employed to assess contributions to computational tasks and utilize stochastic processes to mitigate election fraud, thereby strengthening security. Extensive comparative experiments on Non-IID datasets and heterogeneous devices demonstrate PPSG&#8217;s superior learning performance, efficiency, and reliability. Furthermore, experiments using real power grid datasets validate its practical applicability, scalability in large-scale node environments, and feasibility for real-world deployment.</description></item><item><title>Edge Resilient Control for Feeder Automation System Under Hybrid Attacks: A Hybrid Physical Model-Driven and Data-Driven Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045218</link><description>The extensive application of the distributed feeder automation system (DFAs) is a prominent feature of the power distribution system (PDS). To enhance the resilience of DFAs to cyberattacks and hybrid attacks (contains both physical and cyber-attacks), this paper proposes an edge resilient control approach (ERCA) for DFAs, which integrates attack detection and mitigation. Two key modules are developed: 1) Edge Cyberattack Detection and Correction Module (ECDCM), achieving quick cyberattack detection and correction based on machine learning and physical constraints; 2) Consensus-based Fault Section Localization Module (CFSLM), which incorporates causality function related to agent overcurrent states and fault location to correctly localize the fault section in hybrid attack scenarios. In addition, the effective boundaries of ERCA are theoretically deduced in this paper, which proves that ERCA can retain resilience to cyberattacks and hybrid attacks even if undetected cyberattacks exist due to the failures of machine learning-based detection submodules. Finally, the proposal&#8217;s effectiveness and performance are tested and verified using the IEEE 123-bus system and the real two-feeder test platform with DFAs. By adopting ERCA, outages and load losses caused by cyber attacks are 100% avoided, and the fault caused by physical attack is correctly isolated with more than 97.6% reliability in 100,000 times-level Monte Carlo Numerical simulations of hybrid attacks.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Resilient Unit Commitment Supported by Battery-Electric Locomotives Under Decision-Dependent Uncertainties</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073155</link><description>Battery-electric locomotives (BELs) offer a promising solution for long-distance energy exchange in power systems. To address the challenge of random transmission line failures under uncertain routing before hurricanes, this paper proposes a proactive resilience-enhancing scheduling strategy that adeptly integrates unit commitment (UC), energy storage plants, and BELs. The problem is formulated as a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (T-DRO) model with risk aversion. To manage decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) arising from BEL routing decisions and distributional ambiguity caused by limited outage information during hurricanes, an event-based decision-dependent ambiguity set (DD-AS) with  $L_{1}$  distance is developed, which captures random failures in both transmission lines and railway networks to construct a decision-dependent sample space. Using Lagrangian dual method, the optimization problem is reformulated and decoupled into deterministic master problems and subproblems. An enhanced Benders decomposition algorithm with hybrid cuts techniques is designed to solve the proposed T-DRO under event-based DD-AS. The advantage of this algorithm over classical Benders decomposition method is theoretically interpreted. The proposed model and algorithm are tested on the modified IEEE reliability test system (RTS) under a hurricane to verify their effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced GAN-Based Joint Wind-Solar-Load Scenario Generation With Extreme Weather Labelling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11012665</link><description>The high penetration of renewable energy and frequent extreme weather events bring significant uncertainty to the operation and planning of power systems. The extreme scenarios exhibit high impact and low probability characteristics, posing a challenge in providing sufficient and reliable samples for power system decision-making.

Given the intrinsic uncertainty and variability associated with various connected resources as well as their aggregated representation, generating diverse load scenarios is of great significance for system planning, operation, and control. However, traditional time series statistical methods, in the absence of supplementary meteorological data, have limited capabilities in accurately generating load scenarios. To address such issues, this paper proposes an Optical Flow Denoising Diffusion Transformer model (OFDDT) to generate representative load scenarios. Specifically, the optical flow denoising diffusion module is adopted to capture load fluctuation characteristics influenced by the temperature, while the Transformer module integrates variability and historical load features to generate load profile scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in such load scenario generation tasks, outperforming traditional generative artificial intelligence models.</description></item><item><title>EnergyDiff: Universal Time-Series Energy Data Generation Using Diffusion Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11049025</link><description>High-resolution time series data are crucial for the operation and planning of energy systems such as electrical power systems and heating systems. Such data often cannot be shared due to privacy concerns, necessitating the use of synthetic data. However, high-resolution time series data is difficult to model due to its inherent high dimensionality and complex temporal dependencies. Leveraging the recent development of generative AI, especially diffusion models, we propose EnergyDiff, a universal data generation framework for energy time series data. EnergyDiff builds on state-of-the-art denoising diffusion probabilistic models, utilizing a proposed denoising network dedicated to high-resolution time series data and introducing a novel Marginal Calibration technique. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that EnergyDiff achieves significant improvement in capturing the temporal dependencies and marginal distributions compared to baselines, particularly at the 1-minute resolution. EnergyDiff&#8216;s universality is validated across diverse energy domains (e.g., electricity demand, heat pump, PV), multiple time resolutions (1 minute, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 1 hour), and at both customer and transformer levels.</description></item><item><title>Load Frequency Control of Multi-Microgrids Based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Integrated With Online Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11075888</link><description>The integration of wind power into microgrids significantly increases the complexity of the microgrid&#8217;s dynamical behavior and introduces higher levels of uncertainty. This paper addresses load frequency control (LFC) in wind-diesel multi-microgrids by exploiting a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) method. The proposed method derives coordinated control strategies for multiple LFC controllers by combining offline centralized learning with online learning. During offline centralized learning, a neural network based on Long-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is applied to learn the dynamical behavior of the multi-microgrids. The LSTM-based network updates actor networks to estimate the optimal control policy from the global action-value function. Online learning integrates with offline training, allows the LSTM-based network to adapt to dynamic changes of the microgrid and bridges the gap between training and real-time application. Simulations on a wind-diesel three-microgrid and the New England 10-generator 39 test bus validate the method&#8217;s effectiveness in improving the control performance of the microgrid.</description></item><item><title>Topology Guided Network Clustering and Allocation of Edge Estimation Points for Monitoring of Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11039110</link><description>Managing extensive measurement sets in the power system for state estimation (SE) leads to communication burden and delays. To address the above challenge, this paper explores the concept of edge computing, offering robust support for real-time SE. The method involves dividing the large-scale network into clusters, ensuring balanced cluster sizes in the three-phase distribution network, thereby reducing SE runtime. Additionally, edge estimation points (EEPs) are strategically allocated to minimize distances to the data sources and other EEPs, effectively reducing communication delays. Building upon this approach, a constrained multi-objective optimization problem is formulated with four objectives in the network, incorporating limited measurements from microphasor measurement units ( $\mu $  PMUs) and remote terminal units (RTUs). The paper introduces a modified Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II), which combines guided radial mutation and trait crossover and utilizes partition topologies to expedite optimization. It reduces mathematical formulation complexity through gene regulation and real value encoding for improved efficiency. A comprehensive analysis of the IEEE 123 and 37-bus systems has been conducted, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed formulations in addressing the specified objectives and adeptly managing associated trade-offs.

We leverage the ability of the LLM to perform in-context learning and create a topology-adaptive surrogate model for power flow calculation. The surrogate model is then integrated with a long short-term memory-based load forecaster and a model predictive control (MPC) scheme to achieve the optimal inverter control that adapts to frequent topology changes. Unlike many existing works that assume fixed-topology grids or require the knowledge of all possible topologies when training a model, the proposed in-context MPC method tackles the distribution voltage control problem under various topologies and adapts to unknown topologies with limited data requirement for fine-tuning. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on a modified IEEE 123-bus test system.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Eco-Driving for Heavy Vehicle Platooning: An Iterative Learning-Based Integrated Speed Planning and Control Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980023</link><description>Eco-driving for vehicle platoons has attracted significant research interest due to its potential to improve traffic efficiency and reduce energy consumption by optimizing vehicle speed trajectories and inter-vehicle spacing. This paper presents a Data-Efficient Iterative Learning-based (DEIL) method for integrated speed planning and control, specifically designed for heavy-duty vehicle platoons. The proposed approach formulates the problem as a finite-horizon constrained optimization, that incorporates both a terminal energy cost and a time-domain-guided terminal safe constraint set. Unlike conventional optimization methods that rely on a one-time pre-planned reference speed, the DEIL leverages historical vehicle states and energy consumption data from previous iterations to approximate the terminal cost and constraint set, enabling closed-loop, data-efficient iterative learning. The approximated terminal energy cost decreases monotonically and converges, facilitating the derivation of an energy-optimal control strategy within a limited number of iterations. Moreover, the method integrates trajectory planning and tracking control without requiring predefined reference profiles. To improve computational efficiency, a dynamic programming (DP) strategy is employed to generate the initial feasible trajectory. Comparative analysis validates the proposed approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing energy-optimal trajectories and control strategies for heavy vehicle platooning.</description></item><item><title>Consensus Control of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations for Providing Performance-Based Frequency Regulation Service</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10985859</link><description>Energy storage plays a significant role in the modern power grid with high penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources. The flexible charging of numerous grid-connected electric vehicles (EVs) is exploited to act as mobile energy storage for power balancing services. This paper proposes a consensus-based control strategy for EV charging stations providing frequency regulation with limited communication among neighbors. The multi-layer control strategy is operated in the agent of each EV charging station. The charging power of EVs are controlled to track the frequency regulation signals depending on the capacity bid submitted to the market within the adjustable range of EV charging power. The algorithm also allocates the frequency regulation power according to the regulation capability of each EV station while satisfying the diverse charging needs of EVs. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is investigated on a typical power distribution network with EV charging stations scattered on several feeders. The quality of frequency regulation is assessed by the performance indicators specified by the PJM market (ISO in the United States). A high-performance score that guarantees the entire payment of frequency regulation can be achieved without violating the charging demand of EVs and the power network constraints.</description></item><item><title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Power Efficiency Physical Layer Security in Uplink Multiple-User Channel</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11059279</link><description>This article investigates the radio frequency (RF) power efficiency issue of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted physical layer security (PLS) in multiple-user uplink channels. Traditional methodologies relying on secrecy rate metrics prove impractical when faced with unknown eavesdropper channel state information (CSI). To tackle this issue, the concept of secrecy outage probability is introduced within IRS-assisted PLS. This paper formulates the total RF power minimization problem of multiple users in the uplink channel, considering scenarios where the eavesdropper's CSI is unknown. An alternating optimization scheme is proposed to address the problem via alternately optimizing the RF power of individual users, receiving beamforming vectors, and phase shift matrix, minimizing the total RF power while ensuring compliance with secrecy outage probability constraints. Innovative methodologies, such as manifold optimization, dynamic weighted quadratic transformation, and deep learning, are proposed to approximate optimal solutions and reduce complexity in phase shift optimization. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme markedly decreases RF power, with the DL-based approach demonstrating satisfactory performance while substantially reducing time complexity.</description></item><item><title>IRS-Assisted AAV-MEC-NOMA Networks: A Joint Optimization Design for Computational Capacity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002461</link><description>To cope with the challenges of traditional mobile edge computing (MEC), such as inflexibility and limited coverage, autonomousaerial vehicle (AAV)-MEC has been proposed as an important paradigm. However, the AAV-MEC systems are still facing the severe channel fading and obstacle blocking, which are fortunately expected to be solved by the emerging intelligent reflective surface (IRS) technique. In this paper, we propose an IRS-assisted AAV-MEC framework, where a AAV employs non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme to offload partial computation tasks to multiple ground MEC servers connecting to access points (APs) with the assistance of IRS. The problem of maximizing computational capacity of the network is proposed by jointly optimizing the phase shift of IRS, transmit power and computation resource allocation of AAV, NOMA decoding order, and AAV trajectory. Due to the complex non-convexity of the problem, we decompose the original problem into three sub-problems based on the alternating optimization (AO) structure. To be specific, we first derive the IRS reflection phase shift by using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and concave-convex procedure (CCCP) methods. Then, we obtain the computation and communication resource allocation by using the CCCP method. Finally, we determine the optimal AAV trajectory and decoding order by using the successive convex approximation (SCA) approach and the penalty-based method. A joint optimization algorithm is proposed for the AAV-MEC-NOMA framework. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) The proposed algorithm is efficient and superior to other benchmark schemes in terms of increasing computational capacity; 2) The application of IRS significantly enhances the computation capability of the network; 3) The NOMA scheme outperforms the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme.</description></item><item><title>Robust Optimization for Multi-STAR-IRS-Aided Multi-Cell Communication System Based on GNN-Enhanced Partially Distributed Multi-Agent</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981963</link><description>Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting intelligent reflecting surface (STAR-IRS) is recognized as a promising auxiliary technology to enhance the coverage of networks. In this work, we study a multi-STAR-IRS-assisted downlink multi-cell communication system in which STAR-IRSs are strategically deployed within cells to assist transmission from base stations (BSs) to user equipments (UEs). We aim to maximize energy efficiency by designing robust beamforming for active beamforming matrices at all BSs, passive reflection beamforming, and transmission beamforming matrices at all STAR-IRSs in the presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI). Due to the non-convexity of the original optimization problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm is developed. Initially, the optimization problem is modeled as a multi-agent Markov decision problem. Next, to reduce interaction among cells, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-enhanced partially distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm, based on a centralized training and decentralized execution framework. Therein, the agents alternatively learn robust policies for beamforming optimization against channel errors, where the robust training strategy is applied for training networks to narrow the mismatch between the perfect and imperfect CSI. Additionally, GNNs are incorporated to facilitate effective collaboration within cell agents. Simulation results confirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its superior system energy efficiency performance compared to benchmarks. Moreover, the results reveal the robustness of the proposed algorithm against imperfect CSI and its ability to reduce the performance gap with the perfect CSI-based system.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Noncoherent Joint Transmission Based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Dense Small Cell MISO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981942</link><description>This paper investigates the sum rate maximization problem in dense small cell (DSC) networks, where multi-antenna small cell base stations (SBSs) serve single-antenna users over a shared frequency band using noncoherent joint transmission (JT). While noncoherent JT enhances capacity by enabling users to receive signals from multiple coordinated SBSs, its practical deployment is hindered by the nonconvex and NP-hard nature of the optimization problem, along with the high-dimensional continuous optimization variables. Existing optimization-based approaches, despite achieving near-optimal performance, require global channel state information (CSI) and multiple iterations, making them impractical for DSC networks. To overcome these challenges, we first prove that the optimal beamforming structure is the same for both the power minimization problem and the sum rate maximization problem, and then mathematically derive the optimal beamforming structure for both problems by solving the power minimization problem. The optimal beamforming structure can effectively reduces the variable dimensions. By exploiting the optimal beamforming structure, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient-based distributed noncoherent JT scheme to maximize the system sum rate. In the proposed scheme, each SBS utilizes global information for training and uses local CSI to determine beamforming vectors. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves comparable performance with considerably lower computational complexity and information overhead compared to centralized iterative optimization-based techniques, making it more attractive for practical deployment.</description></item><item><title>Mitigating Phase Errors to Improve Signal Quality in RIS-Assisted Satellite Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988668</link><description>This research presents an advanced framework designed to enhance the received power in satellite-to-Earth communications by utilizing Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), with a focus on mitigating phase errors that arise from hardware imperfections associated with RIS systems. A comprehensive analysis of the phase errors arising from these imperfections is conducted, leading to the development of a robust analytical model that quantitatively incorporates these errors into the assessment of received power evaluations. Subsequently, we propose a methodology to selectively exclude RIS elements that are prone to errors, thereby improving the phase alignment of the received signal and enhancing overall system efficiency. While this strategy leads to a marginal decrease in received power, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is employed to optimize the RIS configuration, maintaining the desired power levels and ensuring signal integrity. The research also delves into the complexities introduced by shadowing effects combined with phase errors. To address these compounded challenges, a decision-making framework utilizing targeted BO is introduced to dynamically optimize RIS configurations, thereby enhancing system robustness and performance under adverse operational conditions. Numerical simulations validate the framework's efficacy in adaptively managing RIS elements, ensuring robust signal integrity and improved reception despite variations stemming from environmental and hardware factors.

Given the problem's complexity and the interdependence of variables, we propose a two-stage decentralized proximal policy optimization (DPPO) algorithm to effectively manage the high-dimensional decision space. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm reduces the long-term energy cost by approximately 17% compared to existing methods, while ensuring that tasks are completed within the latency constraints.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Secure Fault-Tolerant Formation Splitting Control for Multiagent Systems Under Cooperation-Antagonism Interactions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11028136</link><description>In this paper, a formation splitting control problem for multiagent systems (MASs) under actuator failures and communication attacks is investigated. By assigning positive and negative edge weights (cooperative and antagonistic interactions) to the interaction topology among agents, formation splitting can be achieved without the need to plan multiple leaders' trajectories. In addition, considering that communication attacks will inevitably cause damage to the cooperation-antagonism network, as well as the impact of multiplicative faults on control inputs, it is crucial to design a control protocol that does not rely on global topology and contains dynamic gain. Thus, based on gauge transformation and adaptive mechanism, a fully distributed secure fault-tolerant formation splitting control protocol is designed. Considering that the energy of attackers is usually limited, based on a slowly switching mechanism, the sufficient conditions to ensure the implementation of secure fault-tolerant formation splitting under different degrees of communication attacks are provided. Finally, the correctness of the theoretical analysis is verified by simulation.</description></item><item><title>Task Offloading in UAV-Assisted Mobile Cloud-Edge Computing Networks: An AoP-Aware HAPPO Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981970</link><description>In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with edge servers have emerged to expand service coverage. However, their inherent limitations in bandwidth, computational capacity, and energy resources restrict their ability to meet the demands of computation-intensive applications. To overcome these challenges, an air-ground collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC) network with enhanced resources is employed to improve Quality of Service (QoS). This network can provide support for a wide range of real-time applications where the computed results are critical.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel UAV-mounted reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted approach, where the RIS is mounted on the UAV for enhancing/suppressing its reflected signal towards the L/U to facilitate/prevent its detection of the UAV. Furthermore, the UAV target can also adjust its flight route to move closer to/away from the L/U to improve/decrease the sensing performance. Due to the mobility of both the shipborne radars and UAVs, the Doppler shift effects of the RIS-ship channel need to be considered. In such a setup, the maximization of the received power at the L is formulated into an optimization problem while suppressing the received power at the U below a certain threshold by jointly designing the reflecting phase shifts of RIS and the 3D flight trajectory of UAV. The non-convex optimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems and solved via an iterative algorithm.

In particular, with fixed and dynamic power-splitting relaying (PSR) protocols, we analyze the system performance of a decode-and-forward (DF) EH relay network using a throughput metric with rate selection capability. It shows that employing a novel multi-rate scheme improves the throughput drastically over a single rate. Furthermore, we consider joint optimization of the PSR parameter denoted by $\rho$ and rate selection quality-of-service (RQ) parameter denoted by $\delta$, which determines the number of transmission rates in the feasible transmission range. In the case of statistical channel state information (CSI) availability, the joint optimization of PSR and RQ parameters is achieved through the 2D golden section search (2D-GSS) method. Closed-form expressions for the optimal $\rho$ and $\delta$ are obtained in case of instantaneous CSI availability. The numerical results demonstrate that the joint parameter optimization with instantaneous CSI provides better performance, and the obtained insights are crucial to improve quality-of-service in energy-constrained wireless networks.</description></item><item><title>Active STAR-RIS Assisted Covert Communications Against a Proactive Warden</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981608</link><description>In this correspondence, we investigate covert communications assisted by an active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (aSTAR-RIS) in the presence of a proactive warden.

We consider that the proactive warden introduces additional interference channels, which affects the minimum error detection probability (DEP) at the warden. The DEP is derived and is influenced by the transmit power and interference power. Additionally, we propose an optimization framework to maximize the covert rate of the system while considering the constraints of transmitting power and covertness. The simulation results demonstrate that the proactive warden pose more challenges to covert systems compared to the passive warden.

This paper investigates cooperative downlink (DL) transmission from multiple LEO satellites by using distributed beamforming, considering the inevitable delay and Doppler compensation errors that impact coherent processing. Firstly, we establish the DL transmission signal model for multiple LEO satellites with delay and Doppler compensation errors. On this basis, we design the transmitters and receivers to maximize the average signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio. Then, we analyze the DL transmission performance via deriving lower bounds and closed-form expressions for both the user rate and the average rate gain of cooperative transmission compared to single LEO satellite transmission. We prove that as the number of receiving antennas at the UT increases, the impact of imperfect compensation on the user rate decreases, and the average rate gain improves. In addition, we prove that the UT can achieve the optimal average rate gain when its array response vectors corresponding to different LEO satellites are orthogonal. Simulations are performed and compared to the theoretical analysis, demonstrating the performance gains brought by distributed beamforming and validating our analysis.</description></item><item><title>Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for Secure Energy Efficiency in Wireless Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11026784</link><description>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a potential technology for the design of 6G wireless communication systems. However, the &#8220;double fading&#8221; effect in the principal reflection link limits its practical development. In this paper, we explore the use of active RIS (ARIS) to enhance a downlink multiple-input-single-output (MISO) system in the presence of a single eavesdropper (Eve) whose channel state information (CSI) is imperfect. We fomulate a secure energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problem which is addressed by jointly optimizing the BS transmit beamforming and the ARIS reflection coefficient matrix. We first decompose the SEE into a linear function exploiting a quadratic transform. The uncertainty of the channels related to the Eve is approximated by using the S-Procedure. Then, we apply the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to handle the non-convexity. An alternating optimization (AO) framework is proposed to address the coupled variables.</description></item><item><title>The Impact of Spectral Irradiance Aggregation Into Kato Bands and PV-Bands on Estimates of Photovoltaic Spectral Effects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11121565</link><description>Full-resolution spectral irradiance data can comprise upwards of 2000&#8211;3000 data points at a single time step. Given that photovoltaic (PV) modeling is regularly performed with subhourly time resolutions over multiyear periods, incorporating spectral effects can become challenging both in terms of file sizes and computational burden. For this reason, spectral irradiances are sometimes aggregated into a limited number of wavelength bands (or wavebands), such as the 32-band grouping known as Kato bands that is used in the IEC 61853 series of standards on &#8220;PV module performance testing and energy rating.&#8221; To test the impact of such aggregation, measured, and modeled spectral irradiance data from two sites in the United States&#8212;Tempe, Arizona and Golden, Colorado&#8212;are used to assess the impact on PV spectral effect estimates of aggregating spectral irradiances into Kato bands and into two other sets of wavebands known as PV-bands. Calculations using the aggregated spectra are compared with those using the full-resolution spectra, for crystalline silicon and cadmium telluride modules. Each of the three sets of wavebands yields negligible errors of less than 0.1% in the spectral derate factor, which characterizes long-term spectral effects. This indicates that both Kato bands and PV-bands should be sufficient for the purposes of PV energy rating. Meanwhile, a recent version of PV-bands performs best for evaluating the instantaneous spectral mismatch factor, leading to errors of less than 0.2% across all time steps for both sites and PV module technologies, while instantaneous errors for Kato bands reach magnitudes of up to 1.4%.</description></item><item><title>Voltage-Matched All-Perovskite Double- and Triple-Junction Solar Modules for Building-Integrated Photovoltaics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045357</link><description>We designed multijunction solar modules for installation on building walls, in which all the submodules are composed of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells, adopting the monolithically series-interconnected structures. Prior to considering concrete module configurations, we elucidated that the impacts of temporal and regional variations in the solar spectra on the vertically wall-installed modules are more notable than those on the modules installed on rooftops and in solar farms at the optimal tilt angles. As a result, the annually averaged conversion efficiencies for the double-junction (2J) modules of the conventional two-terminal configuration and other configurations that require the current matching between the top and bottom modules are notably degraded. By contrast, the voltage-matched (VM) 2J modules, in which the submodules yielding approximately the same maximal-power voltages (VMP) are connected in parallel, ensure high conversion efficiencies close to those for the four-terminal (4T) 2J modules even when wall installed because VMP is less sensitive to solar-spectrum variation than the photocurrents. The single output of the VM 2J modules is practically a great advantage over the dual output of the 4T 2J modules. An improved variant: the series&#8211;parallel-connecting VM triple-junction modules, in which the two-terminal middle/bottom modules are parallel connected with the top modules, further improve the conversion efficiencies under all the installation conditions.</description></item><item><title>A Solar PV-Based Compact EV Charging Solution for On-Board Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029121</link><description>This work is focused on a solar photovoltaics (PV)-based onboard charger using reconfigured motor windings. In the proposed scheme, the motor windings and traction converter switches form a three-phase interleaved buck converter (IBC). The IBC is interfaced with the solar PV and acts as the maximum power point tracking converter. The IBC reduces the current ripple at the battery side and improves the battery cycle life. Through IBC, a large amount of current at the battery side is paralleled in three inductors of the IBC, which reduces the on-state losses in the switches and copper loss in the inductors. Therefore, it is possible to increase the power level of the onboard charging system as high as that of the propulsion system with enhanced compactness of the system while reducing the cost. Moreover, the applied control strategy reduces the current sensor requirements in IBC and eliminates the proportional&#8211;integral controller, which is another major advantage of the proposed system compared to conventional control of the IBC. Furthermore, the switches are subjected to zero current switching. Finally, the real-time experiment of the proposed system was accomplished using the OPAL-RT platform for 6 kW of charging power.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Methodology for Solar Tracker Performance Assessment and Energy Loss Quantification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11062883</link><description>The optimal functioning of large-scale photovoltaic installations relies on effective monitoring of tracking systems.

Aerial infrared thermography has enabled fast and robust fault detection in utility-scale PV plants. In this article, we explore two key approaches to improve inspection efficiency: increase the flight altitude and deploy swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles. A larger imaging distance expands the field of view but reduces fault detectability and georeferencing accuracy. In this work, we study the tradeoff between inspection efficiency and data quality for automatic fault detection and localization. The YOLO11 machine learning model was trained to detect defects in thermal images, and its performance was evaluated to vary imaging distances and camera pitch angles. Fault detection remained robust up to approximately 80 m, but georeferencing error became the primary limiting factor. Finally, we conduct a UAV swarm-based inspection of a PV plant, integrating automatic fault detection and localization, and compare the results with ground truth data.</description></item><item><title>A Study of Signed-Digit Hybrid Stochastic Number for Arithmetic Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879131</link><description>In this article, a signed-digit hybrid stochastic number (SD-HSN), which combines the two-line bipolar stochastic number (TLB-SN) and the binary signed-digit (BSD) number, is proposed and discussed. As a bipolar format hybrid stochastic number (SN), SD-HSN extends the concept of conventional TLB-SN to a signed-digit stochastic stream. The positional-weight-based TLB-SNs are still a stochastic stream with BSD, which is computed according to the arithmetic of its expectation with the redundant number method. The multiplication by SD-HSN shows a high-computational performance thanks to the redundant SD-HSN circuit. The efficient multiply-accumulate (MAC) is implemented by SD-HSN designs with low area and low-power consumption. The fault tolerance mechanism of SD-HSN is demonstrated by a JPEG image compression algorithm and a neural network. Besides, SD-HSN shows its advantage in hardware cost and power consumption over conventional BSD number multiplication and its high accuracy, high efficiency, and low latency compared to the classic stochastic computing (SC) methods. The SD-HSN circuits proposed, which include a generator, adder, and multiplier, are designed and implemented based on a standard 40-nm CMOS process.</description></item><item><title>MSDF-Based MAC for Energy-Efficient Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10893701</link><description>This article presents an energy-efficient serial multiply-accumulate (MAC) unit based on the most significant digit first (MSDF) approach, specifically aimed at neural networks operating in resource-constrained and low-energy environments. The proposed MAC unit has been integrated into two neural network architectures: a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a denoising autoencoder. For the MLP, we employ a pre-trained model for handwritten digit classification using the Modified National Institute of Standard and Technology (MNIST) dataset. Hardware synthesis using 45 nm CMOS technology shows that the MSDF-based MLP achieves a favorable trade-off between hardware metrics, such as reduced circuit area and energy per neuron, and reaches a good classification accuracy of 97.4%. In the case of the autoencoder, the proposed MAC unit is utilized in a pre-trained denoising autoencoder for the same dataset. The autoencoder employs MSDF-based mixed precision across layers to reduce computational resources and loads while preserving high-quality image reconstruction. A comprehensive evaluation of image correctness, signal fidelity, and visual quality metrics was conducted to assess the impact of varying precision levels across different layers. The results indicate that the proposed approach achieves an effective denoising performance with balanced hardware requirements.</description></item><item><title>IoT-Edge Splitting With Pruned Early-Exit CNNs for Adaptive Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909993</link><description>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are driving the Internet of Things (IoT) revolution. To manage latency and privacy concerns in this domain, IoT devices may offload partial or full DNN processing to nearby edge servers rather than relying only on the cloud. In this scenario, while field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are efficient and provide flexibility for these resource-constrained IoT and edge devices, runtime optimizations like pruning and early exit can deliver further improvements. However, they need to be applied with careful design, since offloading and split computing may require constant synchronization of such dynamic DNN models. With that in mind, this article introduces a framework that automatically constructs inference platforms combining pruning and early exit with FPGA-based offloading. It addresses the latency-power-accuracy tradeoff, adapting inference to the unpredictable conditions of IoT-edge environments. Using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as a case study, it achieves a reduction of up to  $1.6\times $  in latency and a  $3.9\times $  improvement in power efficiency, with minimal accuracy loss.</description></item><item><title>Design Space Exploration for Approximate Circuits via Checkpointing and DNN-Based Estimators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982122</link><description>Approximate computing (AC) is a design paradigm that trades in reductions in hardware area, power, and delay of digital circuits for an increased error. Workflows for synthesizing approximate accelerators are often implemented as search-approximate&#8211;evaluate cycles that build a search tree by iteratively approximating components of the original circuit. Design space exploration (DSE) for approximate accelerators is challenging due to the sheer size of the design space and the computational costs for validating the error bound during the search. While early work employed rather slow simulation-based methods, more recent approaches use machine learning (ML) to create fast estimators for validating error bounds. For larger accelerators and design spaces, however, the mispredictions of ML-based methods can steer the search process to explore invalid regions of the design space. In this article, we introduce the framework DeepApprox for approximate accelerator synthesis. The novelty of this framework is its combination of fast ML-based quality estimators with occasional simulations to correct possible mispredictions. The simulations are performed at the so-called checkpoints during the search, and we propose two methods: static and dynamic checkpointing (DC). We present the DeepApprox flow and elaborate on the ML quality estimators and the checkpointing mechanisms. Using a set of smaller and larger benchmarks, we compare DeepApprox with two state-of-the-art flows: a simulation-based method leveraging Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and an ML-based method with fast estimators. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepApprox can achieve similar reductions in hardware area and power consumption compared to simulation-based methods, albeit at much lower runtimes, and higher reductions in these metrics compared to methods relying exclusively on ML-based estimators. Thus, by combining ML-based techniques with simulations, DeepApprox provides a scalable DSE for approximate accelerators.</description></item><item><title>Cross-Layer Approximate Design of Low-Power Fractional Motion Estimation Accelerators for VVC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11115968</link><description>The versatile video coding (VVC) standard introduces several innovative tools designed to enhance coding efficiency compared with its predecessors. One example is the adoption of an alternative filter for fractional motion estimation (FME) that is part of the adaptive motion vector resolution (AMVR) extension. While this allows a more precise motion representation, it also incurs more complexity for hardware implementations that aim at supporting most of VVC features. This work introduces a low-power hardware architecture accelerator specifically designed for FME with support for the AMVR extension of VVC. The proposed solution enables a systematic exploration of the design space of cross-layer approximate computing by combining approximations at both the operator and algorithm levels. This is achieved through the design of two novel architectures (2TAxA/4T and 2TAxA/2TAxA) alongside a newly proposed approximate filter applicable to both regular and alternative interpolation modes. Furthermore, we evaluate eight different approximate adder (AA) topologies to optimize power&#8211;quality tradeoffs. Experimental results demonstrate that for a complete FME multifilter interpolation unit (MIU) and maintaining an image quality threshold of  $\text {SSIM} \geq 0.88$ , our method achieves up to 72% power savings and 59.64% area savings.</description></item><item><title>A Fourth-Order Tunable Bandwidth Gm-C Filter for ECG Detection Achieving &#8722;7.9 dBV IIP3 Under a 0.5 V Supply</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11030289</link><description>This article introduces a fourth-order  $G_{m}$ -C low-pass filter for ECG detection that achieves high linearity despite operating under a 0.5 V supply by 1) placing the differential pairs (DPs) of the employed  $G_{m}$  stages in a two-loop feedback structure, 2) employing body-driven rather than gate-driven  $G_{m}$  DPs, and 3) using current mirrors in place of cascoded transistors in a conventional  $G_{m}$  stage. Measurement results of a  $0.18~\mu $ m CMOS prototype show that the proposed filter, operating with a  $V_{\text {DD}}$  of 0.5 V, achieves an third-order harmonic distortion (HD3) below &#8722;40 dB for input amplitudes up to 340 mVpp. With an integrated noise of  $154.7~\mu $ Vrms over a 240-Hz bandwidth, the filter exhibits a dynamic range (DR) of 53.6 dB, which is competitive with previously reported works.</description></item><item><title>Low-Complexity Implementation of Real-Time Reconfigurable Low-Pass Equalizers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11074767</link><description>Implementation techniques and results for a recently proposed real-time reconfigurable low-pass equalizer (RLPE) consisting of a variable bandwidth (VBW) filter and a variable equalizer (VE) are presented. Both components utilize fixed finite-length impulse response (FIR) filters combined with a few general multipliers, resulting in lower area and power consumption compared to a general FIR filter, despite requiring more multiplications. This is because the constant multipliers in the fixed FIR filters of the RLPE can be optimized for implementation. An additional advantage is that the proposed RLPE does not require online design. Various implementation alternatives for fixed FIR filters, including ways to increase the frequency, are evaluated to optimize the implementation of the RLPE. Several versions of the proposed RLPE and a general FIR filter for comparison are implemented using a 28-nm fully depleted silicon on insulator (FD-SOI) standard cell library. The results demonstrate that the RLPE baseline design requires less power and area than the general equalizer, and although the frequency of the baseline implementation is lower, the design can reach the same frequency while still having significantly less power and area. Furthermore, an approach is introduced to break the chain in the polynomial section of the VBW filter by using fewer additional registers compared to standard pipelining. Instead, this method reformulates the constant multiplication problem to produce correct results. For the considered case, the power consumption is reduced between 49% and 70% for different frequencies, with an area decrease in the range of 64%&#8211;67%, by using the proposed RLPE compared to a general FIR filter.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Efficient Syndrome Calculation Architecture for BCH Decoders</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11076183</link><description>Syndrome calculation (SC) is a critical step in Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) decoding, and its computational efficiency significantly impacts the energy consumption of the entire decoder.

The proposed architecture fundamentally adopts a remainder-based SC, which consumes less energy than the conventional Horner&#8217;s method-based SC unit. Furthermore, unlike previous remainder-based approaches, it uses a minimal polynomial to produce a shorter remainder, leading to reduced computation and improved energy efficiency. Implementation results demonstrate an 80% improvement in energy efficiency compared to the latest Horner&#8217;s method-based SC unit and a 35% improvement compared to the previous remainder-based SC unit.</description></item><item><title>ReTern: Exploiting Natural Redundancy and Sign Transformations for Enhanced Fault Tolerance in Compute-in-Memory-Based Ternary LLMs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073133</link><description>Ternary large language models (LLMs), which use ternary precision weights and 8-bit activations, have demonstrated competitive performance while significantly reducing the high computational and memory requirements of full-precision LLMs. The energy efficiency and performance of ternary LLMs can be further improved by deploying them on ternary computing-in-memory (TCiM) accelerators, thereby alleviating the von-Neumann bottleneck. However, TCiM accelerators are prone to memory stuck-at faults (SAFs) leading to degradation in model accuracy. This is particularly severe for LLMs due to their low weight sparsity. To boost SAF tolerance of TCiM accelerators, we propose ReTern that is based on 1) fault-aware sign transformations (FASTs) and 2) TCiM bitcell reprogramming exploiting their natural redundancy. The key idea is to use FAST to minimize computation errors due to SAFs in +1/&#8722;1 weights, while the natural bitcell redundancy is exploited to target SAFs in 0 weights (zero-fix). Our experiments on BitNet b1.58 700M and 3B ternary LLMs show that our technique furnishes significant fault tolerance, notably ~35% reduction in perplexity on the Wikitext dataset in the presence of faults. These benefits come at the cost of &lt;3%, &lt;7%, and &lt;1% energy, latency, and area overheads, respectively.</description></item><item><title>FPGA-Oriented Design and Efficient Implementation of a Geometrically Tunable Multiscroll Conservative Chaotic System Without Equilibrium Points</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11071935</link><description>Although multiscroll conservative chaotic systems exhibit rich dynamical characteristics and hold great potential for secure communications, existing designs generally suffer from limited controllability and low hardware implementation efficiency. To address these challenges, this article proposes a novel 4-D multiscroll conservative chaotic system based on a nonlinear feedback structure constructed using the floor function. This original approach simplifies the system&#8217;s logical structure, facilitating efficient hardware modeling while enabling flexible control over the number, amplitude, and spatial distribution of scrolls in 3-D space. The system&#8217;s high complexity and coexisting behaviors are validated through dynamical analyses, including equilibrium point analysis, Poincar&#233; sections, and Lyapunov exponents (LEs). To achieve efficient deployment of the chaotic system on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platforms, this article first simplifies the hardware implementation logic of the feedback structure through the design of an algorithmic model based on bitwise operations. Subsequently, precise control of the system&#8217;s module signals is achieved through a finite state machine (FSM) design. The results of the resource comparison analysis indicate that the proposed model achieves a high throughput of 10.08 Gbps while consuming only 1051 look-up tables (LUTs). The lower energy efficiency is 0.0264 mW/Mbps. Hardware-software co-simulation and oscilloscope visual output confirm the numerical precision and hardware feasibility of the proposed system. Finally, this system is integrated with the ZUC stream cipher to construct a novel encryption core, enabling asynchronous ciphertext transmission as well as encryption and decryption functions, thereby demonstrating its potential for secure hardware applications.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Memory BIST With an Optimized RTL-BIST IP Core: A Low-Power, High-Fault-Coverage Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11053774</link><description>The increasing density of static random access memory (SRAM) in modern system-on-chip (SoC) architectures has intensified the need for efficient built-in self-test (BIST) solutions to ensure fault detection and repair.

Experimental results on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementations demonstrate that the March mSR+ algorithm achieves an 88.89% fault coverage while reducing power consumption compared with conventional March-based testing methods. These findings validate the effectiveness of the RTL-BIST framework in improving memory reliability for artificial intelligence (AI), high-performance computing (HPC), and safety-critical applications.</description></item><item><title>BTI Aging Analysis and Mitigation for Differential Input In-Memory Computing SRAMs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11081941</link><description>SRAM-based in-memory computing (IMC) is a promising approach to overcome the bottleneck of traditional Von Neumann architectures that suffer from data transfer delay and energy inefficiency. Aging phenomena and process variations are a serious reliability and lifetime concern that may impact SRAM-based IMC array architectures, similar to conventional SRAM arrays. Bias temperature instability (BTI) is a dominant aging mechanism that degrades transistor performance and negatively affects the analog nature of the IMC computations. In this work, we present a simulation framework for the joined analysis of aging and process variation influence on IMC reliable operation. We perform, through SPICE simulations, an extensive BTI aging analysis on differential input SRAM-based IMC array architectures under different operating conditions and considering process variations. The simulation results show a substantial impact of aging on their reliability. Furthermore, we present an aging mitigation technique to maintain reliability and extend the lifetime of these circuits. Aging mitigation is achieved by periodically reconfiguring the active current paths in the IMC cells, with negligible cost on throughput and power consumption. The simulation results show that up to 68% of the IMC circuits can lose accuracy after three operating years, depending on the operating conditions. The aging mitigation technique effectively reduces the percentage of circuits that lose accuracy by up to 72% and decreases their degradation rate, essentially extending by more than  $9.3\times $  their reliable lifetime.</description></item><item><title>A High-Performance Low-Power Double-Node Upset Resilient Latch for Harsh Radiation Environments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11089984</link><description>With the advancement of semiconductor technology, circuits have become increasingly susceptible to errors induced by radiation. Traditional approaches to enhancing the resilience of circuits against single-node upsets (SNUs) are insufficient to meet the robustness standards of modern designs. This article proposes a high-performance, low-power latch, named high-performance low-power double-node upset resilient latch (HLDRL), which is designed to exhibit exceptional resilience against double-node upsets (DNUs). Its design has six intricately interconnected C-elements (CEs) and two three-input CEs, for error interception, ensuring robust performance even in the case of DNUs. The Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) tool is used to validate the effectiveness of the HLDRL. Besides, comprehensive simulations are conducted utilizing the advanced SMIC 55-nm process technology. These simulation results show that our proposed HLDRL latch can autonomously recover from any DNU and thereby ensure the integrity of the system. Moreover, compared with existing DNU-resilient latches, the proposed HLDRL latch exhibits substantial improvements in terms of multiple metrics. On average, the proposed latch achieves an impressive 29.39% dynamic power saving, a remarkable 40.04% increase in speed, a notable 4.81% reduction in area, and a substantial 53.96% decrease in the power-delay&#8211;area product (PDAP). In the post-layout simulation, the proposed latch achieves a 30.39% dynamic power saving, a 36.47% increase in speed, and an impressive 52.38% decrease in PDAP.

The BFE employs an active phase shifter (PS), a variable-gain amplifier (VGA), and a two-stage power amplifier (PA) using stacked field-effect transistors (FETs) and neutralization. Across 39&#8211;44 GHz, the BFE achieves more than 25 dB gain, 17 dBm output 1-dB compression point, and 19.5 dBm saturated output power, with a peak power-added efficiency (PAE) of 24.9% at 39.5 GHz.

To resolve the issue of the signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) deterioration caused by the local oscillator (LO) leakage (LOL) in the integrated FE, we quantitatively investigated the effect of the LOL on SNDR by means of link budget calculation and derived the necessary power/phase imbalances in differential architectures to sufficiently reject the LOL. To achieve a sufficiently high LOL rejection, we propose the use of a 300-GHz band LO power amplifier (PA) with a high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR). The target value of the LO PA&#8217;s CMRR (&gt;15 dB) is also derived by the analysis to clarify the relationship between the power/phase imbalances and the CMRR. The unit amplifier in the LO PA achieves the simulated CMRR of more than 15 dB over the full range of the WR3.4 band (220&#8211;330 GHz) thanks to utilizing a common-mode rejection circuit (CMRC) based on passive components. By using the integrated circuit of LO PA and a mixer, we experimentally confirmed that the LOL of the TX is less than &#8722;33 dBm with the LO frequency range of 224&#8211;330 GHz and LO power of 0 dBm. The fabricated 300-GHz band TX and RX achieve a high conversion gain (CG) of above 5 dB over wide bandwidths of 35 and 56 GHz, respectively. We successfully demonstrated 16QAM 160-Gb/s over-the-air (OTA) data transmission using the fabricated FE with the link distance of 43 m.

The VGA cell is realized by a folded Gilbert-cell and it achieves a 2.4 GHz gain-independent bandwidth (BW). The exponential generator is realized by a parasitic bipolar transistor and it achieves a dB-linear gain control range of 59.7 dB with a gain error lower than 0.39 dB. A self-compensated control voltage generator is proposed to optimize the dB-linear gain response PVT robustness. The nonidealities that deteriorate the PVT robustness are analyzed and optimized. A self-adaptive current and voltage bias is proposed to alleviate the gain drift caused by the channel length modulation effect. Under PVT variations, the gain drift of the VGA is lower than 5.12 dB and its gain slope drift is lower than 3.99%. Based on the reconfigurability of the VGA&#8217;s dB-linear gain response, an automatic calibration flow is proposed to eliminate the gain response deviations between chips.

Power sensors are needed on phased arrays to detect if any output power degradation occurs. Of these events, we will mainly focus on antenna voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR)-related power degradation, as these events occur on a much shorter timescale compared with long-term effects such as device aging. VSWR-resilient power sensors are required to support these VSWR scenarios. They need to maintain high sensing accuracy and dynamic range (DR) even under unknown complex load impedances in a compact form factor.

Compared with the traditional resistive feedback (RF) and source-follower feedback wideband LNAs, the proposed LNA blocks the noise current from the feedback resistor with a simple additional  $g_{m}$ -cell, thus alleviating the  $S_{11}$ -NF design tradeoff in the traditional structures.

The CFB loop consists of a left-half-plane (LHP) and right-half-plane (RHP) zero together with an OOB complex pole pair so as to transition in-band (IB) positive feedback into stronger OOB negative feedback, resulting in a steep closed-loop (CL) filtering slope of &#8722;15 dB/octave. Using a normalized BB model, the CFB loop is implemented on the system level while a dual-path approach is introduced to map the system to the schematic level. A prototype of the MF-RX is realized in 22-nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) technology and achieves an adjacent-channel third-order intercept point (IIP3) of over 18 dBm across the wide 1.2&#8211;7.2-GHz local oscillator (LO) range as a direct result of the improved selectivity. The design achieves a channel bandwidth (BW) of 40 MHz, while the total radio frequency (RF)-to-BB gain is 32 dB. The  $2\times $  passive voltage gain of the capacitive stacking MF-RX enables a static power consumption of 9.7 mW at a minimum double sideband (DSB) noise figure (NF) varying from 5.1 to 9.0 dB across the LO range.</description></item><item><title>Drift-Compensated Magnetic Biosensors Using Concurrent Dual-Frequency Oscillators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909523</link><description>Magnetic biosensors that utilize magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as labels for biodetection assays have gained prominence in recent years due to their potential for use in rapid, accessible, and low-cost diagnostics devices. Resonance-shift-based magnetic biosensors are particularly suited for such applications, as they are readily implemented in standard CMOS processes, do not require external biasing or magnetic fields, and often do not require complex preparation chemistry. However, LC oscillator-based sensing cells suffer from drift induced by temperature fluctuations and other slow-varying noise sources, significantly degrading the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and impairing the achievable limit of detection. In this work, we propose a drift compensation approach utilizing a dual-frequency oscillator, operating concurrently at two widely spaced frequencies that track each other. The oscillator is designed such that the magnetic susceptibility of MNPs is large at the lower frequency but small and negative at the higher frequency. Thus, drift causes the oscillation frequencies to shift together, which can be canceled out, whereas the desired magnetic signal is encoded in the frequency difference. This enables simultaneous sensing and drift compensation, unlike previous approaches that utilize frequency switching. A proof-of-concept  $2 \times 2$  array spectrometer integrated circuit (IC) is presented, which achieves sub-ppm sensitivity and can be completely powered and controlled from a laptop Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface. Each sensing cell consumes as little as 3.1 mW and is tunable over a wide frequency range of 1.2&#8211;1.65 GHz/2.9&#8211;4 GHz. A single-step, wash-free immunoassay to detect streptavidin is performed, highlighting the viability of the magnetic spectrometer IC for in vitro diagnostic bioassays.</description></item><item><title>A 49.8-mm&#178; IR-UWB Transmitter With Co-Designed Power Amplifier and Antenna for Neural Implants With Extended Transmission Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856900</link><description>This work presents an implantable impulse-radio ultrawideband transmitter (IR-UWB TX) optimized for high-density neural recording. To address the tradeoffs between data rate, transmission range, implant size, and power consumption, we propose a novel co-designed power amplifier (PA) and an antenna interface. This approach eliminates the need for a bulky and lossy matching network (MN), thereby simplifying implementation and enhancing the energy efficiency of the TX. Moreover, unlike other implantable TXs that utilize conventional free-space communication antennas, our TX features an antenna specifically optimized in size and structure for neural implants. A compact and power-efficient ring oscillator (RO)-based wide-band phase-locked loop (PLL) is proposed to generate an RF carrier within the 3&#8211;6-GHz UWB band. Additionally, we introduce a 4-bit asymmetric pulse shaping technique that reduces intersymbol interference (ISI), enhancing data transmission rates. The proposed TX was fabricated in a 65-nm TSMC process. The wireless module, including a custom-designed printed antenna, has a compact form factor of only 49.8 mm2.

Additionally, a resonant feedback compensation equalization (RFCE) technique is presented to mitigate high-frequency gain roll-off, enhance gain flatness, and further expand the operation bandwidth. The principles of gain, bandwidth, and noise improvement are analyzed theoretically. To validate the proposed techniques, an LNA is designed and fabricated utilizing the IHP SG13G2 0.13- $\mu $  m silicon-germanium (SiGe) technology, featuring peak  $f_{T}/f_{\text {MAX}}$  of 350/450 GHz.

Like a rake receiver, the proposed analog correlator shifts a code instead of a UWB signal with FIR taps to relax the design complexity of an equalizer in the analog correlation. As a result, the power consumption for each FIR tap is reduced by more than ten times. A least-square-error-based FIR algorithm is proposed for the multipath mitigation of a burst position modulation (BPM) signal. To validate the proposed FIR-embedded QHC method, an 8-GHz 1T2R transceiver is implemented in 65-nm CMOS. The transceiver supports synchronization, BPM at 0.98/7.8 Mbaud/s, and precise localization.

On the receiver (RX) side, we discovered the data-flipping problem using the conventional full-bridge rectifier (FBR), which is ascribed to the interference from its distorted input voltage ( ${V} {_{\text {AC}}}$ ). This problem is solved by the proposed interference-free rectifier (IFR) featuring its low-distortion staircase  ${V} {_{\text {ac}}}$ . To further alleviate the crosstalk between power and data transfer, a tapped coil three-capacitor (TL3C) topology on the TX side together with a resonant topology on the RX side was proposed. The IFR IC was fabricated by a 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS process, with which a 6.78-MHz WPDT system was implemented. Experimental results showed that compared with the conventional FBR, the interference voltage ratio (IVR) in the proposed IFR was reduced from &#8722;17 to &#8722;45.2 dB. At a distance of 6 mm, our system supported simultaneous 54.4-mW load power ( ${P} {_{\text {Load}}}$ ) and 4.0-Mb/s forward data rate (DR) with 48.6% end-to-end efficiency ( $\eta _{\text {E2E}}$ ).

To support the power-intensive optical stimulation in NeuroFlare, the ASIC employs a novel linear-charging switched-capacitor stimulation (LC-SCS) structure. The LC-SCS, operating under only a 1.2-V supply voltage, can illuminate the LED with a driving voltage three times the supply voltage and large current pulses of up to 12 mA while maintaining a high charging efficiency of 86.4%. In addition, LC -SCS requires only one off-chip capacitor, greatly facilitating device miniaturization. To accurately record neural signals in the presence of stimulation artifacts, the ASIC employs a delta-sigma modulator ( $\Delta \Sigma $ M)-based recording front end with a wide dynamic range (DR) to directly digitize the neural signals.

To achieve broadband simultaneous noise and impedance matching, a triple-feedback technique combined with a strategically designed inter-stage matching network (ISMN), is analyzed and developed. The dual-mode switchable functionality, offering wideband flat gain performance, is enabled through a switch-based tunable capacitor configuration within the ISMN with adjustable load impedance. Additionally, a current-reuse amplification topology is employed to enhance both gain and linearity while reducing power consumption. Fabricated using 250nm GaAs pHEMT technology, the proposed switchable LNA achieves gain of 21.7-24.2/18.7-21.7dB, noise figure (NF) of 0.4-0.96/0.65-1.1dB, output 1-dB compression point of 15.7-19.7/14.2-19.4dBm, and output third-order intercept point of 25.6-35.1/25.4-34dBm in Mode 1 (0.6-3.5GHz) and Mode 2 (0.6-5.5GHz), respectively.

However, the mechanism faces challenges such as low arithmetic intensity, leading to frequent data movement, and long sequence lengths, which introduce a large amount of redundant information. To mitigate both data movement and computational overhead in attention mechanisms, we propose a hybrid CAM-SRAM processing-in-memory architecture.

Furthermore, an approximate booth encoding is employed in our MAC unit to reduce the number of partial products and maintain the consistency of their signs. This eliminates the need for negation operations, simplifying the logic design. Experimental results show that, in different configurations, our feature-level sparsification scheme achieves over 80% sparsity with an acceptable accuracy drop. With sparsity up to 80%, our design achieves a performance of 0.252-1.26 TOPS and a power efficiency of 4.71-21.72 TOPS/W, operating at 1000 MHz on the TSMC 40nm process.</description></item><item><title>Bifurcation Analysis of Slow-Scale Oscillation in SIDO Boost PFC Converter Using Time-Frequency Characteristic Representation Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11099099</link><description>Besides line frequency excitation, strong nonlinear crossing effect amongst three input/output ports exists in single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) boost power factor correction (PFC) converters, which leads to the occurrence of complex behaviors including slow-scale oscillation. In this brief, a nonlinear averaged model is derived to describe the nonlinear time-periodic coupling (NTPC) effect of the SIDO PFC converter, and importantly time-frequency characteristic representation method is proposed to obtain the analytical expression of periodic equilibrium solutions. Furthermore, two types of slow-scale oscillations are identified with the help of the loci movement of Floquet multipliers. It is shown that period-doubling bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation are responsible for type I alternating peak oscillation and type II discontinuous trajectory oscillation, respectively. Especially, Hopf bifurcation results in one incommensurable frequency component with respect to the line frequency, which explains the reason why the system enters one quasi-periodic orbit. Finally, these experimental results are given to verify the theoretical analysis.

In addition, it achieves an inference speed of 224.8 frames per second (FPS) on the RTX 3090 with  $512\times 1024$  resolution. To achieve a power-efficient solution meant for battery-operated devices, we also deploy our model on Xilinx&#8217;s ZCU102 development board (Zync UltraScale+ MPSoC). Despite achieving an impressive performance, its power consumption is only 950 mW; significantly lower than GPU-based inferences.

However, when the deep neural network (DNN) accelerator performs inference tasks at the edge end, the sensitive data of DNN will generate leakage through side-channel information. The adversary can recover the model structure and weight parameters of DNN by using the side-channel information, which seriously affects the protection of necessary intellectual property (IP) of DNN, so the hardware security of the DNN accelerator is critical. In the current research of Side-channel attack (SCA) for matrix multiplication units, such as systolic arrays, the linear multiplication operation leads to a more extensive weights search space for the SCA, and extracting all the weight parameters requires higher attack conditions. This article proposes a new power SCA method, which includes a Collision-Correlation Power Analysis (Collision-CPA) and Correlation-based Weight Search Algorithm (C-WSA) to address the problem. The Collision-CPA reduces the attack conditions for the SCA by building multiple Hamming Distance (HD)-based power leakage models for the systolic array. Meanwhile, the C-WSA dramatically reduces the weights search space. In addition, the concept of a Side-channel star map (SCSM) is proposed for the first time in this article, and the adversary can quickly and accurately locate the correct weight information in the SCSM. Through experiments, we recover all the weight parameters of a  $3\times 3$  systolic array based on 100000 power traces, in which the weight search space is reduced by up to 97.7%. For the DNN accelerator at the edge, especially the systolic array structure, our proposed novel SCA aligns more with practical attack scenarios, with lower attack conditions, and higher attack efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Model Switching in RRAM-Based DNN Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10922769</link><description>Resistive random access memory (RRAM) has emerged as a promising technology for deep neural network (DNN) accelerators, but programming every weight in a DNN onto RRAM cells for inference can be both time-consuming and energy-intensive, especially when switching between different DNN models. This article introduces a hardware-aware multimodel merging (HA3M) framework designed to minimize the need for reprogramming by maximizing weight reuse, while taking into account the hardware constraints of the accelerator. The framework includes three key approaches: 1) crossbar (XB)-aware model mapping (XAMM); 2) block-based layer matching (BLM); and 3) multimodel retraining (MMR). XAMM reduces the XB usage of the preprogrammed model on RRAM XBs while preserving the model&#8217;s structure. BLM reuses preprogrammed weights in a block-based manner, ensuring the inference process remains unchanged. MMR then equalizes the block-based matched weights across multiple models. Experimental results show that the proposed framework significantly reduces programming cycles in multi-DNN switching scenarios while maintaining or even enhancing accuracy, and eliminating the need for reprogramming.</description></item><item><title>CMD: A Cache-Assisted GPU Memory Deduplication Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10930882</link><description>Massive off-chip accesses in graphics processing units (GPUs) are the main performance bottleneck. We find that many writes are duplicate, and the duplication can be inter-dup and intra-dup. While inter-dup means different memory blocks are identical, and intra-dup means all the 4B elements in a line are the same. In this work, we propose a cache-assisted GPU memory deduplication architecture named cache-assisted GPU memory deduplicated (CMD) to reduce the off-chip accesses via utilizing the data duplication in GPU applications. CMD includes three key design contributions which aim to reduce the three kinds of accesses: 1) a novel GPU memory deduplication architecture that removes the intra-dup and inter-dup lines. We design several techniques to manage duplicate blocks, reducing massive off-chip writes; 2) we propose a cache-assisted read scheme to reduce the reads to duplicate data. When an L2 cache miss wants to read the duplicate block, if the reference block has been fetched to L2 and it is clean, we can copy it to the L2 missed block without accessing off-chip DRAM. As for the reads to intra-dup data, CMD uses the on-chip metadata cache to get the data; and 3) when a cache line is evicted, the clean sectors in the line are invalidated while the dirty sectors are written back. However, most read-only victims are rereferenced from DRAM more than twice. Therefore, we add a full-associate FIFO to accommodate the read-only (it is also clean) victims to reduce the rereference counts. Experiments show that CMD can decrease the off-chip accesses by 31.01%, reduce the energy by 32.78% and improve performance by 42.53%. Besides, CMD can improve the performance of memory-intensive workloads by 57.56%.</description></item><item><title>GPOS: A General and Precise Offloading Strategy for High Generality of DNN Acceleration by OCP and NDP Co-Optimizing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10939009</link><description>The arithmetic intensity (ArI) of different DNNs can be opposite. This challenges the generality of single acceleration architectures, including both dedicated on-chip processing (OCP) and near-data processing (NDP). Neither architecture can simultaneously achieve optimal energy efficiency and performance for operators with opposite ArI. It is relatively straightforward to think of combining the respective advantages of OCP and NDP. However, few publications have addressed their real-time co-optimization, primarily due to the lack of a quantifiable offloading method. Here, we propose GPOS, a general and precise offloading strategy that supports high generality of DNN acceleration. GPOS comprehensively considers the complex interactions between OCP and NDP, including hardware configurations, dataflow (DF), DNN model, and interdie data movements (DMs). Three quantifiable indicators&#8212;ArI, execution cost (Ex-cost), and DM-cost&#8212;are employed to precisely evaluate the impacts of these interactions on energy and latency. GPOS adopts a four-step flow with progressive refinement: each of the first three steps focuses on a single indicator at the operator level, while the final step performs context-based calibration to address operator interdependencies and avoid offsetting NDP benefits. Narrowing down offloading candidates in step 1 and step 3 significantly accelerates real-time quantitative analysis. Optimized mapping techniques and NDP-input stationary DF are proposed to reduce Ex-cost and extend operator types supported by NDP. Next, for the first time, sparsity&#8212;one of the most popular methods for energy optimization that can alter data reuse or ArI&#8212;is quantitatively investigated for its impacts on offloading using GPOS. Our evaluations include representative DNNs, including GPT-2, Bert, RNN, CNN, and MLP. GPOS achieves the minimum energy and latency for each benchmark, with geometric mean speedups of 49.0% and 94.1%, and geometric mean energy savings of 45.8% and 89.2% over All-OCP and All-NDP, respectively. GPOS also reduces offloading analysis latency by a geometric mean of 92.7% compared to the evaluation that traverses each operator and its relative combinations. On average, sparsity further improves performance and energy efficiency by increasing the number of operators offloaded to NDP. However, for DNNs where all operators exhibit either very high or very low ArI, the number of offloaded operators remains unchanged, even after sparsity is applied.</description></item><item><title>Efficient and Scalable Post-Layout Optimization for Field-Coupled Nanotechnologies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916761</link><description>As conventional computing technologies approach their physical limits, the quest for increased computational power intensifies, heightening interest in post-CMOS technologies. Among these, Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN), which operates through the repulsion of physical fields at the nanoscale, emerges as a promising alternative. However, realizing specific functionalities within this technology necessitates the development of dedicated FCN physical design methods. Although various methods have been proposed, their reliance on heuristic approaches often results in suboptimal quality, highlighting a significant opportunity for enhancement. In the realm of conventional CMOS design, post-layout optimization techniques are employed to capitalize on this potential, yet such methods for FCN are either not scalable or lack efficiency. This work bridges this gap by introducing the first scalable and efficient post-layout optimization algorithm for FCN. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficiency of this approach: when applied to layouts obtained by a state-of-the-art heuristic method, the proposed post-layout optimization achieves area reductions of up to  $ {\mathrm {73.75~\%}}~({\mathrm {45.58~\%}}$  on average). This significant improvement underscores the transformative potential of post-layout optimization in FCN. Moreover, unlike existing algorithms, the method exhibits scalability even in optimizing layouts with over 20 million tiles. Implementations of the proposed methods are publicly available as part of the Munich Nanotech Toolkit (MNT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/fiction.</description></item><item><title>PTPS: Precision-Aware Task Partitioning and Scheduling for SpMV on CPU-FPGA Heterogeneous Platforms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10937993</link><description>The CPU-FPGA heterogeneous computing architecture is extensively employed in the embedded domain due to its low cost and power efficiency, with numerous sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) acceleration efforts already targeting this architecture. However, existing work rarely includes collaborative SpMV computations between CPU and FPGA, which limits the exploration of hybrid architectures that could potentially offer enhanced performance and flexibility. This article introduces an FPGA architecture design that supports multiprecision SpMV computations, including FP16, FP32, and FP64. Building on this, PTPS, a precision-aware SpMV task partitioning and dynamic scheduling algorithm tailored for the CPU-FPGA heterogeneous architecture, is proposed. The core idea of PTPS is lossless partitioning of sparse matrices across multiple precisions, prioritizing low-precision SpMV computations on the FPGA and high-precision computations on the CPU. PTPS not only leverages the strengths of CPU and FPGA for collaborative SpMV computations but also reduces data transmission overhead between them, thereby improving the overall computational efficiency. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach offers an average speedup of  $1.57\times $  over the CPU-only approach and  $2.58\times $  over the FPGA-only approach.</description></item><item><title>GRACE: An End-to-End Graph Processing Accelerator on FPGA With Graph Reordering Engine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10939011</link><description>Graphs play an important role in various applications. With the rapid expansion of vertices in real life, existing large-scale graph processing frameworks on CPUs and GPUs encounter challenges in optimizing cache usage due to irregular memory access patterns. To address this, graph reordering has been proposed to improve the locality of the graph, but introduces significant overhead without delivering substantial end-to-end performance improvement. While there have been many FPGA-based accelerators for graph processing, achieving high throughput often requires complex graph prepossessing on CPUs. Therefore, implementing an efficient end-to-end graph processing system remains challenging. This article introduces GRACE, an end-to-end FPGA-based graph processing accelerator with a graph reordering engine and a pull-based vertex-centric programming model (PL-VCPM) Engine. First, GRACE employs a customized high-degree vertex cache (HDC) to improve memory access efficiency. Second, GRACE offloads the graph preprocessing to FPGA. We customize an efficient graph reordering engine to complete preprocessing. Third, GRACE adopts a graph pruning strategy to remove the activation and computation redundancy in graph processing. Finally, GRACE introduces a graph conflict board (GCB) to resolve data conflicts and a multiport cache to enhance parallel efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that GRACE achieves  $7.1 \times $  end-to-end performance speedup over CPU and  $1.8 \times $  over GPU, as well as  $27.3 \times $  and  $8.7 \times $  energy efficiency over CPU and GPU. Moreover, GRACE delivers up to  $34.9 \times $  performance speedup compared to the state-of-the-art FPGA accelerator.</description></item><item><title>Evaluation of FONOS FDSOI FET for Synapse-Inspired Artificial Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10930942</link><description>In this article, a well calibrated FDSOI ferroelectric (Fe)-FET/FeFET is gate-stacked with a charge trap nitride (CTN) for investigating memory and synaptic applications. The CTN is sandwiched between Fe and silicon channel of FeFET to obtain ferroelectric/oxide/nitride/oxide/semiconductor (FONOS) FET for improved memory and synaptic applications. This approach of using both Fe and CTN layers to improve memory and synaptic applications is labeled as hybrid approach. Since, both the Fe or CTN as a standalone gate-stack dielectric can give threshold-voltage ( $V_{T}$ ) shift leading to hysteresis transfer characteristics with a program (PGM)/erase (ERS) schemes that predict a memory window (MW). The FeFET uses spontaneous polarization ( $P_{S}$ ) to obtain memory operation which offer low power and area. The CTN uses highly mature and reliable charge-trapping-memory (CTM)-based e ${}^{-} $ /h+ trapping  $\Leftrightarrow $  de-trapping mechanism with PGM/ERS scheme to obtain MW that has high- $V_{T}$  (HVT) and low- $V_{T}$  (LVT) transfer characteristics. Hence, a combination of these leading to a FONOS FET architecture, which is investigated for improved memory properties like MW and retention followed by examining on synaptic attributes for realistic device training accuracy toward artificial neural networks (ANNs). From the investigations: 1) FONOS memory device has predicted improvement in MW with 2.65 V for 8-nm thick CTN layer and retention of Fe-electric field ( $E_{\mathrm { Fe}}$ ) and charge density for  $\approx 11$  years and 2) synaptic device has shown an accuracy of 93% for MNIST digit dataset in ANNs. These predictions from the FONOS FET aimed at providing hybrid solutions to next-generation devices with extended applications in memory and neuromorphic applications with reliable device operation.</description></item><item><title>Ultralow Power Zirconium Electrolyte-Based Synaptic Device for Neuromorphic Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10926909</link><description>This work presents a novel electrolyte-based artificial synaptic device mimicking mammalian synaptic behavior because of an Electric Double Layer (EDL) for various neural-based applications. ZrO2, as an Electrolyte, with Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide (IGZO) as a channel material, has been utilised for Synaptic Device (ZEISD). A novel electrolyte, ZrO2, with intercalation property, produces synaptic behaviors similar to biological neurons. The device shows sound synaptic functions, such as excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC), and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF). With different spike amplitudes and frequencies, the device transitions from short-term potentiation (STP) to long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression characteristics, an essential neural behavior. FERMI, PRINT, and SRH modelling have been utilised to obtain neural behaviors. A higher On/Off ratio  $\approx ~10^{5}$  has been obtained in line with designed and calibrated synaptic devices with ultralow power consumption as low as 0.162 pJ. Our findings hold significant implications for advancing the field of artificial neuromorphic devices, allowing for the creation of adaptable, dynamic functionalities.</description></item><item><title>An Optimization-Aware Prerouting Timing Prediction Framework Based on Multimodal Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909720</link><description>Accurate and efficient prerouting timing estimation is particularly crucial during placement to alleviate time-consuming design iterations. Machine-learning (ML)-based methods have been introduced recently to predict the post-routing timing results at placement stage, but most of them neglect the impact of timing optimization during physical design, suffering from accuracy loss due to inconsistent circuit netlist. In this work, an optimization-aware prerouting timing prediction framework based on multimodal learning is proposed to calibrate the timing changes between placement and routing stages, where the local netlist and layout information are extracted by graph neural network (GNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN), respectively, while the global information along the path is further extracted by Transformer network. Based on the predicted post-routing timing results by the proposed framework, timing optimization guidance is generated to enhance traditional design flow with better physical implementation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that for the OpenCores benchmark circuits under TSMC 22nm process, the proposed framework achieves significant correlation and accuracy improvement with an average of 0.9219 in terms of R2 score and 2.12% of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as well as an average runtime acceleration of  $645\times $  compared with traditional design flow on testing designs. With the timing optimization guidance, significant worst negative slack (WNS) and total negative slack (TNS) improvement are achieved compared with traditional flow after placement and routing, respectively, without noticeable area, power, wire length, and the number of design rule check (DRC) violations increase.</description></item><item><title>SaaP: Rearchitect SoC-as-a-Processor to Orchestrate Hardware Heterogeneity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10935670</link><description>Due to the end of Moore&#8217;s Law and Dennard Scaling, Domain-Specific Accelerators (DSAs) have come to a Cambrian explosion. Especially when advancing into the intelligent era, more and more DSAs are integrated into System-on-Chips (SoCs) as intellectual property (IP) blocks to provide high performance and efficiency. Currently, IPs usually expose IP-dependent hardware interfaces, requiring SoCs to manage them as isolated devices with software running on the host CPU. However, such software-managed heterogeneity in CPU-centric SoCs leads to low IP utilization. This inefficiency arises from the dependence on software optimization, coupled with the control and data exchange overheads. To improve IP utilization of heterogeneous SoCs, in this article, we rearchitect the SoC as a processor (i.e., SaaP) to orchestrate hardware heterogeneity. SaaP features an orchestration pipeline where DSAs are integrated as execution units and managed directly by the hardware pipeline to conceal the hardware heterogeneity from software. Moreover, SaaP redesigns the register file and data paths to implement an IP-level data-forwarding mechanism, avoiding the costly control and data exchange in the CPU-centric execution model. Block data dependence among different DSAs is carefully resolved to exploit mixed-level parallelism and inter-IP data exchange. SaaP abstracts tasks as mixed-scale instructions, where each instruction can be mapped to different IPs. Experimental results show that compared against Xavier on six fully software-optimized benchmarks from different domains, SaaP-rearchitected Xavier achieves a  $2.08{\times }$  speedup, with an 8.21% area reduction and only 2.98% increase in power consumption.</description></item><item><title>On Optimizing Inter- and Intra-Chiplet Interconnection Topologies for Robust Multi-Chiplet Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10922749</link><description>Inter- and intra-chiplet interconnection networks play a vital role in the operation of many core systems made of multiple chiplets. However, these networks are susceptible to faults caused by manufacturing defects and attacks resulting from the malicious insertion of hardware Trojans and backdoors. Unlike conventional fault-tolerant or countermeasure methods, this article focuses on optimizing network robustness to withstand both faults and attacks, while considering the constraints of chiplet area and power budget. To achieve this, this article first defines network robustness as a quantifiable measure based on various network parameters, after which an optimization problem is formulated to optimize the robustness of the network topology. To efficiently solve this problem, a reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of generating inter- and intra-chiplet interconnection networks that are significantly more robust than existing topology generation methods. Specifically, the proposed method improves robustness over ButterDonut and Kite, respectively, by an average of 10.88% and 14.06% under random faults and by 9.37% and 7.81% under targeted attacks. These experimental results confirm that the proposed method is capable of generating robust inter- and intra-chiplet interconnection networks that can withstand both faults and attacks. By optimizing the network topology&#8217;s robustness, it provides a valuable contribution to the design and security of chiplet-based core systems.</description></item><item><title>Intermittent-Friendly Neural Architecture Search: Demystifying Accuracy and Overhead Tradeoffs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10944793</link><description>The fusion of tiny energy harvesting devices with deep neural networks (DNN) optimized for intermittent execution is vital for sustainable intelligent applications at the edge. However, current intermittent-aware neural architecture search (NAS) frameworks overlook the inherent intermittency management overhead (IMO) of DNNs, leading to under-performance upon deployment. Moreover, we observe that straightforward IMO minimization within NAS may degrade solution accuracy. This work explores the relationship between DNN architectural characteristics, IMO, and accuracy, uncovering the varying sensitivity toward IMO across different DNN characteristics. Inspired by our insights, we present two guidelines for leveraging IMO sensitivity in NAS. First, the overall architecture search space can be reduced to exclude parameters with low IMO sensitivity, and second, network blocks with high IMO sensitivity can be primarily focused during the search, facilitating the discovery of highly accurate networks with low IMO. We incorporate these guidelines into TiNAS, which integrates cutting-edge tiny NAS and intermittent-aware NAS frameworks. Evaluations are conducted across various datasets and latency requirements, as well as deployment experiments on a Texas Instruments device under different intermittent power profiles. Compared to two variants, one minimizing IMO and the other disregarding IMO, TiNAS, respectively, achieves up to 38% higher accuracy and 33% lower IMO, with greater improvements for larger datasets. Its deployed solutions also achieve up to a 1.33 times inference speedup, especially under fluctuating power conditions.</description></item><item><title>Formal Synthesis of Neural Barrier Certificates for Dynamical Systems via DC Programming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10943236</link><description>Barrier certificate generation is an ingenious and powerful approach for safety verification of cyber-physical systems. This article suggests a new learning and verification framework that helps to achieve the balance between the representation ability and the verification efficiency for neural barrier certificates. In the learning phase, it learns candidate barrier certificates represented as convex difference neural networks (CDiNNs). Since CDiNNs can be rewritten as difference of convex (DC) functions that can express any twice differentiable function, thus have outstanding representation ability and flexibility. In the verification phase, it employs an efficient approach for formally verifying the validity of the neural candidates via DC programming. Due to the convexity-based structure, CDiNNs can significantly facilitate the verification process. We conduct an experimental evaluation over a set of benchmarks, which validates that our method is much more efficient and effective than the state-of-the-art approaches.</description></item><item><title>Fully Programmatic Automated Design Procedure of Comparators for Analog-to-Digital Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10963892</link><description>This article proposes a system-aware, fully programmatic and automated, process agnostic design methodology, which utilizes system-level simulations with the layout parasitics of the circuit under optimization included.

The procedure is shown to effectively converge toward performance achieved with ideal comparator in post-layout across two different semiconductor processes. While the methodology was demonstrated for design of comparators, the proposed system-aware methodology is generally applicable to any analog circuit, drastically reducing design time while providing a silicon ready circuit implementation purpose designed to the higher level system without human-in-the-loop.</description></item><item><title>Make It Easy!
