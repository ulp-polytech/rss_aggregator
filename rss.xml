The main idea could be used to integrate any magnetic device, such as decoupled inductors, decoupled transformers, or decoupled inductor with transformer, in the same core. In this article, a case of two decoupled inductors integrated in the same core using two orthogonal windings is presented. The proposed magnetic device features two inductive coils, wound on a single magnetic core, arranged perpendicularly in three-dimensional space. This specific configuration ensures nearly zero magnetic coupling between the coils, effectively transforming the integrated magnetic device into two independent inductors with higher power density. The three-plate structure distributes the magnetic flux in a more uniform manner, mitigating magnetic concentration within the structure. The uniform distribution of magnetic flux enables the device to handle stronger H-fields before reaching saturation, thus increasing the power density of the device. The design holds promise for various dc&#8211;dc converter applications, potentially leading to cost and size reduction with higher power density. The article provides a comprehensive analysis of the magnetic performance of the proposed magnetic device through detailed finite element method simulations. The magnetic performance of the proposed device is compared with that of the recently proposed two-plate, quadratic-legs structure. The adoption of the three-plate design led to a 25% reduction in the magnetic flux density, for the same load conditions, enabling the device to handle 60% higher current than the quadratic-legs structure. A prototype, tested using a 250 W 2-phase interleaved boost converter and compared with discrete core inductors, revealed that the proposed device achieved a 50% reduction in the volume of the magnetic component of the system without compromising system efficiency, which remained consistent at 94% for both discrete core inductors and the proposed magnetic device.</description></item><item><title>A Radially Symmetrical Star-Shaped Core Multiwinding Transformer With Controllable Magnetic Integration for N-Port MAB Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10806644</link><description>Dual active bridge (DAB) and multiple active bridge (MAB) converters are widely used in the on-board propulsion systems of transportation electrification applications. The tendency of power density improvement leads to the magnetic integration investigation of the isolated HF links, that is to integrate the series inductors and a high-frequency transformer (HFT) into a single magnetic component by increasing the leakage inductance of the HFT. This article proposed a novel radially symmetrical star-shaped core high-frequency multiwinding transformer (HFMT) with split windings for the generalized N-port MAB converters. The proposed HFMT can adjust the leakage inductances within a wide range by the magnetic integration control parameters, which includes lengths of extension legs, side, and central pillars, horizontal air gaps, turns of windings, and winding distribution ratio. Port consistency is promised by the insertion of vertical flux barriers. Based on the magnetic circuit analysis, accuracy of leakage inductance estimation can be guaranteed. A cross-shaped-core HFMT is designed for a quadruple active bridge to validate the effectiveness of the proposed RSSC HFMT as a case study. 3-D finite element analysis simulation and prototype experiments were conducted to validate the theoretical analyses.</description></item><item><title>High-Frequency Transformer Loss Measurement and Modeling: A DC Loss Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10806751</link><description>High-frequency transformer is a key component in power electronic converters, yet accurately modeling their losses remains a big challenge. This article introduces a novel direct current (dc) loss measurement method to model losses in two-winding high-frequency transformers. By conducting multiple tests, the dc loss method can measure the equivalent resistances of a transformer at different operating points. Instead of using conventional circuit analysis models, the proposed method utilizes an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the losses in the excitation inverter. The ANN overcomes the difficulties caused by nonlinear parasitic parameters in inverters for loss prediction, thereby significantly enhancing measurement accuracy. A testing platform based on the proposed method was constructed, and the loss models of several high-frequency transformers were measured. The measurement results were compared with those obtained using the finite element method (FEM) and impedance analyzer, demonstrating the high accuracy of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Minimum Torque Ripple Control for Brushless Doubly-Fed Induction Generator-DC System Under Power Winding Open-Phase Fault</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777292</link><description>In order to cope with the severe torque ripple caused by the open-phase fault of the power winding (PW) in the brushless doubly-fed induction generator-dc (BDFIG-DC) system, a novel minimum torque ripple control method is proposed in this article. The proposed method does not rely on additional external hardware devices and can minimize the torque ripple in the faulty system, thereby reducing damage to the machine bearings. First, this article analyzes the harmonic components of the torque caused by PW open-phase fault in detail and derives the simplified torque expression. Second, by regulating the 3rd and 5th harmonic currents of PW, a minimum torque ripple control method is proposed. To obtain the real-time reference values of PW 3rd and 5th harmonic currents, Newton's gradient descent method is adopted. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is proven by comprehensive experimental results on a 5-kVA BDFIG-DC system platform.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Torque Ripple Suppression Method With High Power Factor for Electrolytic Capacitor-Less IPMSM Drive Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787135</link><description>The torque ripple is an important concern in the electrolytic capacitor-less interior permanent magnet synchronous motor (IPMSM) drive system. In this article, a novel method based on d-axis harmonic current injection is proposed to reduce the torque ripple while maintaining a high power factor. The main fluctuating components in the torque with respect to the d-q axis current are derived, and possible configurations of the d-axis current reference are analyzed to obtain an optimal solution to reduce the torque fluctuations. To further improve the power factor, an active damping method based on virtual damping resistor is used to suppress harmonics in the grid current, and a feedforward power compensation link is added to improve the grid current quality. The torque ripple component can be reduced and the requirements of EN61000-3-2 can be satisfied by applying the proposed method. Experimental results on an IPMSM drive platform with a small film capacitor verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Robust Adjustable Speed Drive to Operate in Polluted Grid Conditions With Improved Line Current Harmonics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10806790</link><description>With an increase in the abnormalities in the supply voltage, it is required that the Adjustable Speed Drive (ASD) connected to the grid be immune to those disturbances. Based on the field Power Quality (PQ) data study, distortion in the supply voltage is found to be the dominant disturbance followed by unbalance. It is found that these disturbances mainly affect the lifetime of dc bus capacitor and in critical cases, it may lead to a failure. In order to save the ASD from such grid disturbances, a compensation module is introduced in this article. While reducing the stress on the capacitor, this module also mitigates the harmonics in the source current of ASD. The proposed module can be a retrofit to the existing commercial ASD and can be used where the supply voltage quality is poor. The proposed topology is analyzed by simulations and validated by the test setup created in the lab.</description></item><item><title>Open-Circuit Fault Diagnosis for Active Rectifiers in Doubly Salient Electromagnetic Generator Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10807085</link><description>The performance of the double salient electromagnetic generator (DSEG) system is improved by replacing diode rectifiers with active rectifiers. However, the fault rate of power switches is higher than that of diodes. Thus, diagnosing faults in active rectifiers is necessary. This article proposes a fault diagnosis method for power switch open-circuit faults of active rectifiers in DSEG systems. First, power switch open-circuit faults are divided into two types. Fault type I: the insulate-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) is an open-circuit, and its freewheeling diode (FWD) can work normally. Fault type II: the IGBT and its FWD are open-circuits. The causes and effects of the two fault types are analyzed. Second, the IGBT open-circuit is common to both types. The rapid diagnosis of the IGBT open-circuit is achieved by utilizing the changes in the dc-link current before and after faults as fault features. The overlap areas of fault features are analyzed to avoid missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis. Moreover, if the IGBT open-circuit fault is diagnosed in a certain sector, then the two fault types are distinguished by the phase current features of the two other sectors. Finally, experiments are conducted on a 12/8-pole DSEG experimental platform to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Stability Analysis and Harmonic Filtering Enhancement of Single-Voltage-Loop PI- Controlled Grid-Forming Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10795211</link><description>Grid-forming converters (GFMCs) remain on a strong growth trajectory in the field of power electronics due to ac voltage formation and frequency regulation capabilities. Compared with multiloop control strategies, single-loop voltage control benefits from the simplicity of sensors and controllers, rapid dynamics, and no voltage/current control interaction. However, as revealed by this article, LCL-filtered GFMCs with single-voltage-loop proportional&#8211;integral (PI) controllers feature a high resonance frequency for stable operation in grid-tied and islanded scenarios, which deteriorates switching harmonic filtering due to the small filter size. As such, we propose a switching harmonic filtering enhancement strategy for GFMCs by the use of the LLCL filter, whose LC trap forms a serial resonance at the switching frequency and, thus, allows improved harmonic attenuation. In this way, we achieve strong switching harmonic filtering of LLCL-filtered single-voltage-loop PI-controlled GFMCs. Furthermore, this article derives relevant stability regions. Finally, simulation and experimental results verify the theoretical analysis and switching harmonic attenuation capability.</description></item><item><title>Impacts of the Bottom Copper Layer of Direct-Bond Copper Substrates on the Partial Discharge Performance in Power Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10794661</link><description>This article studies the impacts of the bottom copper layer of direct-bond copper (DBC) substrates on the partial discharge (PD) performance of the power modules. Finite element simulation models of DBC samples with various layouts are developed, and their electric field distributions are compared and analyzed. The results show that by floating the bottom copper layer, applying half of the high voltage, or partially or completely removing the bottom copper layer, the maximum electric field concentrated at the triple point of DBC substrates can be significantly reduced. Multiple DBC samples are manufactured, and their PD performance is experimentally tested. The partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) can be increased by more than 79% by completely removing the bottom copper layer. Experimental results show good agreement with the simulation analysis and verify the findings. A mimic power module employing the concept of completely removing the bottom-layer copper is made and tested for PD performance under IEC 60270 standard. Compared to the conventional power module structure, the PDIV of the new power module structure can be increased by 63%. The findings in this article can provide guidance and potential strategies to reduce the electric field in encapsulated DBC substrates, which will contribute to optimizing the insulation design of future medium voltage power modules.</description></item><item><title>Switch Fault Diagnosis for Switched Reluctance Motors Based on Current Double-Measurement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10801196</link><description>Fault diagnosis of power switches is essential for enhancing the reliability of switched reluctance motor (SRM) systems.

In addition, the application analysis is provided in detail for SRMs with different control strategies and chopping modes. Furthermore, the phase current detection can be effectively performed under switch fault conditions. Finally, experiments using an 8/6 four-phase SRM are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis method.</description></item><item><title>Research on Remaining Lifetime Evaluation for Traction System IGBT Devices of Electric Locomotives With Different Service Mileage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10803108</link><description>In electric locomotive system, the function of traction converter depends heavily on insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) module, and IGBT module is prone to failure. Traditionally, ensuring safety has involved expensive and wasteful &#8220;mileage maintenance,&#8221; which includes regular replacement of IGBT modules. Therefore, assessing the residual reliability of these modules, taking into account their different service miles, is meaningful. First, the dynamic and static characteristics of IGBT modules under different service mileage are compared and analyzed. Second, the power cycling test for different mileage IGBT modules is carried out to analyze the differences between them. Then, the microscopic analysis of the failure module further confirms the results of the failure analysis. Finally, the fatigue accumulation state of IGBT modules can be deduced from the power cycling test data to predict the remaining life of IGBT modules. This study reveals that the health state is unevaluable using dynamic or static characteristic parameters. It is proved that the power cycling tested results are significantly different for different service-mileage devices. Finally, a remaining lifetime predicted method of power devices is proposed, where the health status is inverted by the power cycling tests.</description></item><item><title>An Online Monitoring Method of Bond Wire Lift-off Unevenness in Multichip SiC MOSFET Power Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10805559</link><description>Monitoring bond wire lift-off unevenness is the basis for high-reliability operation of multichip silicon carbide (SiC) metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (mosfet) power modules. The traditional methods of monitoring bond wire lift-off can only monitor the overall number of the bond wire lift-off for one module. In this article, a new method is proposed to monitor the number of the bond wire lift-off for each parallel chip, which breaks through the limitations of traditional methods. A Kelvin source electrode is added in each parallel chip of the module. Under a constant current source, the voltage ratio related to the bond wires is used to monitor the number of bond wire lift-off for the chip. The validity of the proposed method is verified online by experiments based on a buck converter, a half-bridge inverter, and a double pulse test. Experiments show that the number of bond wire lift-off of each chip can be effectively monitored by the voltage ratio. The normal operation of the converter is not disturbed by the proposed method. The proposed method is not affected by the junction temperature and the gate-oxide degradation of SiC mosfet.</description></item><item><title>Robust Power Self-Balancing Control for Wind-Hydrogen Direct-Connected System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787432</link><description>Harnessing wind power through hydrogen offers a promising renewable energy solution. Yet the intermittency of wind poses challenges in coordinating wind turbines and electrolyzers. To solve this problem, the wind-hydrogen power coordination control based on the dc bus voltage signal can be adopted. However, because of the mismatch between wind and hydrogen, the dc bus voltage exceeds the normal range frequently, which threatens the safe and stable operation of the system. Focusing on this challenge, this article first establishes a dynamic model of the dc bus voltage for the wind-hydrogen direct-connected system. Then, the fluctuation mechanism is analyzed through detailed mathematical derivations. On this basis, a robust power self-balancing control is proposed using an adaptive arc-tangent function to maintain the dc bus voltage within a proper range while ensuring rapid power matching between the wind turbine and electrolyzer under fluctuating conditions. Finally, the findings are validated through the corresponding wind-hydrogen direct-connected experiment platform.</description></item><item><title>Automated Power Converter Topology Derivation Methodology Based on Exhaustive Graph Search</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804588</link><description>Due to increasing electrification, there is a need for new power converter topologies. Traditionally, deriving these topologies require skill and experience. Recently, graph theory has been employed in an effort to automate the formation process of nonisolated converters with dc ports. This article proposes an extension of this methodology, introducing ac ports and isolated topologies. This is accomplished by taking into account the directional properties of the power electronic components. As a result, a distinction can be made between unidirectional/bidirectional and dc/ac ports. Besides, other asymmetrical characteristics, such as the need for bidirectional switches, can be verified. Furthermore, the methodology provides a solution for the inclusion of components with more than two terminals. This allows for the introduction of isolation transformers. After the derivation of candidate topologies, the voltage relations and current flows are automatically checked, verifying the operational boundary conditions. The article demonstrates the proposed methodology in a PV-battery system use-case. This showcases the resulting original circuits incorporating a dc input port, dc bidirectional port, and ac output port.</description></item><item><title>Autonomous Battery Equalization Module Using Capacitively Coupled Input-Parallel Output-Series Structure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10803961</link><description>An autonomous battery equalization module, which utilizes an energy circulation technique to equalize the voltage across individual battery cells in a series-connected batteries, is presented. Its structure consists of two power conversion stages. The first stage converts the battery string voltage into a high-frequency ac voltage to form a capacitively coupled ac link. The second one contains multiple diode-based rectifiers with their inputs connected to the ac link via coupling capacitors and their outputs connected in series to individual battery cells. Based on the property that the coupling capacitor voltage equals the battery cell voltage, and the rectifier input voltage are shared across the ac link, the magnitude of the current delivered by the second-stage converter is determined by the difference between the coupling capacitor voltage and the ac-link voltage. As the current taken from the first stage is common to all battery cells, charging or discharging of individual battery cells is autonomously adjusted by the output current of the second stage. Apart from equalizing the voltage of the battery cells within a module, the proposed architecture also allows multiple modules connected via the ac link. Individual battery cell can be charged by or discharged to the rest of battery cells in the same module or other modules. Two four-cell modules for equalizing eight 3.6 V, 18 650 batteries have been built and evaluated.</description></item><item><title>Collaborative Design of Multiloop Controllers for DFIG-Based Wind Turbines to Optimize Inertia Characteristics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804647</link><description>Controller parameter optimization-based inertia provision methods for wind turbines (WTs) have received much attention, due to their economy and convenience. However, the existing methods fail to consider the effect of multiple controllers on the magnitude-phase characteristics of inertia, which may cause a short support time of WT's inertia response and even deteriorate the system frequency dynamics. To cope with it, this article proposes a collaborative design of multiloop controllers for doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based WTs to optimize inertia characteristics. First, the magnitude-phase characteristics of WT's inertia and their effect on system frequency are analyzed. Then, based on the Sobol' sensitivity analysis method, the dominant influences affecting the magnitude and phase of WTs&#8217; inertia are revealed, respectively. On this basis, a collaborative design method of multiloop controllers is proposed from the perspective of the magnitude-phase characteristics optimization of WT's inertia, which can support system frequency effectively while satisfying constraints of stability as well as rotor kinetic energy. Finally, the analysis and the proposed design method are verified by hardware-in-loop experiments.</description></item><item><title>An Ultrawide Range Pulse Width Modulated LLC Converter With Voltage Multiplier Rectifiers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804659</link><description>This article presents a voltage multiplier rectifier-based LLC resonant converter that achieves an ultrawide range of the output voltage with pulse width modulation (PWM) of the auxiliary switches on the secondary side. Compared with the pulse frequency modulated LLC topologies, the proposed topology operates at a fixed frequency and features a bounded voltage gain range. Thus, the resonant tank design can be optimized at one frequency, and high efficiency can be realized throughout the output voltage range. Furthermore, the proposed topology greatly extends the maximum PWM normalized voltage gain range to 4.0 with two-mode operations. Meanwhile, zero-voltage switching is realized for all the switches, and a seamless mode transition is achieved by the proposed converter. At last, a time-domain-based analysis and optimization methodology are proposed. A 300 kHz, 1 kW, 400 V input/250&#8211;1000 V output prototype demonstrates high efficiency through the output range and achieves 97.69% peak efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Output Modular Wireless Power Transfer System With Constant-Current Characteristic</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10786202</link><description>In the medium- and high-capacity power applications, typically multiple switches connected in series and parallel are used in power electronic converters to handle high voltages and currents. Powering the driving circuits and auxiliary units with high insulation requirements is challenging. This article proposes a modular multioutput wireless power transfer system with constant-current (CC) output characteristics for auxiliary power supply. Compared with conventional solutions, there is no need for complex control circuits and much magnetic material. The dual-frequency topology with CC outputs is derived by applying the analytical method that used to obtain the dual-frequency topology with constant-voltage (CV) outputs. The conditions for the system to maintain zero phase angle at different frequencies are discussed. Lower output fluctuations than single-frequency multioutput systems and dual-frequency CV output systems are verified. A magnetic coupler with integrated compensation inductors is designed to eliminate the need for discrete inductors and improve the power density. An experimental prototype is built to verify the validity of the theory. The WPT system achieves an output current fluctuation of no more than 4.78%, a maximum system efficiency higher than 85%, and an output power of more than 10 W at a single port, which can well meet the requirements of auxiliary power supply.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Control Strategy of LCC&#8211;LCC Compensated Electric Vehicles Wireless Charging System With Wide ZVS Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10797685</link><description>In this article, a hybrid control strategy considering zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) of the inverter within a wide load range is proposed for LCC&#8211;LCC compensated electric vehicles wireless charging system. The modified asymmetric voltage cancellation and half-bridge (HB) control modes are combined to satisfy output requirements. Based on the hybrid control strategy, constant-current and constant-voltage outputs can be easily achieved by fixed-frequency phase shift without complex control and additional auxiliary circuits. A time-domain model considering harmonics and rectifier load is developed, based on which an optimal parameter design method is presented for the hybrid control strategy to achieve ZVS and minimize circulating reactive power. Finally, a 3.3 kW experimental prototype is built to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The results show that ZVS can be achieved over the range of 10&#8211;100% rated output power. Compared with the conventional hybrid control strategy that combines symmetric phase shift and HB control, the efficiency can be improved by 1.2&#8211;3.6% and the maximum efficiency is 94.1%.</description></item><item><title>Duty and Phase Control of a Self-Synchronized Class E Rectifier for High-Frequency Wireless Power Transfer System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10795204</link><description>This article proposes a high-frequency (HF) wireless power transfer (WPT) system using duty and phase control of a self-synchronized class E rectifier considering the nonlinear internal capacitance of field-effect transistors (FETs). In HF WPT systems ($&gt;$$ \text{13.56}\,\text{MHz}$), the self-synchronized class E rectifier provides a precise gate signal by compensating for the propagation delay. However, when controlling the output power of the HF WPT system, the nonlinear capacitance $C_{\text{oss}}$ of FETs distorts the shape of the drain-voltage waveform, which reduces the efficiency due to nonzero-voltage switching or partial diode operation. To mitigate this issue, we propose an $\alpha$ (=duty ratio) and $\beta$ (=phase delay) control method for a self-synchronized class E rectifier while considering the nonlinear $C_{\text{oss}}$ of FET. To achieve robust control and performance of the HF WPT system, we employed a regression method to estimate the value of $C_{\text{oss}}$ more accurately. Specifically, considering the impact of $C_{\text{oss}}$ on the performance of the HF WPT system, we selected two optimized control points $P_{\text{max}}$ and $P_{\text{min}}$ and developed a first&#8211;order polynomial equation representing the relationship between $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Following the determined $\alpha$$\beta$ relationship, the output power of the WPT was adjusted by hysteresis control while maintaining the highest efficiency. In the experimental validation, the proposed WPT system achieved a conversion efficiency of 82% to 76% in the 160&#8211;90 W output power range. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method was also verified in closed-loop control during dynamic operation from 160 to $100\,\mathrm{W}$, with a minimal ripple (1.7%) in the output power.</description></item><item><title>Front-End Parameter Identification Method Based on Adam-W Optimization Algorithm for Underwater Wireless Power Transfer System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10795256</link><description>Monitoring coupler parameters in underwater wireless power transfer (UWPT) systems is crucial for improving the system transmission characteristics. Due to the eddy current effect, the equivalent circuits of the magnetic coupler are more complex and contain more parameters than those in air-based circuits. Traditional parameter identification methods, which rely on solving circuit matrix equations, often struggle with the complex UWPT systems or require significant computational resources to solve high-order multivariate equations. This article proposes a coupler parameter identification method based on the adaptive moment estimation with a weighted adjustment (Adam-W) optimization algorithm to address the multiparameter identification problems in the UWPT system. This method transforms the problem of solving high-order matrix equations into an optimization problem to address multiparameter identification problem caused by seawater eddy effect, which is challenging for traditional methods. In addition, it facilitates online monitoring of the characteristic parameters of the system's coupler by detecting the system's front-end input current and voltage without wireless communication and additional sensor modules, and exhibits better reliability in underwater environments. The experimental results show that the proposed Adam-W algorithm achieves a high parameter identification accuracy within 1 s and 94 iterations with an average error of 2.78%. Comparably, an average error of 56.74% is achieved by gradient descent and 41.49% by adaptive moment estimation, and 37.42% by particle swarm optimization in 150 iterations. The proposed Adam-W algorithm achieves higher accuracy in parameter identification of the UWPT system within a shorter time and demonstrates better applicability in seawater environments.</description></item><item><title>A Multipolarity-Coupling Composite Design for Enhancing Lateral and Rotational Misalignment Tolerance of Long-Track DWPT Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10799203</link><description>Lateral misalignment accompanied with rotational angle is unavoidable in the long-track dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) system. This results in an undesirable degradation in transmission performance. To address this vexing misalignment issue, a receiver (Rx) side topology based on multipolarity-coupling composite design is proposed in this article. The designed Rx composite assembly, consisting of a circular coil and three rectangular solenoid coils, effectively catches both vertical and horizontal magnetic fields, complementing each other to suppress mutual inductance variation during misalignment. Only two design variables are included for parameter optimization process, which features simple design flow and convenient implementation without resorting to changing the existing ground assembly configuration. Efficiency stability enhancement is unveiled through power loss analyses combined with theoretical calculation. A scaled-down long-track DWPT system with nearly 320 W output power is built as an example to validate the proposed design. The experimental results show that the system dc&#8211;dc efficiency variations remain below 10% with a 40 mm lateral misalignment (53% of the transmitter track width) across a full deflection angle range of [&#8722;90&#176;, 90&#176;].</description></item><item><title>An Integrated Charger of Wireless Power Transfer, Onboard Charger, and Auxiliary Power Module for Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804007</link><description>The rapidly developing electric vehicles (EVs) calls for improvement in the charging system for the high-voltage (HV) and low-voltage (LV) batteries in EVs. In the conventional EV charger, wireless power transfer (WPT), onboard charger (OBC), and auxiliary power module (APM) are three separate structures. This article proposes an integrated charger for WPT, OBC, and APM by sharing power conversion stages with the advantages of cost effectiveness and high-power density. The transformer of OBC can be seen as two strongly coupled coils, and the secondary-side coil can be loosely coupled with the transmitting coil of the WPT system, serving as a receiving coil. A transformer can be employed on the receiving side to integrate the APM with WPT. In this way, the receiving coil, the compensation network, and the power electronics converter can be shared. The integrated structure can work in three modes. In the first mode (wireless charging mode) and the second mode (conductive charging mode), the utility delivers power to the HV and LV batteries simultaneously. In the third mode (HV-LV mode), the LV battery is charged by the HV battery through APM. An experimental prototype is implemented to validate the proposal.</description></item><item><title>An Optimization Approach for Efficiency and Interoperability Enhancement of WPT Systems for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804657</link><description>Wireless power transfer (WPT) systems for autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) have emerged as a significant application.

This control method can quickly respond to the change of the resonant frequency of the system. It could solve the problem of UWPT system mismatch caused by complex marine environment with the help of a digital phase-locked loop. The circuit structure is simplified without adding any additional components or changing the topology. In addition, the constant voltage level or the constant current level of the dc output of the UWPT system is realized by adjusting the phase shift angle. The control method can adjust the resonant frequency and the dc output voltage or current without requiring an external circuit. Finally, an experimental platform of 500 W UWPT system is built to verify the theory analysis and the design. The experimental results show that this control method could track the resonant frequency well when the resonant frequency of the UWPT system is offset. At the same time, it can effectively maintain a constant output voltage or current when the load impedance of the system changes.</description></item><item><title>UAV Fleet Charging on Telecom Towers With Differential Capacitive Wireless Power Transfer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10812032</link><description>This article introduces a capacitive differential wireless power transfer architecture to efficiently charge an array of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) on a telecom tower as a UAV airport.

To achieve optimal charging performance, several requirements must be met. First, it is necessary to simultaneously achieve constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) charging modes using the same compensation network, while maintaining zero-phase angle (ZPA) at the input impedance. Second, it is desirable for the charging modes to remain unaffected by the coupling coefficient (k). Third, a systematic and straightforward method is needed to design the compensation network topology and parameters. In this article, we propose a novel systematic compensation network design method that fulfills all three requirements for the first time. The method represents the magnetic coupling transformer and the compensation network as a series of cascaded T-type modules. By analyzing the requirements for achieving CC or CV modes with ZPA conditions in the basic T-type module and extending these requirements to multiple T-type modules, the parameters of the compensation network can be determined. This approach enables the identification of a series of compensation networks that simultaneously achieve CC and CV modes with ZPA characteristics, independent of the k. Additionally, we introduce a simplified compensation network, LLCC-S, which satisfies the aforementioned requirements with least compensation components. Numerical simulations and experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed compensation network. The results demonstrate the network's ability to achieve the desired CC and CV modes with ZPA features, irrespective of the k.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Phase AC Input Induction Heating System With Heat Distribution Control Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643990</link><description>This article proposes a new three-phase ac input induction heating (IH) system for plate heating. The proposed system consists of three sets of a direct ac&#8211;ac converter and a pancake-shaped work coil. Each phase uses the set of the converter and the coil. In the proposed system, the three work coils are arranged in a triangular shape with a certain distance to eliminate mutual induction between them. Therefore, each converter can operate independently. The proposed system uses this independence to realize a power factor correction (PFC) operation of ac-line currents. Also, the proposed system can control heat generation on a workpiece above a center of the three coils by using the independence. The proposed system with heat distribution control capability is theoretically considered, and it is also validated experimentally. As a result, the proposed system demonstrates both the PFC operation of the ac-line currents and heat distribution control at the rated power of 3 kW.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Model Predictive SHM Control for Zero CMV in Three-Phase Five-/Nine-Level Packed E-Cell Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10649585</link><description>This article proposes a hybrid model predictive selective harmonic mitigation (SHM) to design a multiobjective switching control where zero common mode voltage (CMV), harmonic distortion mitigation, capacitor voltage balancing, and switching voltage-level operation are aimed in three-phase packed E-cell (PEC) inverter. SHM is developed for low frequency five-/nine-level voltages to improve power quality and achieve zero CMV. Afterward, SHM is hybridized with model predictive control (MPC) to select switching states in an online procedure and then actively balance PEC capacitor voltages. Due to MPC-based implementation of SHM, the switching voltage-level is acquired where both five-/nine-level voltages can be generated in three-phase PEC inverter to demonstrate its capability in dealing with faulty switch conditions. Hybrid model predictive SHM switching control is proven through both hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) using OPAL-RT simulator and experimental implementation using DS1202 and the results illustrate that all targeted objectives are attained for low frequency five-/nine-level three-phase PEC inverter.</description></item><item><title>Characteristics Analysis of Resonant Topology in Three-Phase Wireless Power Transfer Systems Considering Star-Delta and Neutral Point Connections</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10646389</link><description>Three-phase wireless power transfer (WPT) systems have the advantages of higher power density and low power fluctuations. However, increasing the number of phases complicates the resonant topology structure of the system. Existing research lacks analysis of the unique electrical characteristics of three-phase resonant topologies, particularly regarding the star-delta and different connections of inductor and capacitor neutral points. This article derives the expressions for the resonant capacitance of first-order and second-order topologies under star-delta connections. After contrasting the voltage stresses on resonant components and system transmission characteristics under different star-delta connections, the suitable application scenarios for each connection method are provided. Utilizing the symmetrical component method, expressions for the voltage of inductor and capacitor neutral points under star connection are derived, and then the optimal neutral point connection topology for both balanced current control and independent current control scenarios is proposed. Finally, an experimental prototype is constructed to validate the theoretical analysis presented in this article.</description></item><item><title>Three-Dimensional Vector Multimapping-Based Power Split for Single-Stage Multiport Inverter-Fed Motor Drives</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666911</link><description>Single-stage multiport inverter (SSMI) is an attractive solution for hybrid electric vehicles. However, it is challenging to design the modulation scheme for the SSMI since flexible power split between sources on the dc side together with satisfactory stator current control on the ac side should be achieved simultaneously. To this end, a three-dimensional vector multimapping (3DVM)-based power split strategy is proposed in this article to realize flexible power split while guaranteeing the stator current regulation under unbalanced dc links. In the proposed 3DVM scheme, the asymmetrical 3-D vector space is divided into two symmetrical subspaces to simplify the modulation scheme design under unbalanced dc links, and the reference vector decomposed process provides an additional degree of freedom for power split by regulating the decomposed factors. Subsequently, a direct power control model with respect to decomposing factors is put forward to realize power split between dc-port sources without affecting the stator current control. Moreover, by mapping the decomposed reference vectors to the edges and planes of the subspaces, the switching actions are reduced, which increases the power conversion efficiency. Experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Communication-Free Fast Constant Current and Voltage Control Method for Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10644045</link><description>In this article, a communication-free constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) Li-ion charging control method for dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) systems is proposed. The key challenge of traditional control schemes is the coupled mutual inductance and battery equivalent resistance, which leads them to solely allow either dynamic coupling condition or varying load resistance. In the proposed control method, by adopting an inductive secondary resonator, the mutual inductance and load resistance are decoupled in CV mode. The output current and voltage are controlled by estimating the bias between the real-time state and the reference steady state. The CC and CV modes are switched automatically without bidirectional communication. Hence, the proposed control method is featured with less time delay, fast dynamic performance, and low implementation cost. Both the simulation and experimental results prove that the proposed control scheme has high control precision (less than 4% steady-state error) and short settling time (less than 40 ms) in the CC/CV charging mode.</description></item><item><title>Exploring a Controlled Permeability Bypass-Based and Simple Contact Mechanism for MPD System With Single Input and Multiple Outputs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654650</link><description>This article investigates a novel magnetic power distribution (MPD) system that utilizes conductive magnetic power transfer and wireless power transfer methods. The proposed system employs U- and I-type magnetic cores to form a single-input and multiple-output system, where the U-type magnetic core serves as the transmitter or receiver, and the I-type magnetic core acts as the flux conduction path. By inserting low relative permeability (LRP) I cores between two high relative permeability (HRP) I cores and placing additional U magnetic cores in parallel with the LRP I cores, multiple outputs with different power ratings can therefore be realized. Analysis of operating frequency and the effect of LRP I core on power distribution is presented in detail through theory and simulation. Finally, a prototype with a wide range output power of 200W-550W is tested to evaluate the performance of the proposed MPD system with one- and two-receiver modes, in which the system with a single receiver achieves 329W with a system efficiency of 82.77%, while the system with two receivers obtained a total output power of 422.73W with 86.98% system efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Accurate Design of Very-High-Frequency Resonant Converter Based on Gradient Descent and Considering Multiple Harmonics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10649017</link><description>Due to the inherent strong coupling and nonlinearity in typical very-high-frequency (VHF, 30&#8211;300&#160;MHz) resonant converters, conventional design methods face challenges in considering multiple harmonics and identifying their complex coupling relationships, which limits the design accuracy of resonant parameters. In order to solve this issue, this article presents a new design method, which involves considering multiple harmonics for the separate design of the inverter and rectifier stages and identify their coupling relationships by using the gradient descent algorithm. The simulation result shows that the output power, particularly the soft-switching feature are very consistent with the design requirement. Compared to the conventional design methods, the proposed one in theoretical design has higher accuracy and reduces dependence on simulation tools, which helps to guide the further consideration of parasitic parameters in practical design and develop it into a computer program for easier application. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method are experimentally verified by a 30&#160;MHz prototype with a rated input power of 20W.</description></item><item><title>A Solenoid Magnetic Coupler and Its Control Method for Omnidirectional Wireless Charging of UAVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660634</link><description>This article proposes a solenoid magnetic coupler for omnidirectional wireless charging of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which has a compact structure, high rotational and lateral misalignment tolerance, and low-leakage magnetic flux interference. The transmitter consists of two groups of orthogonal and mutually decoupled solenoid coils, which mainly generate horizontal (x-, y-direction) magnetic flux, and almost no vertical (z-direction) magnetic flux is generated. Hence, it can significantly reduce the leakage magnetic flux interference on UAV equipment. The solenoid receiver is attached to the UAV landing gear, which is lightweight and does not require additional installation space. To achieve maximum efficiency tracking under arbitrary angles and positions, a targeted omnidirectional wireless power transfer (WPT) method consisting of mutual inductance identification, phase difference configuration, and duty cycle optimization is presented. The experimental results show that the system output power and efficiency are maintained at 130&#8211;176 W and 84.1%&#8211;86.1% under arbitrary rotational and lateral misalignments.</description></item><item><title>Asymmetrical Low-Voltage Ride-Through Control Strategy Based-on PBC With Virtual Voltage Compensation for Voltage-Controlled VSG</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10644048</link><description>Grid-forming (GFM) inverters have the advantages of voltage and frequency support in weak grid. However, unlike grid-following inverters, GFM inverters present a more challenging picture during asymmetrical voltage sag. The voltage-controlled virtual synchronous generator (VVSG) is the typical control method of GFM inverter. However, the problem of large inrush, slow response speed, and negative-sequence current control need to be carefully considered. In the existing low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) control strategies, these issues cannot be decently coped with while maintaining the ability to support the grid. In this situation, system instability and deterioration of power quality may occur. To overcome these limitations, an asymmetrical LVRT control strategy is proposed. First, the positive and negative-sequence models are established and the asymmetrical instantaneous currents are calculated. Based on this, the influences of the VVSG control method on the instantaneous negative-sequence currents are analyzed, which reveals the role of negative-sequence virtual voltage amplitude, grid phase angle, and response speed. Then, the double closed-loop control based on VVSG control method is further improved. The negative-sequence virtual voltage is compensated in the outer-loop to achieve control of negative-sequence current and inrush current. A novel passivity-based control (PBC) strategy is extended into innerloop which has fast transient response and strong robustness. Furthermore, through the transient power angle stability analysis, the improvement of the transient margin is proved. Finally, simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>DC-Link Zero Power Fluctuation of Grid-Tied Inverters: Implementation With Two-Phase Virtual Phase-Current Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654638</link><description>Unbalanced grid conditions caused by asymmetrical faults or voltage distortions extremely deteriorate the grid reliability, resulting in power fluctuation of three-phase grid-tied inverters at dc link. A virtual phase-current regulation (VPCR) method is introduced in previous research to solve the power quality problem depending on controller feedback current regulation. With VPCR, the dc-link power fluctuation can be suppressed, whereas cannot be completely removed. To fulfill this gap, a novel two-phase VPCR method is proposed in this article, in which an additional virtual phase current gain in the non-fault phase has been introduced into the current loop. Since more VPCR parameter adjustments can be realized, a complete smoothing of dc-link power fluctuation is achieved by the proposed method. Accordingly, based on the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, a parameter tuning method of two-phase VPCR is designed to achieve a fast and convenient parameter optimization. The proposed two-phase VPCR method as an emerging tool of dc-link power quality governance is verified by simulation and experiment.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Multilayer Master-Slave Control Strategy for Power Management in Autonomous DC Microgrid Clusters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665922</link><description>DC microgrid clusters are effective solutions for integrating multiple autonomous subgrids at the same and different voltage levels. In such a system, global power management is an essential concern, but it is always degraded by system structures and line impedances of distributed generation units (DGUs). To solve this problem, a decentralized multilayer master-slave control strategy is proposed. In the selected master DGU, an ac signal is injected into the output voltage, and power information is carried by its frequency and consequently broadcast to other slave DGUs via power lines. In slave DGUs, the output power is regulated to track the demodulated power information, which generates voltage offset to realize power sharing in a single subgrid. The interlinking converter is exploited for interconnection between two subgrids, it is also used to transmit the broadcast power information from one subgrid to another one, which therefore ensures global power management throughout the dc microgrid cluster. All the control algorithms rely on only local measurement, and information transmission is implemented via existing power lines, no dedicated communication network is required. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated by hardware-in-loop and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>A Sigmoid-Weighted-Consensus for Balancing Multiple Battery Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665931</link><description>In this article, a weighted-consensus strategy for state-of-charge (SoC) balancing, voltage regulation and accurate current sharing in a dc microgrid (MG) composed of battery energy storage systems (BESSs) is presented. The&#160;consensus strategy is applied in association with a S-shape function known as sigmoid function, a common activation function in neural networks. By a neighbor-to-neighbor communication, each BESS exchange its SoC information to achieve faster SoC balancing and uses only its capacity for accurate current sharing. The&#160;sigmoid functions ensure continuity and differentiability of the system around the charging/discharging of the BESSs and guarantee the SoC balancing even if the graph becomes disconnected by communication failures or if the consensus is switched-off. As each BESS uses its own information in the weighted-consensus, the resilience against attacks and communication time-delays is increased. When all SoCs are within operational limits, the strategy avoids circulating currents in the MG by forcing all BESSs either charge or discharge simultaneously. However, if the SoC limits are violated, simultaneous charge and discharge among BESSs in a low rate is allowed to satisfy the limits. Experimental tests show the feasibility of the proposed approach and its faster SoC balancing in relation to advanced methods in the literature.</description></item><item><title>A Three Coordinated Power Channels LLC Converter With Ultrawide Voltage Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10662954</link><description>To achieve ultrawide output voltage range, this paper proposes a novel isolated LLC resonant converter with three coordinated power channels. The proposed converter features three working conditions and encompasses five operation patterns, allowing for the adjustment of quality factor for a wider gain range. With more power channels, the converter can reduce the stress of the resonant tank and switches to further improve the higher power level and achieve the soft switching. To ensure smooth gain transition and a wider gain range, the turns ratio of the transformer is designed by considering three different conditions. Finally, a 1 kW prototype was built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed topology. The results confirm the eight times output voltage range of the converter and a peak efficiency of 96%.</description></item><item><title>An Electromagnetically Integrated LCL-EMI Filter for V2G Power Converters: Topology, Analysis, and Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660635</link><description>High-frequency grid-tied inverters in vehicle-to-grid (V2G) systems often produce lots of high-frequency harmonics and electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise. Therefore, a filtering module, which consists of a harmonic filter and an additional EMI choke, is typically required to effectively restrain the aforementioned noises, but this passive module will inevitably raise size and cost of the converter, which goes against high-power density demand of electric vehicles (EVs). To address this issue without impairing the filter&#8217;s performance, this article proposes a decoupled electromagnetically integrated structure of a symmetrical LCL-EMI filter for grid-tied converters in V2G applications. EE-shape magnetic core and flexible multilayer foil (FMLF) technique are employed in the integration design, the FMLF windings for achieving a symmetrical LCL filter are wound on side limbs of the EE core, and the EMI choke windings are arranged on the central limb. The used proper terminal configuration of the windings can almost realize function-decoupling between the LCL unit and EMI choke. Moreover, magnetic decoupling can be achieved between converter- and grid-side inductors of the LCL unit through air-gap design in the EE core&#8217;s side limbs, which can preserve the LCL unit&#8217;s satisfactory harmonic attenuation performance. Performance analysis and design principles of the integrated module are introduced, and the experimental results from a 1-kW SiC-MOSFET high-frequency grid-tied converter confirm the feasibility and validity of the approach.</description></item><item><title>Reinforcement Learning to Stabilize Singularly Perturbed DC-Side Dynamics of Grid-Connected Voltage-Source Converters in Modern AC&#8211;DC Grids Using Singular Perturbation Theory and Adaptive Dynamic Programming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666842</link><description>The stability and performance of ac&#8211;dc systems in grid modernization heavily rely on the rectification mode of grid-connected voltage-source converters (GC-VSCs). Being considered as the heart of the system, its impact is significant. The current-controlled GC-VSC based on the cascade control using a pulsewidth modulation approach is commonly deployed in the smart grid paradigm. This article discusses how the dynamics induced by that type of GC-VSC control structure can be regarded as singularly perturbed systems in modern ac&#8211;dc grids. As a result, it proposes a novel optimal control strategy for the voltage control problem with uncertain dynamics using reinforcement learning (RL) via the adaptive (or approximate) dynamic programming method and the singular perturbation theory (SPT). First, by means of SPT, the original optimal control problem is decomposed into two optimal problems with respect to an unknown slow time-scale subsystem and a known fast time-scale subsystem. Second, for the slow subsystem with unmeasurable states, an output-feedback-based off-policy RL algorithm with a guaranteed convergence is given in order to learn the optimal controller in terms of measurement data. Third, a composite controller is established in terms of the obtained fast&#8211;slow controllers; its optimality and closed-loop stability are rigorously proved. Unlike the direct full-order design, not only does the proposed decomposition composite design framework bypass the numerical stiffness, but it also alleviates the high dimensionality in the control synthesis. Comparative experiments using testing based on power hardware-in-the-loop simulations and rapid control prototyping methodology reveal the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Observer-Based Online Parameter Identification of Series&#8211;Series Tuned Inductive Power Transfer System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654636</link><description>Recently, many studies have investigated controller design methodologies for inductive power transfer (IPT) systems, relying on preidentified circuit parameters for determining controller gains. However, controllers based on such parameters are vulnerable to identification errors. Additionally, IPT systems exhibit unpredictable mutual inductances depending on coil alignments, necessitating a parameter identification process to enhance system reliability. This article proposes observer-based, online parameter identification methods for series&#8211;series tuned IPT (SS-IPT) systems. Self-inductances of transmitter and receiver coils, load resistance, and mutual inductance are identified using disturbance observers and rotating reference frame circuit models of the SS-IPT system. The proposed self-inductance and load resistance observers feature identification bandwidths of 500 Hz, whereas the mutual inductance observer has an estimation bandwidth of 50 Hz, concluding the parameter identification processes within 10 ms. Moreover, the proposed observers demonstrate robustness to initial parameter errors. Given their reliance on measured states and observers, the proposed parameter identification methods are suitable for dynamic IPT systems. The effectiveness of these observer-based parameter identification methods is assessed through a comparison of theoretical and simulated frequency responses, as well as simulated and experimental time-domain responses.</description></item><item><title>Discontinuous PWM Operation of a Single-Phase PV Generator With Low-Voltage Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660638</link><description>Using energy storage (ES) in grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) generators is an efficient solution to deliver regulated power to the grid despite fluctuations in solar irradiance. The article analyses a single-phase grid-connected PV generators with ES, where the ES has a low voltage, namely without too many series-connected storing cells. The PV generator consists of three subsystems connected by a common dc-link capacitor: a PV unit, an ES unit, and an inverter. Furthermore, in the proposed solution, the inverter does not switch for a significant portion of the grid period, resulting in lower switching losses. The single-phase inverter discontinuous operation implies the need of an appropriate control strategy in the boost dc&#8211;dc converter of the ES unit. The proposed control employs an augmented state model that accounts for resonant variables. The proposed PV solution with low-voltage ES, including its control, is validated in a 350-VA experimental prototype to verify the novel approach.</description></item><item><title>Resilient Distributed Secondary Control for Bidirectional Interlinking Converters in Hybrid AC/DC Microgrids Against FDI Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654574</link><description>In this article, we investigate the resilient distributed secondary control problems of the ac bus frequency and ac main bus voltage regulation, along with active/reactive power sharing among bidirectional interlinking converters (BICs) under false data injection (FDI) attacks in hybrid ac/dc microgrids (MGs). To solve these problems, the distributed iterative observers are first proposed, which incorporate the dynamic characteristics of the previous observation into the present FDI attack observation to achieve the accurate observation of the ac bus frequency and ac main bus voltage, as well as active power, reactive power, and injected FDI attacks of each BIC. Afterward, based on the average FDI attack estimation, a resilient distributed secondary controller is introduced to eliminate the impact of FDI attacks on BICs, achieving accurate recovery of ac bus frequency and ac main bus voltage, as well as the sharing of active/reactive power among BICs under FDI attacks. Compared with existing resilient control strategies in hybrid ac/dc MGs under FDI attacks, the proposed resilient control strategy can enable hybrid ac/dc MGs to exhibit better transient performance during FDI attack injection and disappearance. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed observers and controller is confirmed through a real-time controller-hardware-in-the-loop experiment in OPAL-RT.</description></item><item><title>Optimized Ripple Prelearning Process for Phase-Shift Control of Interleaved Multiphase DC&#8211;DC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669117</link><description>Minimizing ripples and harmonics is an important criterion in multiphase dc&#8211;dc converters. In&#160;case of physical parameters degradation, nonidentical phases, or fault occurrence, the symmetrical interleaved mode ceases to be the optimum mode, and a supervising system is required. This article proposes a novel method for optimizing the current ripples and harmonics in multiphase dc&#8211;dc converters based on asymmetrical phase shifting using only the sensed variables by the control loops. The&#160;proposed method uses a developed online phases current shape-factors (PCSFs) calculation algorithm based on the currents derivative with an artificial neural network (ANN), offline trained, using an enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique on a high-fidelity model of the converter. The&#160;goal is to meet the desired current requirements by adapting phases shifting dynamically during the converter's operation at each period. Moreover, in the case of an open circuit fault (OCF), the proposed method can successfully adapt the phase shifting between the remaining healthy phases, reducing the current ripples caused by the fault. The&#160;proposed technique is validated experimentally using a three-phase interleaved boost converter, illustrating the current improvement in various scenarios such as OCFs and nonidentical parameters, proving an effective phase-shifting adaptation against uncertainties and variations in the parameters.</description></item><item><title>A New Perspective for Frequency and DC Voltage Stability Comprehension in Two-Terminal VSC-HVDC Systems With Virtual Inertia Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665988</link><description>This letter proposes a new perspective for the interactive stability mechanism between frequency and dc voltage in a voltage-source converter-based high-voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) system with virtual inertia control. The system model is first established, providing a new physical insight into dc voltage and frequency stability. It is found that the frequency instability may be caused by the control loop of virtual inertia or the oscillation transfer of dc voltage. Similarly, the dc voltage oscillation can be induced by the inappropriate design of dc voltage control loop or the transfer of the frequency. The complex oscillation coupling mechanism as well as the oscillation transfer essence is clarified physically. Finally, the correctness as well as the feasibility of the theoretical analysis is verified by the hardware-in-loop experiment.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Wind Power Forecasting Based on the Strategy of &#8220;Dynamic Matching and Online Modeling&#8221;</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620613</link><description>Ultra-short-term wind power forecasting plays a vital role in real-time scheduling, frequency regulation, and intraday market transactions. Due to the complexity of weather systems, unit aging, wind farm control strategies, etc., the temporal dependency relationship in wind power series changes from time to time (known as concept drift), which leads to the low forecasting accuracy of the commonly used offline modeling methods. Online modeling can effectively deal with concept drift by utilizing the latest information in the flow data and capturing the latest concepts during the modeling process. However, the existing online modeling methods cannot meet the timeliness requirements of the power grid for ultra-short-term wind power forecasting. Therefore, a strategy of &#8220;dynamic matching and online modeling&#8221; for ultra-short-term wind power forecasting is proposed in this paper. Training samples are dynamically selected according to the characteristic similarity of amplitude and fluctuation, aiming to improve the representativeness of samples and reduce the training time simultaneously. In addition to historical power, Numerical Weather Prediction wind speed is also introduced in the process of &#8220;dynamic matching&#8221; to improve the forecasting accuracy. Operation data from three wind farms in China is used to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The results show that the forecasting accuracy can be improved by 1.18%&#8211;4.32% for 4 hours in advance.</description></item><item><title>Resilience-Oriented Two-Stage Restoration Considering Coordinated Maintenance and Reconfiguration in Integrated Power Distribution and Heating Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620409</link><description>The inherent linkage between a power distribution system (PDS) and a district heating system (DHS) necessitates coordinated load restoration after natural disasters. To guarantee optimal load restoration during a recovery process, a coordinated dispatch strategy of the maintenance crew for the PDS/DHS considering the optimal reconfiguration of their respective networks is proposed in this paper. The proposed solution focuses on the intricate mutual interaction of the DHS and PDS and coordinates the fault isolation and service restoration stages. The proposed optimization is modeled as a mixed-integer second-order cone problem (MISOCP), which contains numerous integer variables. To lessen the computational burden, a two-stage acceleration algorithm is proposed, which divides the solution procedure into two stages based on two types of integer variables: load status variables and variables associated with the maintenance path and network topology. Then, the acceleration principles are proposed to determine the load status variables. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model are validated by extensive cases, which demonstrate the performance of the coordinated maintenance and reconfiguration in integrated energy systems for fault recovery.</description></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Control Strategy for F-SOP Considering Three-Phase Imbalance and Economic Operation in ISLDN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638221</link><description>With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RES) and single-phase loads, three-phase imbalance and transformer lightly/heavily loaded operation issues has become more prominent in low-voltage distribution networks (LDN). However, existing research on interconnected systems of LDN (ISLDN) rarely addresses the comprehensive management of both three-phase imbalance and lightly/heavily loaded operation issues. To this end, a comprehensive control strategy for three-phase imbalance and lightly/heavily loaded operation in ISLDN based on a four-leg soft open point (F-SOP) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the comprehensive loss characteristics model of ISLDN including the F-SOP and the transformer are established, revealing that both imbalance and load rate can affect the equipment efficiency. Secondly, considering the objective of minimizing power loss, an optimization dispatch strategy with constraints of three-phase imbalance and the optimal economic operation area is proposed to obtain the dispatch power commands for the F-SOP. Furthermore, an improved peer-to-peer control for F-SOP is proposed to ensure the conduct of the optimization dispatch strategy and enhance stability performance of system. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed comprehensive control strategy are validated by the simulations and experiments. The results show that comprehensive control of lightly/heavily loaded operation and three-phase imbalance in the ISLDN can significantly reduce daily power loss by 62%, improving system operation reliability and economy.</description></item><item><title>Graph-Based Large Scale Probabilistic PV Power Forecasting Insensitive to Space-Time Missing Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643410</link><description>In recent years, power systems integrated with distributed energy resources (DERs) have been considered to mitigate climate change. However, this makes power systems even more uncertain and complex, so uncertainty-aware accurate forecasting needs to be considered for the massive penetration of renewable energy. To this end, we propose a scalable and missing-insensitive framework for probabilistic multi-site photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting, specifically focused on large-scale PV sites and space-time missing data. By leveraging the graph neural network (GNN), the proposed scalable graph learning mechanism with random coarse graph attention and probabilistic spatio-temporal learning performs efficiently for large-scale PV sites in terms of forecasting accuracy and model training complexity. At the same time, our framework adaptively imputes the missing PV data in the space and time domain, respectively. Ablation study results demonstrate that our framework is effective for extracting complex spatial-temporal features across large-scale PV sites. Under extensive experiments, our framework shows 7$-$10% and 6$-$25% improvement on average for over 1600 PV sites and three types of space-time missing data, which ensures accurate and stable forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Dispatch Strategy for a Multi-Microgrid Cooperative Alliance Using a Two-Stage Pricing Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648707</link><description>To coordinate resources among multi-level stakeholders and enhance the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into multi-microgrids, this study proposes an optimal dispatch strategy within a multi-microgrid cooperative alliance using a nuanced two-stage pricing mechanism. Initially, the strategy assesses electric energy interactions between microgrids and distribution networks to establish a foundation for collaborative scheduling. The two-stage pricing mechanism initiates with a leader-follower game, wherein the microgrid operator acts as the leader and users as followers. Subsequently, it adjusts EV tariffs based on the game's equilibrium, taking into account factors such as battery degradation and travel needs to optimize EVs' electricity consumption. Furthermore, a bi-level optimization model refines power interactions and pricing strategies across the network, significantly enhancing demand response capabilities and economic outcomes. Simulation results demonstrate that this strategy not only increases renewable energy consumption but also reduces energy costs, thereby improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of the system.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Optimization Operation of Improved Power-to-Hydrogen-and-Heat Method at Low Temperature for Reducing Carbon Emissions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654708</link><description>The power-to-hydrogen-and-heat (P2HH) method is a potential means of improving energy efficiency while reducing carbon emissions. However, existing P2HH methods are ineffective at low temperatures, and do not consider physical constraints on heat exchange between the electrolyzer and heating network. Hence, this paper proposes an improved P2HH (IP2HH) method to overcome these shortcomings. First, this paper proposes a novel collaborative mechanism between the electrolyzer and the heating network. In this system, the electrolyzer can not only transfer excess heat to the heating network when at high temperatures, but can also be heated by the heating network when at low temperatures. Second, this paper takes the physical limitations of heat exchange between electrolyzer and heating network into consideration, and models the regulating valve of heat exchanger. These considerations allow produce simulation results that better approximate real-world scenarios. Finally, a convex model integrated with the IP2HH approach is established. Compared with the existing P2HH method, the IP2HH method may allow electrolyzer to work intermittently based on fluctuations in renewables supplies while maintaining high hydrogen production efficiency. Such improvements could reduce carbon emissions by 35.5%, costs by 10.7%, and renewables curtailment by 26.4% at ambient temperature of 1 $^{\circ }$C.</description></item><item><title>Scheduling Multiple Industrial Electrolyzers in Renewable P2H Systems: A Coordinated Active-Reactive Power Management Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654460</link><description>Utility-scale renewable power-to-hydrogen (ReP2H) systems typically consist of multiple electrolyzers (ELZs), many of which are powered by thyristor rectifiers (TRs). A TR-powered ELZ has a nonlinear and nondecouplable relation between its active and reactive loads. The on-off switching and load allocation across multiple ELZs impact the efficiency of P2H energy conversion and the active and reactive power flows in the electrical network. Improper scheduling may result in an excessive reactive load from the hydrogen plant, causing voltage violations and increased network losses, which compromise both safety and profitability. To address these issues, this paper first explores the tradeoffs between the energy efficiency and reactive loads of ELZs. Then, we propose a joint active-reactive power management method to coordinate the loads and thermal properties of the ELZs, renewables, energy storage, and var compensation to improve the overall productivity and profitability. Mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) is established to achieve these goals, and a decomposition algorithm enables its applicability in large-scale systems. Case studies show that the proposed method, at best, increases the hydrogen yield by 2.49% while reducing network losses by 3.12% compared to the state-of-the-art strategies based on wind and solar power data from Inner Mongolia, China. The optimal var resource configuration for ReP2H systems is also briefly discussed.</description></item><item><title>Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Optimal Power Flow With Renewable Energy Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660524</link><description>The serious uncertainties from the extensive integration of renewable energy generations put forward a higher real-time requirement for power system dispatching. To provide economic and feasible generation operations in real-time, a physics-informed reinforcement learning (PIRL) method based on constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) for optimal power flow (OPF) is presented in this paper. In the proposed method, a physics-informed actor based on the power flow equations is designed to generate generation operations that satisfy the equality constraints of OPF. To specify inequality constraints in actor optimization, the policy gradient is augmented with the constraints to correct unfeasible generation operations. In particular, the cost functions related to inequality constraints can be directly calculated based on the output of the actor, which is more accurate than using networks to approximate in general CRL methods. The proposed method is tested on the IEEE 118-bus system, and the simulation result shows that the proposed method achieves a significant improvement in computation speed compared with the traditional interior point method while obtaining a similar generation cost.</description></item><item><title>Exploiting the Flexibility of District Heating System for Distribution System Operation: Set-Based Characterization and Temporal Decomposition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660566</link><description>The proliferation of distributed renewable resources increases the uncertainty in distribution systems. Coupling the distribution system and district heating system helps leverage the flexibility of thermal storage and thus supports the operation of the electrical grid. This paper proposes a method to characterize flexibility from district heating system via polyhedral sets. First, a recursive robust feasibility condition that ensures heat supply adequacy under uncertain demand is established. Then, stagewise robust feasible sets of thermal storage levels are calculated using a customized projection algorithm. Finally, dynamic bounds of electric heaters are computed by a further projection step. With those dynamic bounds, the electric heaters behave like reducible loads, and the demands in each period are decoupled over time, although the dispatch of thermal storage units must comply with inter-temporal constraints. The proposed method allows the two coupled systems to be operated in a distributed way without forecasts and extensive communications. Numerical simulations on small and practically sized testing systems validate the advantage of the proposed method. On average, the set calculation takes about 8 minutes for the day-ahead problem and 11 seconds for real-time dispatch on a portable laptop, and the prediction-free operation policy has an average optimality gap of 3.6% compared to the hindsight optimum.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Volt-VAR Coordinated Scheduling With Mobile Energy Storage System for Active Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10664000</link><description>In order to improve the voltage distribution and operation cost for ADN, A scheduling strategy is designed to integrate flexible resources, particularly mobile energy storage systems, within the coupling of ADN and TN, under an uncertain environment. A day-ahead Volt-VAR coordinated scheduling framework for ADN and TN can be proposed through incorporating a data-driven day-ahead scenario generation method based on denoising diffusion probabilistic model. First, the historical data may be employed to learn the error relationship between real power curves and predicted power curves for generating RES scenarios. The probability distribution for prediction error is constructed which can describe the day-ahead output power curve of RES. Subsequently, a SCCO approach is employed to measure voltage operating risk in uncertain environment, which can effectively utilize the controllability of different resource at timescale and spatial scale in ADN to fulfill the anticipated operational requirement. Finally, The ADN coupled with TN model can be linearized and converted into the mixed-integer linear programming method. Numerical simulations based on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system coupled with 15-node transportation network may verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Photovoltaic-Grid Integrated System for the Residential Power Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10663696</link><description>This paper proposes a photovoltaic (PV)-Utility integrated system with inductive power transfer (IPT) for electric vehicle (EV) charging applications in residential management applications. To realize this objective, a buck boost-interleaved H-bridge (BBIHB) configuration is proposed to integrate the PV source with the DC link of the front end converter (FEC) while achieving maximum power from the PV and power delivery to the IPT simultaneously. The DC bus of the IPT in the proposed system is obtained through the additive connection of the PV and FEC DC-link, which results in inherent boost of the DC bus voltage for the IPT system thus enhances the transmission power for the EV charging. Furthermore, the FEC allows bidirectional power flow between the utility and BBIHB converter by sharing the deficient or excess power in the system based on PV power availability. The complete modeling of the system and a control algorithm to achieve the above mentioned objectives is presented in this paper. Other features of the proposed system include inherent voltage boosting, a simple control strategy, and the absence of a separate converter for the PV to extract maximum power. Finally, an experimental hardware setup is developed in the laboratory and tested up to 4 kW of output power to validate the proposed system's performance, achieving a maximum DC-to-DC efficiency of 94% at this condition.</description></item><item><title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Dynamic Droop Control Strategy for Real-Time Optimal Operation and Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10664502</link><description>The optimal operation of an islanded AC microgrid system is achieved by proper power sharing among generators. The conventional distributed cost optimization strategies use a communication system to converge incremental costs. However, these methods are dependent on the distributed communication network and do not consider frequency deviations for real-time load variability. Thus, this paper proposes a DRL-based dynamic droop control strategy. The proposed twin delayed DDPG-based DRL interacts with the environment to learn the optimal droop gain for reducing generation cost and frequency deviation. The trained agent uses local information to transmit dynamic droop gains to the primary controller as demand load changes. It can simplify the control structure by omitting the secondary layer for optimal operation and power quality. The proposed control strategy is designed with a centralized DRL training process and distributed execution, enabling real-time distributed optimal operation. The comparison results with conventional distributed strategy confirms better control performance of the proposed strategy. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed strategy was verified by experiment on AC microgrid testbed.</description></item><item><title>Cross-Timescale Interaction Analysis Between Current Control and Rotor Speed Control Timescale Dynamics in a High-Proportion DFIG-WT System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665985</link><description>Power electronics (PE) equipment contains multiple timescale energy storage components and control loops. As a result, the dynamic process presents multiple timescale characteristics in PE-dominated power systems. For simplicity, single timescale dynamics are often the focus of corresponding analysis, and the influence of different timescales (i.e., cross-timescale analysis) is rarely considered. However, there is an interaction effect between multiple timescale controls and energy storage components, which complicates system dynamics. In this study, the cross-timescale impact of current control on the dynamics of rotor speed control timescale are evaluated. First, based on a two-machine two-area system comprising a phase-locked loop (PLL)-synchronized doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine (WT), the influence of the PLL on cross-timescale interactions is revealed via modal analysis. Then, a current control equivalent circuit is derived for analyzing its cross-timescale influence on rotor motion, and the LC resonance mechanism related to the current control is revealed. Moreover, the impact of the PLL on cross-timescale interactions is elucidated. Finally, the cross-timescale influence phenomena and mechanisms are verified via real-time digital simulations.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Prediction of Wind Farm Cluster Power Based on Embedded Graph Structure Learning With Spatiotemporal Information Gain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669105</link><description>Ultra-short-term prediction of wind farm cluster power (UPWFCP) is of great significance for the development of intra-day power generation plan, and the power prediction accuracy is difficult to be further improved due to the chaotic effect of the weather system and the incompleteness of the information. In this regard, this paper proposes an embedded graph structure learning method for wind farm cluster (WFC) that incorporates spatiotemporal information gain (STIG) theory. The graph structure describing the spatiotemporal evolution relationship of information between wind farms (WFs) is constructed based on the spatiotemporal transfer relationship of power waveforms between WFs. An embedded graph attention network (EGAN) is proposed to learn STIG adjacency relationship among WFs, and a dynamic grouping scheme of redundant nodes in WFs based on STIG distance is constructed to reduce the modeling complexity. The proposed method is applied to the WFC of Inner Mongolia, China, and the results show that the NRMSE, NMAE, and MAPE of the proposed method are on average 2.63%, 2.09%, and 20.95% lower, and the R2 and Pr are on average 7.66% and 6.64% higher, respectively, compared with the rest of the comparison methods at all time scales.</description></item><item><title>Integrating Air-Source Heat Pumps into the Demand-Side Fast Frequency Response Service: A Study Based on Thermal Dynamic Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669175</link><description>Fast frequency response services, designed to quickly balance the electrical grid within seconds, have a critical importance for managing sudden anomalies in low-inertia power systems. Battery systems often serve as versatile prosumers on the demand side to facilitate fast frequency response services. However, the nature of fast frequency response services leads to a highly fluctuating power profile for batteries, which can shorten their lifetime. In contrast, distributed air-source heat pumps in residential areas have a substantial untapped potential to support fast frequency response services. This paper seeks to integrate them into the existing services through a controller upgrade. We analyze the influence of air-source heat pumps' inherent complex thermal dynamics on fast frequency response services, revealing control challenges posed by unpredictable operating condition changes. Such a challenge is tackled with a standard droop control structure which is tuned through ${{H}_\infty }$ method, guaranteeing practical and stable operations within the permitted operating condition range. Finally, the proposed fast frequency response service scheme is tested through multiphysics simulations on a small-size low-inertia residential microgrid. The obtained results strongly supported the proposed new service.</description></item><item><title>Globally Optimal Distributed Operation of Integrated Electric and Heating Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10677480</link><description>Unit commitment (UC) is a key player in the coordinated operation of integrated energy systems. However, the participation of multiple market entities with widely different characteristics in large-scale energy systems has urged the critical need for the application of a distributed scheme to the UC problem. The NP-hard UC problem is a challenging mixed-integer programming problem. The presence of a large number of binary variables in the UC subproblems, which are solved by each participating entity after implementing the UC decomposition, fails to guarantee the convergence and the optimality of existing solution methods. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a distributed method, using logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD), for the UC problem in a typical multi-entity system, i.e., integrated electric and heating system (IEHS). By searching the branch and bound tree of the district heating system (DHS) subproblem, the lower bound of its objective function is rigorously derived as a valid Benders cut to ensure the convergence to global optimal results. This distributed method is suitable for both deterministic and robust UC solutions. Numerical simulations are conducted on two test systems to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model and its distributed solution method.</description></item><item><title>Set-Valued Regression of Wind Power Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10678875</link><description>Precise wind power curves are pivotal for monitoring the status of wind turbines and predicting wind power, which are important parts of utilizing wind energy in power systems. However, the data sets for training wind power curve models have a critical issue. A considerable proportion of the data sets is abnormal due to communication failure and other factors. Using the data sets with abnormal data will significantly deteriorate the fitting performance. This paper resolves the above issue by proposing a unified way to achieve abnormal data detection and curve fitting. Instead of regression with scalar output, set-valued regression of the wind power curve is considered, giving a set of wind power for a given wind speed. Interval neural network is adopted as the model for set-valued regression. A chance-constrained optimization problem is formulated to train an interval neural network. The obtained interval neural network can specify a subset with the normal data area, which can be used to give the threshold for abnormal data detection. Besides, the center points of the interval can be used as the fitted wind power curve. Since the formulated chance-constrained optimization problem is intractable, a sample-based sigmoidal approximation method is proposed to approximately solve it. The convergence and probabilistic feasibility of the approximation are given. Finally, experimental validations have been conducted to compare the proposed method with several existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Preserving Normal Power Curve Data With Sparse Density via Wind Speed-Power Correlation Trend Cleaning Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10678883</link><description>Stochastic wind conditions and curtailment lead to a sparse distribution of normal data compared to outliers on the Wind Power Curve (WPC). This results in the removal of sparse normal data during the data cleaning process, hampering short-term wind power assessment and forecasting. To address this issue, this paper proposes a decision boundary construction method that utilizes the wind speed-power correlation trend to retain normal WPC data. First, leveraging the positive correlation between wind speed and power, an incremental trend search strategy is used to obtain the trend curve. Building on this curve, a scatter motion trend algorithm is introduced to eliminate densely clustered curtailed power data. Finally, a kernel function-based 3-sigma boundary construction method is suggested to further reduce the influence of remaining clustered outliers on decision boundaries. The proposed method is compared to eight advanced algorithms using data from 17 wind turbines across three wind farms, demonstrating superior performance, especially in scenarios with sparse normal data.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Inertial Control for Wind Turbine Generators in Fast Frequency Response Based on the Power Reduction Period Assessment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10678806</link><description>Fast frequency response of wind turbine generators (WTGs) is achieved by injecting incremental power to the grid followed by power reductions to avoid over-deceleration and ensure secure rotor speed recovery. Second frequency deeps (SFDs) are the results of such power reductions that are challenging during abrupt frequency transients that may lead to under-frequency load shedding, or cascading events leading to blackouts. To address this issue, this paper presents an adaptive inertial control (AIC) scheme for WTGs designed to maximize the improvement in frequency nadir without causing SFD. The proposed method is developed through an assessment of power reduction period of WTGs during fast frequency response. This analysis investigates the impacts on the system frequency of a) injecting different shares of disturbance size (SoDSs) by WTGs and b) latency/delay in power injection. Derived from this analysis, the AIC is proposed to inject the maximum possible SoDS during the over-production period and successfully stabilize and recover the rotor speed during the assigned optimal power reduction period with SFDs disabled. This is achieved by adaptively adjusting the AIC in the reduction period based on the SoDS injected by WTGs during the over-production stage. Also, the AIC is modified to adapt against wind speed deviations. To evaluate the performance of the AIC, a comprehensive verification is carried out by comparing AIC with thirteen existing inertial control schemes and maximum power point tracking control in various cases using wind-integrated IEEE 39-bus system in Digsilent PowerFactory and real-time experimental tests. The results confirm the effectiveness of AIC in terms of achieving maximum improvement in frequency nadir without generating SFD.</description></item><item><title>Causal Mechanism-Enabled Zero-Label Learning for Power Generation Forecasting of Newly-Built PV Sites</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10679087</link><description>Power forecasting of newly built photovoltaic (PV) sites faces huge challenges owing to the lack of sufficient training samples. To this end, this paper proposes an unsupervised zero-label learning method for power generation forecasting of newly built PV sites without relying on any historical power output data. The main idea is to extract invariant causal structures across different PV sites and leverage this causality to enhance the power forecasting performance on the newly built ones. In particular, a causality-enabled domain adaptation network (CEDAN) is designed to capture the causal mechanism of PV generation from the multiple fine-grain segments of time-lagged data. It relaxes the causal relationships to an associative structure which is further concretized as attention score vectors through the designed intra- and inter-variable attention mechanisms. To quantify the distribution discrepancies between source and target domain causal structures, a specific domain adaptation loss function is designed for the optimization of CEDAN. It is further extended to a domain adaptation quantile loss to handle the uncertainties of PV power output. By jointly minimizing the domain adaptation loss and power forecasting error/conditional quantile loss, an invariant power generation causal mechanism across data domains for a newly built PV site can be learned. This allows the proposed method to achieve accurate and highly generalized power generation forecasting for newly built PV sites without relying on labeled data. Extensive experiments utilizing real PV generation data demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art transfer learning methods by 7.57% at least in deterministic forecasting and 8.37% at least in probabilistic forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Startup Control of Grid-Forming Offshore Wind Turbines Connected to the Diode-Rectifier-Based HVDC Link</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680154</link><description>The Diode-Rectifier (DR) based HVDC has been considered as an economical solution to connect remote offshore wind turbines (WTs) to the onshore power grid. However, the DR is a passive device and cannot support the startup of the WTs. Therefore, it is worth finding an appropriate and cost-effective startup strategy for the DR-connected WTs. This paper investigates to use of wind energy to startup those WTs to avoid the need for additional grid support or the energy storage system, which can reduce the overall cost of such transmission system. The first challenge for this strategy is that the output active power of WTs can be extremely low during the startup process, which puts the WT rotor at a high risk of overspeed. Another challenge is to prevent power surges between synchronizing WTs. To address those issues, the pitch control has been innovated for the DR-connected WTs. In addition, a seamless synchronization control of the DR-connected WTs is proposed, which does not need the phase-locked-loop and can facilitate the whole startup process of the DR-connected WTs. The feasibility of these proposed control strategies for the startup of the DR-connected WTs is verified by comprehensive simulation studies.</description></item><item><title>Reliability-Based Planning of Cable Layout for Offshore Wind Farm Electrical Collector System Considering Post-Fault Network Reconfiguration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681539</link><description>The electrical collector system (ECS) plays a crucial role in determining the performance of offshore wind farms (OWFs). Existing research has predominantly restricted ECS cable layouts to conventional radial or ring structures and employed graph theory heuristics for solutions. However, both economic efficiency and reliability of the OWFs heavily depend on their ECS structure, and the optimal ECS cable layout often deviates from typical configurations. In this context, this paper introduces a novel reliability-based ECS cable layout planning method for large-scale OWFs, employing a two-stage stochastic programming approach to address uncertainties of wind power and contingencies. To enhance reliability, the model incorporates optimal post-fault network reconfiguration strategies by adjusting wind turbine power supply paths through link cables. To tackle computation challenges arising from numerous contingency scenarios, a customized progressive contingency incorporation (CPCI) framework is developed to solve the model with higher efficiency by iteratively identifying non-trivial scenarios and solving the simplified problems. The convergence and optimality are theoretically proven. Numerical tests on several real-world OWFs validate the necessity of fully optimizing ECS structures and demonstrate the efficiency of the CPCI algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Transient Interaction Mechanism Analysis and Stability Control of Multi-Paralleled DFIG-Based WTs During Asymmetrical Grid Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681307</link><description>In this article, from the perspective of DC-link voltage (DCV) control, the transient interaction mechanism of multi-paralleled doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbines (WTs) is investigated during asymmetrical grid faults. Firstly, considering the coupling characteristics of positive and negative sequence (PNS) components and the interaction characteristics between the rotor side converter (RSC) and grid side converter (GSC), a large-signal nonlinear model of multiple-parallel DFIG-based WTs in DC-link voltage control time-scale is obtained. Furthermore, by using the energy function method, the dynamic interaction mechanism of multiple-parallel DFIG-based WTs is analyzed. The influence of different parameters on the transient characteristics of DC-link voltage is analyzed by using phase trajectory diagram. The dominant factors affecting the transient stability of the WTs and stability level of DC-link voltage are obtained. In addition, considering the interaction among WTs, the dynamic interaction between RSC and GSC, as well as the requirement of grid codes, a transient stability optimization strategy during asymmetrical grid faults is proposed to improve the transient stability level of the DC-link voltage and the transient stability of multiple-parallel DFIG-based WTs. Finally, simulation and experimental results validate the correctness of theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Reactive Power Optimization for Flexible Distribution Networks With Successive Relaxation Iteration Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682812</link><description>The flexible soft open point (SOP) connected to active distribution networks (ADNs) offers a promising manner of improving voltage and VAR control (VVC) by providing flexible power regulation. Due to the expansion of interconnective networks, the centralized optimization method has recently faced various challenges. This paper thus proposes a novel distributed coordinated reactive power optimization strategy for SOP-based multiregional ADNs based on local model decoupling and iterative interactions. By applying the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), the centralized VVC optimization problem is divided into several subproblems, allowing each area to optimize its local subproblem in a fully distributed manner. Multiple resources are thereby coordinated by the VVC, including both discrete and continuous devices. To ensure computability of both integer and non-convex problems, the relaxation iteration and successive linear approximation methods are nested to the ADMM framework, within this approach to allow ready solution to the distributed VVC optimization problem to be generated using a relaxation iterative algorithm, which significantly improves algorithm convergence and computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in this work using a modified IEEE standard interconnection system.</description></item><item><title>Fast Power Regulation Method During System Restoration for D-PMSG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10685139</link><description>The speed of the pitch action is one of the primary constraints that limit the power ramp rate of wind turbines (WTs). By storing kinetic energy (KE) within the wind wheel, blades, and generator rotor, the output power of the WT can be regulated more rapidly with less pitch action. This capability is beneficial in specific situations where additional power injection is required by the external system, such as during the system restoration process after a blackout. In this paper, a novel fast power regulation method for direct-drive PMSG-based (D-PMSG-based) WTs is proposed. This method allows for the early completion of the most time-consuming pitch reduction process and ensures that KE can be stored within the WT before the external system becomes available. As a result, the WT will be able to achieve maximum power output before the system restoration is fully completed. The potential operation boundary and the maximum external power support capability of D-PMSG-based WTs are analyzed. By following the operation boundary, converter modulation problem caused by high KE reserve can be avoided. The proposed fast power regulation method can significantly reduce the power increase speed and maximize the output power capability of D-PMSG-base WTs.</description></item><item><title>Research on PV Hosting Capacity of Distribution Networks Based on Data-Driven and Nonlinear Sensitivity Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693542</link><description>Voltage calculations are critical for assessing photovoltaic hosting capacity; however, acquiring precise parameters and the topology of the medium voltage distribution networks poses a significant challenge, thereby rendering traditional power flow computational methods ineffective. To address this issue, this paper introduces a hybrid method that utilizes a data-driven approach in conjunction with nonlinear functions to determine node voltages. Firstly, a deep neural network model for distribution network's power flow and voltage-power sensitivity analysis is established using historical data. This model captures the data-driven error, which reduces time consumption and increases accuracy. Secondly, a fourth-order Taylor expansion of power to voltage is derived based on the power flow mathematical equation to extrapolate voltage. This is necessary because when photovoltaic generators are connected to the nodes, the load data often exceeds the historical data range, rendering neural networks inapplicable. Finally, the sparrow search algorithm is employed to determine the hosting capacity. The proposed methods are validated using IEEE 33 and IEEE 69 case systems, demonstrating that the data-driven approach, combined with nonlinear functions, can ensure the accuracy in obtaining node voltage and the hosting capacity.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Evaluation to Power System Oscillation Damping Capability of DFIG-POD Based on Path Damping Torque Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693531</link><description>The increasing wind power decreases power system damping and may intensify low-frequency oscillation (LFO). The LFO are usually damped by the power system stabilizer (PSS) at synchronous generator (SG), and now by the power oscillation damper (POD) at doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). The existing damping torque analysis (DTA) sets the parameters of the PSS and evaluates its damping capability, but can not be applied to the POD due to the difficulty of finding the damping path related to the DFIG and the coupling between the POD and the DFIG, which are studied in this paper. At first, the analytical expression of the coupling between the POD and DFIG is newly derived with linear fractional transformation (LFT) technique. Then the path damping torque analysis (PDTA) is proposed to reconstruct the damping path of the POD. Thirdly, the damping indicator based on the return difference matrix is proposed to evaluate the contribution of damping path to the LFO. Finally, numerical results of test system are given to validate effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model, and parameter optimization to the multi-input POD (MIPOD) is performed to show the application value of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Spatiotemporal Adversarial Domain Generalization for Locating Subsynchronous Oscillation Sources Under Unseen Conditions in Large-Scale Renewable Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693450</link><description>Subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs) in renewable power systems have emerged as a major challenge, jeopardizing the stability and safety of power system operations. Thus, it is essential to accurately and timely locate SSO sources. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods for locating SSO sources have become increasingly popular, existing AI-based methods usually fail in practical applications due to unavailable or insufficient real-world SSO data for model training, and significant distribution gaps in samples under different operational conditions. They also fail to fully utilize the temporal characteristics of oscillations and the spatial topology of the system. Moreover, these methods only focus on locating either negative-damping-SSO or forced-SSO sources. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel strategy termed Spatiotemporal-Adversarial-Domain-Generalization (STADG) to locate oscillation sources in both SSO scenarios of real power systems. This method allows the model to train on multi-source domains (simplified-simulation power systems) with sufficient labeled samples, and to be directly applied to an unseen test target domain (real power system) under unknow operating conditions. The proposed approach employs a graph-attention network and a long-short-term-memory network to fully leverage spatial and temporal features of SSOs. Extensive experiments on the modified IEEE-39 and WECC-179 bus systems confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Two-Level Distributed Consensus Control of Multiple Wind Farms for Fast Frequency Support</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10694712</link><description>The neighboring wind farms have great frequency support potential. The wind turbine generators (WTGs) in these wind farms are influenced by wake effects and have different frequency support capabilities. In order to fully utilize the WTGs' support capabilities under different operating states, this paper proposes a two-level distributed consensus (TLDC) control to cooperate all the WTGs. Level I is leader-follower control, which is equipped within the wind farms. Level II is leaderless control which is used among the wind farms. This method is able to assign different values of power commands to different WTGs in the system to achieve better frequency support effect and stability. Based on MATLAB/Simulink and Opal-RT real-time simulation platforms, the two-area power system and Guangshui system (100% renewable energy power system) are analyzed, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed TLDC method has a better effect compared with other frequency support methods. It can also flexibly respond to communication interruptions and delays.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Stage Integrated Transmission and Distribution Expansion Planning Under Uncertainties With Smart Investment Options</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10694803</link><description>The shift towards a decentralized paradigm in power systems in response to decarbonization and deregulation efforts necessitates stronger coordination between transmission and distribution operators for cost-effective operation and planning. However, long-term uncertainties in the transition to net-zero are posing major challenges for decision-making. Moreover, literature has traditionally focused on the transmission and distribution expansion planning problems independently, as is customary in industry, leading to a lack of sophisticated integrated planning methods and inefficient expansion decisions in practice. This paper proposes a novel multi-stage stochastic programming framework for the integrated transmission and active distribution networks expansion planning under multi-dimensional uncertainties. Infrastructure investments are co-optimized with non-network alternatives with diverse techno-economic characteristics to support flexible planning. To manage the increased computational complexities, a machine learning-assisted multi-cut Benders decomposition approach is implemented. The case studies firstly highlight the strategic and economic advantages of the proposed multi-stage formulation, and then demonstrate the significant role and value of smart investment options in managing uncertainty. Lastly, the application of the proposed model on a study involving a 229-bus test system and 18 long-term scenarios validates its scalability and practical applicability.</description></item><item><title>Interaction Modeling and Stability Analysis of Grid-Forming Energy Storage System Based on SISO Transfer Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10700987</link><description>With the rapid expansion of photovoltaic (PV), grid-forming energy storage systems (GFM-ESS) have been widely employed for inertia response and voltage support to enhance the dynamic characteristics. Converters with different synchronization methods represent significant differences in dynamic behavior. The interactions between grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) devices with multi-time scale control may lead to small-signal instability in hybrid systems. This paper investigates a grid-connected system comprising a grid-forming energy storage system and a grid-following PV system (GFL-PV). Based on single-input-single-output (SISO) transfer functions, a dynamic interaction model for the PV-ESS system is established. Combining the open-loop transfer functions of full-loop and sub-loop, the proposed model reveals how GFM-ESS modifies the dynamic characteristics of GFL-PV under weak grid conditions. Subsequently, the impact of different control loops and parameters on the small-signal stability of the system is analyzed. The stability margins of both devices are also compared through the SISO model. Electromagnetic transient simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink and experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed models and analyses.</description></item><item><title>Impedance Characteristic Analysis and Phase-Locked Angle Feedforward-Based Stability Improvement for LCC-HVDC in Sending AC Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10704965</link><description>With the increasing penetration of wind power, the line-commutated converter-based high-voltage direct-current (LCC-HVDC) system in sending AC grid faces a potential risk of sub/super-synchronous oscillations (SSSOs), which threatens the stability of the power system. The impedance-based method is an effective way to analyze and suppress the SSSOs. However, since the effects of each control part in LCC-HVDC on the stability of sending AC grid are not yet well-investigated, there is a lack of theoretical guidance for implementing the impedance reshaping strategy for LCC-HVDC. Therefore, this paper establishes and analyzes the modular impedance model of LCC-HVDC, to elucidate the contribution of each control part and the interaction between different control loops. On this basis, an impedance reshaping strategy based on phase-locked angle feedforward (PAF) is proposed to improve system stability by attenuating the interaction. Compared to the existing virtual impedance-based method, the proposed PAF-based method addresses its possible failure in suppressing the SSSOs of sending AC grid. The theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the aforementioned conclusions and the effectiveness of the proposed impedance reshaping strategy.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Operation Flexibility in Modular Power to Hydrogen Based Ammonia Industries</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10706701</link><description>Modularization of Hydrogen Electrolyzers (HEs) is projected to be immediate, resilient, and efficient for load management in large-scale Hydrogen Consuming Industries (HCIs). It offers a scalable and flexible solution that can adapt to changes in hydrogen and power system demands. However, Modular HEs are studied primarily as small-scale wind hydrogen systems only, converting excess Renewable Energy (RE) into hydrogen without the integration of rigid downstream operations. Downstream constraints in HCIs, like rigid hydrogen demands, device operational/ramping limits, and storage constraints, can limit or regulate modular HE's use for power system services. Furthermore, oversimplified HE operational modeling within HCIs leads to suboptimal outcomes for integrated modular HCI and RE-rich power system (RPS) operations, resulting in RE curtailments and inaccurate flexibility estimations. This happens due to improper loading rates arising from unrealistic inter and intra-modular HE operations. This work proposes a comprehensive model for modular HE management in integrated ammonia (HCI) and power systems for flexibility in sector-coupled scenarios. The work considers and demonstrates how downstream constraints regulate HEs flexibility through a unit commitment problem framework. HE operations with detailed and extended electrochemical dynamics are considered to improve and enhance operational flexibility calculations of growing RPS-based modular HCIs. This allows for better sectoral integration and estimation of power system services.</description></item><item><title>An Overvoltage-Averse Model for Renewable-Rich AC/DC Distribution Networks Considering the Sensitivity of Voltage Violation Probability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709908</link><description>The increasing renewable generation increase the probability of voltage violation. The spatial and temporal power transfer can be achieved in AC/DC distribution networks based on voltage source converters (VSCs) and energy storage (ES), which can effectively avoid system voltage violation. However, the existing voltage violation mitigation methods in uncertain scenarios are either limited by the long solution time or complex modeling, which are difficult to meet the overvoltage probability reduction requirements of intra-day dispatch. In addition, the power transfer will simultaneously affect interconnected systems because the power is coupled through the VSCs. Overvoltage probability reduction on one line may lead to an increase on the other. This paper proposes a two-stage overvoltage-averse model considering the sensitivity of voltage violation probability. The proposed method analytically depicts the impact of power adjustment on the system overvoltage probability. The day-ahead optimization model is established as chance-constrained model. The intra-day optimization model is established as a quadratic convex model, which can be efficiently solved. Simulation results verify that the method proposed can effectively achieve the overvoltage probability reduction of renewable-rich AC/DC distribution networks.</description></item><item><title>A Mimicking-Avoiding Short-Term Probabilistic Power Forecasting Method for Wave Energies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709879</link><description>Wave energy is essential for sustainable marine development. However, complex marine weather conditions cause fluctuating wave power outputs, resulting in a mimicking phenomenon in predictions. Moreover, the lack of accurate numerical weather prediction (NWP) data sources aggravates the prediction inaccuracy. To address these obstacles, a series characteristic perception (SCP) method coordinated with an advanced hybrid model, the quantile liberty loss gated recurrent unit kernel density estimation (QLB-GRU-KDE), is proposed for the floating point absorber wave energy system. In the first stage, the SCP method gains prior knowledge via ensemble approaches. In the second stage, a liberty loss function is used to mitigate the mimicking phenomenon. Furthermore, a hybrid model that integrates a GRU and KDE is adopted for the probabilistic forecasting of wave energy generation. In addition, a metric is proposed to evaluate the severity of the mimicking. A case study based on a real-world wave dataset is conducted, where both deterministic and probabilistic prediction approaches are examined. Comparisons with the cutting-edge counterparts reveal that the designed liberty loss effectively mitigates the mimicking issue. The comprehensive performance of the proposed model, including the accuracy, stability, reliability and sharpness in wave power prediction, is validated by multiple metrics.</description></item><item><title>Approximate Optimal Energy Management of Thermal-HESS System for MIMO Fuzzy Logic Controller Based AGC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10710156</link><description>Compared to one-type of energy storage device, hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) offer benefits for Auto generation control (AGC) command tracking and can reduce investment in energy storage. Traditional control method, although effective in meeting the matching of AGC commands at a specific moment, often lacks coordination across multiple time intervals, resulting in frequent and irregular charging/ discharging which reduces the overall lifetime. To address this, this paper presents an approximate optimal operation strategy for Thermal-HESS system, aiming to enhance the AGC performance of the generating unit and improve the energy management capability of the HESSs. Firstly, an auto-adjust Markov Chain prediction method is proposed to forecast the power demand of the AGC command tracking to determine power demand's tendency. Secondly, a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC)-based optimal model, which considers the current step and cost-to-go function, is proposed. However, the SMPC based model is multiple-step optimal operational problem, which will increase the computational burden of the controller. Therefore, this paper further designs a Multiple-Input-Multiple-output (MIMO) fuzzy logic controller to approximate the optimal alternative to the cost-to-go function of SMPC model, meeting the computational and application requirements more effectively. Finally, numerical case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in AGC command tracking and HESSs energy management.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Resilience of Urban Electric-Road-Metro Interdependent Network Considering Electric Bus Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10711253</link><description>With the increasing electrification of urban transportation, urban power and traffic systems are highly coupled and influence each other, leading to a challenge for the post-event resilience enhancement of urban electric-traffic interdependent network (ETIN). In this context, we propose a multi-layer electric-metro-road interdependent network where the metro network (MN) depends on the distribution power network (DPN) and interacts with the road traffic network (RTN) synchronously. Electric buses (EBs), as one public dispatchable resource, are considered and explored to provide bridging routes for disabled MNs and supply power for failed DPNs, with consideration of three different service trips, i.e., the original trip, bridging trip, and charge-discharge trip. On this basis, a spatio-temporal network-based EB route schedule model is constructed. To consider the evacuation demand of affected MN routes, a fast DPN restoration strategy is proposed to minimize the time cost of lost load by integrating the network reconfiguration with the collaborative allocation of repair crews (RCs) and EBs. Finally, a distributed method is further devised for the coordination among different stakeholders. The proposed method is verified on two electric-traffic systems to show that the collaborative scheduling of RCs and EBs can effectively enhance the resilience of ETIN under metro service disruptions.</description></item><item><title>An Integrated Sparse Gated Graph Density Network Based on Transfer Learning for Multi-Site Probabilistic Forecasting of Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10714034</link><description>Large-scale new energy grid-connected poses significant challenges to the safe and efficient operation of smart grids. Renewable energy probabilistic forecasting (REPF) technology can analyze uncertainties in power generation, quantitatively balance risks, and prevent the breakdown of the grid. However, current REPF methods reliant on spatio-temporal maps fail to accurately estimate the probability density function (PDF) of renewable energy, resulting lacking comprehensive uncertainty analysis for distributed power generation systems (DPGS). To fill this gap, in this study, an integrated sparse gated graph density network (ISGGDN) that incorporates transfer learning to tackle the REPF challenge. A sparse gated graph dynamic convolutional network based on cross attention and residual connection is developed, which can effectively extract spatial features and spatio-temporal interactions between sites and improve the accuracy of probabilistic prediction. Furthermore, to effectively identify the types of features lost during the transfer process and to enhance the transfer learning (TL) capability, we developed an integrated approach involving multiple fine-tuning strategies based on TL. We evaluated the proposed model using wind and photovoltaic (PV) power generation data from two neighboring multi-sites, and the experimental results demonstrate that ISGGDN outperforms other existing solutions in terms of accuracy and effectiveness in REPF.</description></item><item><title>Aggregating Large-Scale Residential Users for Regulation Reserve Provision: Truthful Combinatorial Auction Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715698</link><description>The proliferation of flexible loads has empowered residential users in contributing both upward and downward frequency regulation reserves to the power grid. Due to barriers like minimum bid size, residential users with relatively small power consumption must be aggregated before they can enter the reserve market. However, the large number of residential users renders the aggregation mechanism design problem a challenging task. In particular, the cost for reserve provision of each user is not only highly heterogeneous, but also coupled through both the temporal dimension and the up/down regulation direction. In order to allow the users to fully express their costs, in this paper, we propose a combinatorial reverse auction (CRA) framework as the market mechanism for user aggregation. In this auction, the aggregator is the auctioneer and procures reserves from residential users. The users submit package bids consisting of combinations of both upward and downward reserves over multiple time-slots, capturing the coupling in the user cost. Furthermore, to address the infamous computational challenges of large-scale combinatorial auctions, we develop a novel fast combinatorial auction (FCA) mechanism that can be solved in polynomial time. It includes an approximate winner determination algorithm and a critical payment scheme. Notably, our proposed mechanism is rigorously proved to possess desirable economic properties such as truthfulness and individual rationality. Extensive simulations have validated the theoretic properties of the proposed CRA mechanism and its advantages over existing methods. In particular, compared with the widely employed truthful Vickery-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, CRA can be $10^{4}$ times faster than VCG when the user number is above 1000. Meanwhile, it is able to achieve near-optimal social cost, where the average optimality loss is 2.92%.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Planning for Stability Enhancement in High IBR-Penetrated Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10716464</link><description>Security and stability challenges in future power systems with high penetration Inverter-Based Resources (IBR) have been anticipated as one of the main barriers to decarbonization. Grid-following IBRs may become unstable under small disturbances in weak grids, while during transient processes, system stability and protection may be jeopardized due to the lack of sufficient Short-Circuit Current (SCC). To solve these challenges and achieve decarbonization, the future system has to be carefully planned. However, it remains unclear how both small-signal and transient stabilities can be considered during the system planning stage. In this context, this paper proposes a coordinated planning model of different resources in the transmission system, namely the synchronous condensers and GFM IBRs to enhance system stability. The system strength and SCC constraints are analytically derived by considering the different characteristics of synchronous units and IBRs, which are further effectively linearized through a novel data-driven approach, where an active sampling method is proposed to generate a representative data set. The significant economic value of the proposed coordinated planning framework in both system asset investment and system operation is demonstrated through detailed case studies.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Swing PLL Synchronization Transient Stability of Grid-Connected Paralleled Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10720168</link><description>During grid faults, the grid-connected paralleled converter systems is susceptible to a phase-locked loop (PLL) synchronization transient instability. Most existing studies focus on first-swing transient stability analysis using the equal-area criterion. However, achieving first-swing transient stability does not guarantee overall stability, as the system may still experience multi-swing transient instability. This paper analyzes the type of multi-swing transient instability issue from two aspects: transient instability mechanism and transient stability assessment. Firstly, the mechanism of multi-swing transient instability is revealed from the transient energy conversion point of view. Then, considering transient interactions between converters, the largest estimated domain of attraction (LEDA) is constructed utilizing the Takagi-Sugeno method. Using the LEDA, the multi-swing transient instability problem of the grid-connected paralleled converter systems is quantitatively analyzed. Finally, the theoretical results are verified based on the RT-LAB hardware-in-the-loop experimental platform.</description></item><item><title>Peak Shaving Control for a Virtual Synchronous Generator in Island Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10749988</link><description>A virtual synchronous generator (VSG) can be considered a voltage source with an emulated inertial response. Depending on the grid condition, however, it is necessary to limit the output current, which renders the inverter dynamics and makes the inverter prone to losing synchronism with the grid. To address this well-known challenge, in this article, we propose a novel control method for a VSG that can achieve current limiting with stability. We describe the proposed VSG with block diagrams and validate its control responses with transfer functions. The proposed VSG can be useful to enhance the frequency stability of an island grid, which is more vulnerable to disturbances by nature than a large interconnected system. We use a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) setup for further validation. Using the HIL environment, we test the proposed VSG in an island system operating with diesel generators for generator trips, low-frequency oscillations, and voltage sags. We also test the VSG in a single-inverter-infinite-bus setup to evaluate its transient stability and compare it to ones with conventional current-limiting methods. Although the current limiting shaves the peak power of the VSG, it ensures continuous inertial and damping responses without compromising stability.</description></item><item><title>Performance-Guaranteed Finite-Time Secondary Control for Islanded AC Microgrids With Time-Varying Disturbances</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829834</link><description>This paper investigates distributed finite-time secondary control of islanded AC microgrids with prescribed performance subject to time-varying disturbances. By specifying the desired performance function, the transient and steady-state performances (including the convergence rate, the maximum overshoot, and the maximum steady-state error) of both the voltage and frequency restoration processes are considered in the design phase. Given the microgrid modeling inaccuracies and load-switching effects, the time-varying disturbances lump unmodeled dynamics, parameter perturbations, and exogenous load disturbances. A novel control scheme, which consists of two main parts, is established. In the first part, reference signal generators are constructed to produce the restoration references in a finite time for each power unit. In the second part, with the observer-based disturbance rejection technique and the prescribed performance control philosophy, performance-guaranteed finite-time secondary controllers are designed such that the finite-time restoration task with the prescribed performance is fulfilled, and the time-varying disturbance rejection is achieved. Rigorous stability analysis and case studies are conducted to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Coordination of Smart Hybrid Transformers in Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10770240</link><description>A hybrid transformer is a combination of a conventional transformer and power electronics, which can be used to help alleviate power quality issues in distribution networks at lower costs than solid-state transformers. This paper proposes a novel method of coordinating multiple hybrid transformers in 3-phase distribution networks in order to reduce the curtailment of distributed generators. This is accomplished through the use of sequential linear programming, key features of which include accounting for the nonlinear voltage control capabilities of hybrid transformers, and managing the nonlinear constraints of hybrid transformer power electronics. Test cases were carried out in a modified unbalanced version of the IEEE 69-Bus network and a reduced version of the European Low Voltage test feeder. Test case results demonstrate that hybrid transformers can substantially increase the utilisation of distributed generators.</description></item><item><title>Frequency Constrained Proactive Scheduling for Secure Microgrid Formation in Wind Power Penetrated Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819485</link><description>Microgrid formation (MF) is a core solution for increasing the resilience of distribution systems in extreme situations. However, a significant power imbalance at the MF onset will result in the violation of dynamic frequency constraints, especially in low-inertia wind power penetrated distribution systems (WPP-DSs). To ensure the secure MF after emergencies, this paper proposes a frequency constrained proactive scheduling method for WPP-DSs. The primary frequency response (PFR) model is proposed to describe the microgrid frequency dynamics after islanding, where wind turbines are deloaded to provide a primary reserve. Then the PFR model is incorporated into the scheduling model to ensure frequency security during MF process. The proposed method proactively dispatches controllable units to mitigate the power imbalance and to reserve power for frequency regulation. After emergencies, the primary reserve is released, and adaptive microgrids are securely formed to sustain critical services. The PFR model is formulated as algebraic differential equations (ADEs), which makes it difficult to solve the model directly. Thus, the PFR model is discretized into difference equations and further linearized to facilitate solution. Simulation results validate the merits of the proposed method in reducing the conservatism of proactive scheduling strategies and improving the microgrid security during MF process.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Timescale Security Evaluation and Regulation of Integrated Electricity and Heating System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747833</link><description>The ability to operate across multiple timescales is vital for the flexibility enhancement of integrated electricity and heating systems (IEHS). Nonetheless, the common dependence on numerical solvers operating in discrete spaces poses a challenge in accurately representing their inherent multi-timescale properties, thereby compromising system security. In response, this paper proposes a novel multi-timescale matching method in continuous space to get rid of resolution constraints, circumventing discretization issues while deriving an explicit formulation for thermal dynamics. This forms the groundwork for establishing the global sensitivity factors to quantify the interdependencies within the IEHS. On this basis, a rolling security evaluation and regulation strategy that is cognizant of the asynchronous behaviors in power and heating systems is tailored. Case studies validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method to ensure the IEHS&#8217;s security.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Coordinated Robust Planning of Multi-Energy Ship Microgrids Considering Thermal Inertia and Ship Navigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10834446</link><description>As maritime technology advances, multi-energy ship microgrids (MESMs) are widely used in large cruise tourism. In this context, studying cost-effective and highly reliable energy system planning methods for MESMs in their whole lifespan becomes paramount. Therefore, this paper proposes a joint planning method for a MESM during its lifespan. Firstly, a long timescale coordinated planning and operation scheme is formulated with the aim of maximizing the Net Present Value (NPV) value, thereby reducing both project investment and energy supply cost. In addition, this paper introduces novel operation models that incorporate customer thermal comfort levels, considering thermal inertia, and ship navigation, accounting for the effects of waves and wind. These models enhance the flexibility and practicality of the planning process. Finally, to ensure the safe operation of vessel and alleviate the negative effects of uncertain wind and waves during ship navigation, a robust optimization (RO) approach is employed. A case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, with several comparison analyses further highlighting its advantages.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Robust Planning for Park-Level Integrated Energy System Considering Uncertain Equipment Contingency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10834468</link><description>To enhance the reliability of Integrated Energy Systems (IESs) and address the research gap in reliability-based planning methods, this paper proposes a two-stage robust planning model specifically for park-level IESs. The proposed planning model considers uncertainties like load demand fluctuations and equipment contingencies, and provides a reliable scheme of equipment selection and sizing for IES investors. Inspired by the unit commitment problem, we formulate an equipment contingency uncertainty set to accurately describe the potential equipment contingencies which happen and can be repaired within a day. Then, a modified nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm is applied to solve this two-stage robust planning model with integer recourse efficiently. In the case study, the role of energy storage system for IES reliability enhancement is analyzed in detail. Computational results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model over other planning models in terms of improving reliability.</description></item><item><title>Resilient Preparation and Restoration Strategy for Integrated Electric-Gas Distribution Systems Considering Mobile Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10835752</link><description>Extreme events can interrupt both electricity and gas supply in an integrated electric-gas distribution system (IEGDS). This work proposes a two-stage resilient preparation and restoration strategy to efficiently restore both electric and gas load services in IEGDS after extreme events considering the utilization of mobile energy storage (MES). To minimize the load loss under the damage uncertainty and limited MES resources, a unified MES assigning and dispatching strategy is proposed to optimally coordinate the numbers and locations of pre-event and post-event MES dispatching. To address the MES assigning and pre-event dispatching problems under the damage uncertainty, a two-stage stochastic optimization model is developed, which is efficiently solved by a proposed selective progressive hedging (PH) algorithm. The out-of-sample analysis indicates that the proposed methods can achieve a 53.10% reduction in average load loss compared to scenarios without MES. In addition, the proposed unified MES assigning and dispatching strategy outperforms the preparation-only and restoration-only MES dispatching strategies by reducing 2.65% and 7.13% of average load loss, respectively. Moreover, the proposed selective algorithm can reduce 7.23% to 30.53% of the computational burden compared to the conventional PH algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Time Scale Model Predictive Control-Based Demand Side Management for a Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750304</link><description>The microgrid (MG) integrating clean renewable energy has increasingly emerged as a critical solution for addressing energy challenges and promoting sustainable energy development. However, the inherent uncertainties in renewable energy output and load consumption present significant challenges to the economic and stable operation of the MG. This paper investigates a multi-time model predictive control (MSMPC) strategy for the optimal scheduling of grid-connected MG. The proposed method can dynamically update the optimal scheduling of the MG on two-time scales based on real-time measurement data. The dispatchable thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) are incorporated into the demand side management (DSM) system to enhance flexibility and satisfy the future trend of a larger proportion of controllable TCLs. Furthermore, the TCL model considers the aging problem associated with excessive compressor cycling and the satisfaction of end users. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the economic performance and robustness of the MG system. Moreover, a real-time experiment conducted using RT-LAB further verifies the feasibility of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced Privacy-Preservation in Smart Grid Power Charging Coordination</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10759805</link><description>With the significant growth in the industry of energy storage units (ESUs) and plug-in electric vehicles, charging coordination becomes critical to avoid electric grid overload. However, without effective methods to secure the charging requests, malicious users can eavesdrop on the communication between the ESUs and the grid to extract sensitive users&#8217; information. Therefore, privacy preservation is a must in the design of charging coordination schemes. To address this critical issue, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving charging coordination scheme that allows the aggregator to allocate optimized amounts of charging power to all available ESUs in the community without knowing their individual charging requests details. In particular, based on aggregated secret key communication, best-effort, and cooperative power allocation schemes, the proposed coordination scheme totally hides the sensitive data from all the nodes in the network and performs the power allocation in a semi-blind fashion. Using extensive simulations, we show that our proposed scheme can achieve almost the same performance as that of charging coordination schemes in the literature based on full knowledge of the charging requests while outperforming them by an enhanced level of security. In particular, numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme can allocate 95% of what traditional schemes allocate while keeping ESU information private. Despite the anonymity and collaborative nature of the algorithm, the average convergence time is around 2.7 iterations, with 50% to 100% of cases converging in one iteration.</description></item><item><title>Production Scheduling Identification: An Inverse Optimization Approach for Industrial Load Modeling Using Smart Meter Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769532</link><description>To cost-effectively manage the supply-demand balance of the power system, the flexibility of industrial users could be harnessed through demand-side response. To minimize the negative impact on the production of industrial users during demand-side response, general-purpose models such as the state-task network (STN) are widely used to model the energy-consuming constraints of industrial production processes. However, the required model parameters cannot be set because the required data are privately owned by industrial users and are not directly available, hindering the accurate modeling of industrial loads. In this paper, we propose production scheduling identification (PSI), an inverse-optimization-based approach for industrial load modeling under incomplete information. In PSI, industrial users&#8217; smart meter data are used to identify production scheduling parameters, thus addressing the problem of accurate load modeling when private data are unavailable. We implemented PSI with a modified STN and proposed a practical algorithm to obtain an effective solution. Numerical tests showed that PSI can identify the model parameters of a steel powder plant and a cement plant with acceptable accuracy, using only 21 days of hourly smart meter data. Compared with accurate models established with direct access to private data, the modeling error does not exceed 8.5% and 5.2%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Controlling Air Conditioners for Frequency Regulation: A Real-World Example</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10783092</link><description>Even though thermostatically controlled loads like air conditioners present a great potential for providing ancillary services to the electric power grid, the practical challenges associated with their real-time coordination have not received the necessary attention. In this work, we present a nondisruptive load control application, specifically, we demonstrate how real residential air conditioners can provide frequency regulation. Aggregate power adjustment is achieved by modifying the ON/OFF modes of the air conditioners. To account for both single and multi-zone houses, we extend the currently available techniques and develop an approach that can be used for controlling aggregations that include both types of houses. A discussion of the practical challenges encountered in our field experiments is provided, along with the hardware and software approaches we developed to circumvent them. We argue that limitations of current thermostat APIs introduce significant challenges and are an impediment to widespread adoption of fast load control applications.</description></item><item><title>Carbon-Aware Scheduling of Thermostatically Controlled Loads: A Bilevel DRCC Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10820107</link><description>Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), including air conditioners, heat pumps, water heaters, and refrigerators, play a pivotal role in demand response due to their thermal inertia and inherent flexibility. TCLs also substantially impact energy consumption and emissions within commercial and residential buildings, which makes them critical for the low-/zero-carbon transition that the building sector is undergoing to meet global climate objectives. To aid in this process, this paper proposes a carbon-aware robust scheduling approach for TCLs. The proposed approach precisely models carbon emissions attributed to TCLs, and formulates TCL scheduling as a distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) optimization problem to ensure robust decision-making. We then develop a novel bilevel optimization reformulation strategy to address challenges such as over-conservatism and computational intractability that often arise from solving DRCC problems using conventional approaches. Real-world data evaluation demonstrates significant reductions in costs and carbon emissions compared to state-of-the-art methods, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach in potentially decarbonizing the building sector.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Hydrogen Systems and Demand Response for Enhanced Integration of RES and EVs in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746543</link><description>Global interest in maximizing the hosting capacity (HC) of renewable energy sources (RES) while avoiding high energy curtailment has lately grown in smart grids (SGs). This trend has been associated with the empowerment of hydrogen systems (HS) and demand response (DR). In this regard, this article proposes a new approach to optimally synergize HS and DR for elevated integration of intermittent RES in SGs. The proposed approach is predicated on a coordinated management scheme for various SG control devices, including: a complete HS (hydrogen tank, water electrolyzer, and fuel cell), hydrogen load DR, RES energy curtailment, DSTATCOM functionality of the RES inverters, storage charging rates, and electrical DR. Additionally, the flexibility of electric vehicles (EVs) with G2V/V2G functionalities has been considered to support RES and HS expansion. The proposed approach is formulated as a multi-objective optimization model that aims to optimize two competing objective functions, i.e., total costs and HC capacity of RESs. The simulation results reveal the superiority of the proposed approach which resulted in a notable HC increase of up to 17.24%, accompanied by a significant cost reduction. The proposed approach is also applied to define the optimal number of HS to maximize RES capacity.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Coordinated Automatic Generation Control Involving Distributed Energy Resources: An Aggregation Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746554</link><description>The distributed energy resources (DERs) need to provide ancillary services due to their increasing penetration level in distribution networks (DNs). This paper proposes a hierarchically coordinated automatic generation control (AGC) scheme for the multi-level power grids, to facilitate the DERs to provide AGC service, while ensuring the operational security of the host DNs. Each DN is formulated as an individual AGC participating entity to reduce the computational and communication burden of the transmission system operator (TSO). The distribution system operator (DSO) aggregates its managed DER clusters as a whole, and evaluates the equivalent aggregation dynamic model as well as the regulation capacity. The regulation capacity is evaluated using an optimization program that consider device and network constraints, and prediction uncertainties. The aggregation dynamic model is estimated based on the curve-fitting, which represents the external power response characteristics of the DN as a second-order state-space model. In addition, P-Q affine regulation strategy is employed to coordinate frequency and voltage control. The active and reactive power commands are simultaneously allocated to DER clusters to eliminate voltage violations arising from providing AGC services. Case studies conducted on a multi-level power grid verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Attack-Resilient Distributed Fixed-Time Consensus Control for HBESSs and Circuit Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772734</link><description>This paper investigates the consensus control problem for heterogeneous battery energy storage systems (HBESSs) with switching topologies. An attack-resilient distributed control scheme is proposed to realize active/reactive power sharing, energy level balancing and frequency/voltage restoration within fixed-time. Rigorous proofs derive the convergence time upper bound for each objective, which is independent on the HBESSs&#8217; initial states and tighter than previous bounds. It is also shown that under bounded actuator attacks, above three control objectives can still be realized in fixed-time. Moreover, analog circuits are firstly constructed to physically implement this new control strategy, which provides a new insight to deploy advanced control schemes on HBESSs. Several simulation examples validate those conclusions from both numerical and circuital perspectives.</description></item><item><title>Near-Optimal Energy Management Strategy for a Grid-Forming PV and Hybrid Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771975</link><description>Integration of Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) into PV plants enables a hybrid PV system with more grid functions like power filtering and frequency regulation. Above that, an energy management system (EMS) plays a key role in achieving grid functions and economic performance. However, previous efforts focused on advanced forecast methods without considering real-time EMS. This paper thus aims to develop a practical real-time EMS with near-optimal performance for the degradation of the hybrid energy storage system (HESS). Firstly, a variational mode decomposition (VMD) method is combined with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to decompose and learn feature parameters of typical historical weather data, improving forecast accuracy and shifting the operation mode periodically. Then, the mixed integer linear programming approach is utilized to find out the optimal control mode in different operation scenarios, and three-segment rules are extracted from the optimization results. Finally, the deep learning-based real-time EMS is developed. Numeric simulations validate that the proposed EMS can achieve near-optimal performance with a low computation burden. Besides, the proposed strategy can reduce the degradation cost by up to 80% compared with competitive rule-based strategies.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Area Architecture for Real-Time Feedback-Based Optimization of Distribution Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819497</link><description>A challenge in transmission-distribution coordination is how to quickly and reliably coordinate Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) across large multi-stakeholder Distribution Networks (DNs) to support the Transmission Network (TN), while ensuring operational constraints continue to be met within the DN. Here we propose a hierarchical feedback-based control architecture for coordination of DERs in DNs, enabling the DN to quickly respond to power set-point requests from the Transmission System Operator (TSO) while maintaining local DN constraints. Our scheme allows for multiple independently-managed areas within the DN to optimize their local resources while coordinating to support the TN, and while maintaining data privacy; the only required inter-area communication is between physically adjacent areas within the DN control hierarchy. We conduct a rigorous stability analysis, establishing intuitive conditions for closed-loop stability, and provide detailed tuning recommendations. The proposal is validated via case studies on multiple feeders, including IEEE-123 and IEEE-8500, using a custom MATLAB&#174;-based application which integrates with OpenDSS&#169;. The simulation results show that the proposed structure is highly scalable and can quickly coordinate DERs in response to TSO commands, while responding to local disturbances within the DN and maintaining DN operational limits.</description></item><item><title>Lyapunov Method-Based Coherent Aggregation of Grid-Forming Converters for Transient Stability Equivalents</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819501</link><description>Paralleled grid-forming converters (GFMs) system suffers from transient instability issues while accurate model is complicated and unsuitable to give stability analysis. Existing aggregation method requires either extensive computation or linearized model assumption to realize coherent identification, which might not distinguish unstable units from stable clusters. In this paper, a two-step algorithm is proposed to realize coherent recognition for multi-GFMs system based on Lyapunov energy function: 1) unstable GFMs are distinguished from stable clusters based on Lyapunov&#8217;s function, 2) stable GFMs are further divided into different clusters using stored potential energy as a criterion. First, large-signal model considering transient interactions and virtual impedance-based fault ride through (VI-FRT) control is derived in transient stability time-scale. Then, Lyapunov energy function (LEF) is constructed for multi-GFMs system taking virtual damping coefficients and voltage dynamics into account. Compared with existing methods, the constructed LEF presents higher stability prediction accuracy and lower computational burden. Moreover, it is found that the relative potential energy among different GFMs can be adopted to identify coherent clusters, which is proved to be mathematically equivalent to coherency recognition using power angle deviation as the indicator. Finally, parameters aggregation is realized using the concept of center of inertia (COI). Based on the proposed method, equivalent reduced model has good accuracy in transient stability prediction compared with full-order model. Both numerical simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments are provided to validate the feasibility of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Equitable Active-Reactive Power Envelopes for Distributed Energy Resources in Power Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829662</link><description>The operating envelope (OE) provides an effective method to manage distributed energy resources (DERs) in power distribution systems (DSs) by offering allowable regions of nodal power injections. The active-reactive power envelope (P-Q envelope) is a desirable type of OE that would increase the allowable active power range and release the reactive power flexibility. However, existing OE studies have not established P-Q envelopes with guaranteed equitableness. This paper proposes an equitable P-Q envelope calculation and optimization method. First, we model the P-Q envelopes as convex polygons on active-reactive power planes of nodal power injections. Second, we define the proportional equitableness of P-Q envelopes and establish two equitable conditions, under which the equitableness of P-Q envelopes is proved mathematically. Third, we propose the P-Q envelope calculation method. Specifically, the P-Q envelopes are initially established considering the security constraints of DSs and then modified by a geometric method to satisfy two equitable conditions. Finally, we develop the optimization method to increase the maximum active power export and import provided by P-Q envelopes by coordinating the on-load tap changer, capacitor banks, and distributed generators. The proposed methods are tested on the 33-bus, real-world 135-bus and 455-bus DSs. Numerical results show that the proposed method efficiently obtains the P-Q envelopes with strict proportional equitableness and remarkably enlarges the size of P-Q envelopes by optimizing the control strategies of DS devices. Compared with existing OE calculation methods, the proposed method obtains the largest allowable power range using the shortest computation time.</description></item><item><title>Coordination of Multi-Agent Orderly Charging via an Incentive-Compatible Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750297</link><description>As the cyber-physical system is developed into cyber-physical-social system, the importance of social factors is growing in the interaction between electric vehicle (EV) and power system. This paper aims to develop an incentive-compatible mechanism to coordinate multi-agent orderly charging. Firstly, the travel behaviors of EV cluster are simulated based on Monte Carlo sampling, and the load transfer model considering various social factors is constructed. Then, an orderly charging mechanism involving multiple agents based on Nash bargaining theory is proposed. In the first stage, the total profit of electric vehicle user, power grid company (PGC), and charge station operator is maximized. In the second stage, the revenue of each agent after participating in the cooperation is improved by transfer payment. Next, the carbon trading mechanism is applied in the incentive compatibility model, and the revenue of PGC participating in the carbon market under different scenarios and constraints are calculated. Finally, by comparing with the existing model, the simulation results show that the proposed multi-agent coordinated orderly charging model can reduce the pressure on the power grid caused by the randomness of EV travel, and through a fair profit distribution mechanism, it can maximize the social benefits of the coalition while increasing the revenue of each agent.</description></item><item><title>Joint Energy-Computation Management for Electric Vehicles Under Coordination of Power Distribution Networks and Computing Power Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753461</link><description>This paper explores the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into the power distribution network (PDN) and computing power network (CPN), leveraging EVs&#8217; inherent energy storage and computing resources. A conceptual hub called a charging and computing station (CCS) is introduced, enabling parked EVs to interact with the PDN and CPN simultaneously. The CPN is composed of the EVs and edge servers, whose computing resources are collectively utilized for processing computation tasks from various applications. The EVs and edge servers in CCSs consume energy at different nodes of the PDN. A two-stage framework is proposed for joint energy and computation management in the EV-PDN-CPN coordination. In Stage 1, a day-ahead system cost minimization problem is formulated with decisions on EV charging/discharging energy scheduling and computation task reallocation among edge servers. A fast algorithm based on the convex-concave procedure is developed to solve the Stage-1 problem whose nonconvexity stems from network constraints of both the PDN and CPN. In Stage 2, EV computing resources are utilized to achieve real-time task offloading, coping with the prediction errors of computation tasks in Stage 1 and minimizing the use of extra energy and computing resources. A linear search algorithm is proposed to solve the nonconvex Stage-2 problem. Results show that the proposed algorithms are more computationally efficient than off-the-shelf solvers, and the proposed EV-PDN-CPN coordination model can save 4.7% and 91.9% of costs in the two stages, respectively, compared to uncoordinated models.</description></item><item><title>Consensus Algorithm-Based Two-Stage Frequency Regulation Strategy With EVs Participating as VSMs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771824</link><description>Isolated grids, with large-scale intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs), face more severe frequency stability issues. Fortunately, grid-connected electric vehicles (EVs) present an opportunity to provide frequency services. In this paper, a two-stage frequency regulation strategy, in which EVs participate in the form of a virtual synchronous machine (VSM), is proposed. First, a frequency response (FR) model is established for both charging stations (CSs) and battery swapping stations (BSSs) using VSM control. On this basis, a two-stage strategy is proposed to consider both frequency regulation performance and system economy. Specifically, in the day-ahead stage (DAS), a multi-unit economic dispatch (ED) model is designed to formulate the operation plan; in the real-time stage (RTS), a consensus-based power allocation strategy is designed for multi-units, responsive to real-time market prices. Case studies involving real-world data of load, RES, and CS illustrate the key benefits of the proposed method, including (i) decreasing frequency deviation, (ii) providing extra rotational inertia, and (iii) reducing dispatch costs.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Aware Scheduling and Control of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations for Dispatching Active Distribution Networks: Theory and Experimental Validation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829625</link><description>This paper proposes and experimentally validates a grid-aware scheduling and control framework for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) for dispatching the operation of active distribution networks (ADNs). The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage (day-ahead), we determine an optimal 24-hour power schedule at the grid connection point (GCP), referred to as the dispatch plan. Then, in the second stage, a real-time model predictive control (RT-MPC) is proposed to track the day-ahead dispatch plan using flexibility from EVCSs and other controllable resources (e.g., batteries). The dispatch plan accounts for the uncertainties of vehicles connected to the EVCS along with other uncontrollable power injections, by day-ahead predicted scenarios. The RT-MPC accounts for the uncertainty of the power injections of stochastic resources (such as demand and generation from photovoltaic &#8211; PV plants) by short-term forecasts. The framework ensures that the grid is operated within its nodal voltage and branches power-flow operational bounds, modeled by a linearized optimal power-flow model, maintaining the tractability of the problem formulation. The scheme is numerically and experimentally validated on a real-life ADN at the EPFL hosting two controllable EVCSs (172 kWp and 32 kWp), multiple PV plants (aggregated generation of 42 kWp), uncontrollable demand from office buildings (20 kWp), and two controllable BESSs (150kW/300kWh and 25kW/25kWh).</description></item><item><title>Peer-to-Peer Multi-Energy Trading Among Heterogeneous Building Prosumers via Asynchronous Distributed Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10877846</link><description>Smart buildings in the integrated community energy system (ICES) are normally equipped with distributed energy resources (DERs), thereby creating building prosumers with both energy production and consumption. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading among building prosumers can bring higher economic benefits for them. Therefore, a P2P multi-energy trading scheme among building prosumers is proposed, which fully explores the flexibility of buildings&#8217; heating loads based on the thermal dynamics of buildings with different thermal insulation properties. Each building prosumer is heterogeneous in terms of its computation and communication infrastructures. This results in a heavy computation burden with the traditional centralized method. To improve the computational efficiency for P2P trading among heterogeneous building prosumers, an asynchronous distributed algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to enable each prosumer to trade energy asynchronously instead of waiting for the trading information from others with poor infrastructure. This asynchronous procedure integrated with the prediction and anomaly detection steps can further accelerate the convergence speed of P2P trading. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed trading scheme and the feasibility and solution optimality of the proposed algorithm.</description></item><item><title>A Joint Power and Renewable Energy Certificate Trading Method in the Peer-to-Peer Market</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777014</link><description>A novel peer-to-peer joint power &amp; renewable energy certificate trading method is proposed to reflect the power &amp; environment values of renewable power simultaneously, as well as promote the on-site utilization. Firstly, the P2P power trading and Renewable Energy Certificate (REC) trading market models are proposed respectively considering their coupling relationships. Secondly, the P2P joint power and REC trading market model is formulated as a centralized optimization problem from the perspective of social welfare maximization in the distribution network level. Thirdly, the centralized optimization model is decomposed into local optimization problems and a distributed interactive algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers is proposed to clear the joint power and REC market, as well as protect the privacy of each participant. Lastly, case studies are performed on the modified IEEE 15-node and 69-node distribution networks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, in terms of improvement of social welfare, promotion of renewable power local consumption, and environmental value expression of renewable power.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Level Frequency Control, Resilience Enhancement and Cyber-Attack Identification in Multi-Area LCC-HVDC Interconnected Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745279</link><description>The utilization of LCC-HVDC lines is one of the methods for transferring bulk-scale power and interconnecting systems with different frequencies. Various control methods have been previously proposed to manage and control LCC-HVDC systems, but none have provided a multi-level control system capable of operating in multiple areas simultaneously. This article presents a comprehensive and multi-task control system for wide-area HVDC systems. In the proposed control systems, multi-level frequency control is conducted in multi-area LCC-HVDC interconnected grids. Additionally, various control strategies are implemented to enhance the network&#8217;s resilience during three-phase fault conditions. Furthermore, the proposed control system can detect and distinguish intelligent false data injection (FDI) cyber-attacks. Nonlinear time domain simulations conducted in MATLAB/SIMULINK demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively balance the frequency of weaker areas, enhance network resilience in critical conditions, and identify FDI cyber-attacks.</description></item><item><title>Detection-Triggered Recursive Impact Mitigation Against Secondary False Data Injection Attacks in Cyber-Physical Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746504</link><description>The cybersecurity of microgrid has received widespread attentions due to the frequently reported attack accidents against distributed energy resource (DER) manufactures. Numerous impact mitigation schemes have been proposed to reduce or eliminate the impacts of false data injection attacks (FDIAs). Nevertheless, the existing methods either requires at least one neighboring trustworthy agent or may bring in unacceptable cost burdens. This paper aims to propose a detection-triggered recursive impact mitigation scheme that can timely and precisely counter the secondary FDIAs (SFDIAs) against the communication links among DERs. Once triggering attack alarms, the power line current readings will be utilised to observe the voltage bias injections through the physical interconnections among DERs, based on which the current bias injections can be recursively reconstructed from the residuals generated by unknown input observers (UIOs). The attack impacts are eliminated by subtracting the reconstructed bias from the incoming compromised data. The proposed mitigation method can work even in the worst case where all communication links are under SFDIAs and only require extra current sensors. The bias reconstruction performance under initial errors and system noises is theoretically analysed and the reconstruction error is proved to be bounded regardless of the electrical parameters. To avoid deploying current sensors on all power lines, a cost-effective deployment strategy is presented to secure a spanning tree set of communication links that can guarantee the secondary control performance. Extensive validation studies are conducted in MATLAB/Simulink and cyber-physical microgrid testbeds to validate the proposed method&#8217;s effectiveness against single/multiple and continuous/discrete SFDIAs.</description></item><item><title>Consecutive Load Redistribution Attack Without Line Admittance Information</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10756615</link><description>This paper develops a novel method for launching a stealthy Load Redistribution Attack (LRA) without requiring knowledge of the power network&#8217;s admittance matrix. Initially, equations involving the admittance matrix in the conventional LRA model are substituted with equivalent conditions utilizing the Power Transfer Distribution Factor (PTDF) matrix. Subsequently, a ridge regression approach is applied to estimate the PTDF matrix based on the hijacked Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data. To maximize the damage inflicted by the proposed LRA, a consecutively small-scale attack strategy is designed to gather more informative data, and the PTDF matrix estimation is then updated accordingly to enhance its accuracy. Ultimately, a stealthy LRA is completed using the final PTDF matrix estimation. The rationale behind employing the PTDF matrix estimation in the proposed method, as opposed to the estimation of the admittance matrix, is that the latter requires information on bus voltage phase angles not supplied by the SCADA system. Simulations on the IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus system, without admittance information for grid transmission lines, demonstrate the accuracy and efficacy of the proposed attack.</description></item><item><title>Infinitesimal-Attack-High-Impact Phenomena: Cyber-Attack Bifurcation in Two-Terminal HVDC Power Delivery Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772379</link><description>Voltage-source converters (VSC) and current-source converters (CSC) are two predominant techniques in high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) power delivery systems. They are crucial for inter-regional power exchange. The cyber vulnerabilities of HVDC systems have been physically demonstrated, threatening their secure operation. To this end, this study investigates the closed-form bifurcation hyperplanes in the cyber-attack injection space of both the VSC HVDC system and the CSC HVDC system. By considering the inherent nonlinearity in intra-station switching control and inter-station coordination control, this study formulates different clusters of attack-induced equilibrium points in HVDC systems. Closed-form sufficient conditions are then derived for triggering small-attack-high-impact and even infinitesimal-attack-high-impact phenomena, in which an infinitesimal cyber-attack can activate rapid power reversal by altering the DC current polarity in VSC HVDC systems or DC voltage polarity in CSC HVDC systems. These attack-induced properties are experimentally validated by establishing a hardware-in-the-loop HVDC cybersecurity testbed, incorporating a Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) and a STM32F429-based cyber-attack prototype. The video demonstration and the first-of-its-kind open-source HVDC cybersecurity testbed are attached.</description></item><item><title>LPPMM-DA: Lightweight Privacy-Preserving Multi-Dimensional and Multi-Subset Data Aggregation for Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10776781</link><description>The smart grid facilitates data centers in collecting real-time power consumption data from users, which is essential for effective power management. Such real-time data may inadvertently disclose the identities and activities of power users. Data aggregation has been identified as a viable solution to this challenge, enabling data centers to obtain only the aggregate power consumption data without accessing individual user information. However, most existing aggregation methodologies are limited to multi-dimensional data aggregation and fail to ensure user privacy, data integrity, and authentication. In this study, we propose a ring signature based multi-dimensional and multi-subset aggregation (LPPMM-DA) scheme. This proposed method allows the data center to compute both the total power consumption and the number of users within each subset across various dimensions. Based on the hardness assumption of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), the ring signature utilized in our scheme is demonstrably unforgeable against adaptive chosen message attacks within the random oracle model. A comprehensive analysis indicates that the proposed scheme meets the security requirements for data aggregation in the smart grid context. Furthermore, performance evaluations reveal that the implementation of this scheme results in lower computational and communication overhead compared to existing related approaches.</description></item><item><title>Securing FACTS-Based Wide Area Damping Controllers Using Modified Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772252</link><description>The performance of wide-area damping controllers (WADCs) heavily depends on the accuracy and authenticity of the measurements received from phasor measurement units (PMUs). These controllers receive PMU data and send the control commands back to grid actuators, e.g., flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices. The use of cyber systems required for transferring PMU measurements, however, makes the controller and entire power system prone to a variety of cyber attacks, e.g., false data injection attacks (FDIAs). On this basis, this paper (i) proposes an FDIA model against FACTS-based WADCs and (ii) develops detection and mitigation methods for the proposed attacks. First, FDIAs are designed to destabilize the system, considering realistic limitations on the power grids. Then, a modified conditional generative adversarial network (MCGAN) is utilized for the detection and mitigation of these FDIAs. To detect this attack, a detector is developed from the discriminator of MCGAN, using the fine-tuning technique. The use of this proposed method enhances detection performance in imbalanced datasets and effectively identifies unseen high-risk attacks. Following the detection, a mitigation method is implemented based on the coordination of a graph-based interpolation and the tuned generator of the developed MCGAN. This method effectively mitigates the impact of the FDIAs on the FACTS-based WADCs. The effectiveness of the attack model, as well as the detection and mitigation methods, is assessed using the two-area Kundur and New England 39-Bus test systems.</description></item><item><title>Power Distribution Network Topology Detection Using Dual-Graph Structure Graph Neural Network Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10779459</link><description>Topology detection (TD) in the context of power distribution networks (PDNs) is a fundamental requirement for a wide range of applications, such as fault localization and load management. PDNs suffer from a lack of real-time topological information due to insufficient data on switch statuses and an increasing number of switching actions caused by reconfigurations and the control of distributed energy resources (DERs). On this basis, in this paper, a novel near real-time TD method for PDNs is proposed. This method is built on a specialized graph neural network (GNN) design using data from micro-phasor measurement units ( $\mu $ PMUs), leveraging the strengths of both graph-based learning and conventional deep learning (DL) approaches. More specifically, the developed TD method implements a novel dual-graph structure GNN (DGS-GNN) model to transform the TD problem into an inductive link prediction task for a multi-graph dataset. During the training phase, a node attribute similarity graph is created, and the resulting node embeddings are aligned with the actual topology graph (ATG) using a structure-aware loss function. In the inference phase, however, unlike standard GNN models that require structural information as input, the ATG is recovered based solely on node attributes. The developed method enables TD using a limited number of phasor measurements with low inference time and superior generalization capability for unseen scenarios. Its strong performance in large-scale PDNs with varying configurations, as well as its robustness to uncertainties from DERs and noisy environments, is demonstrated on the IEEE 33- and 123-Bus benchmarks and a standard 240-Bus test system. The proposed method outperforms its DL-based counterparts in scenarios where full or partial system topology should be detected.</description></item><item><title>Detection of FDIA in Power Grid Based on Hypergraph and Attention Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819489</link><description>False data injection attack (FDIA) is posing a threat to the security of power grids. Detection technology is an effective means to defend against FDIA, but the existing mainstream methods have insufficient detection capabilities for large-scale power grids. This study proposes a novel method that combines subgraph partitioning strategy and hypergraph model to detect FDIA. According to the principle the attack principle, the power grid is partitioned into subgraphs. Each subgraph is constructed as the hypergraph and then input into the hypergraph convolutional neural network (HGCNN). The hypergraph attention mechanism (HGAT) is adopted to pay attention to the hyperedge, where the attention score is calculated through the similarity between the node and the hyperedge. Simulations were conducted on IEEE 14-, 118-, and 300-bus systems. At the 10% attack intensity, the proposed method achieved 1.62%, 2.05%, and 2.18% higher accuracy than the optimal results of the comparison methods on three test systems, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Fostering Trust in Smart Inverters: A Framework for Firmware Update Management and Tracking in VPP Context</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829643</link><description>Ensuring the reliability and security of smart inverters that provide the interface between distributed energy resources (DERs) and the power grid becomes paramount with the surge in integrating DERs into the (smart) power grid.

This paper introduces a novel framework to manage and track firmware update history, leveraging verifiable credentials. By tracking the update history and implementing a trust cycle based on these verifiable updates, we aim to improve grid resilience, enhance cybersecurity, and increase transparency for stakeholders.</description></item><item><title>Toward Value-Oriented Renewable Energy Forecasting: An Iterative Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771620</link><description>Energy forecasting is an essential task in power system operations. Operators usually issue forecasts and use them to schedule energy dispatch in advance. However, forecasting models are typically developed in a way that overlooks the decision value of forecasts. To bridge the gap, we design a value-oriented point forecasting approach for sequential energy dispatch problems with renewable energy sources. At the training phase, we align the training objective with the decision value, i.e., minimizing the overall operating cost. The forecasting model parameter estimation is formulated as a bilevel program. Under mild assumptions, we convert the upper-level objective into an equivalent form using the dual solutions obtained from the lower-level operation problems. In addition, a novel iterative solution strategy is proposed for the newly formulated bilevel program. Under such an iterative scheme, we show that the upper-level objective is locally linear with respect to the forecasting model output and can act as the loss function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared to commonly used forecasts predicting expected realization, forecasts obtained by the proposed approach result in lower operating costs. Meanwhile, the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to that of two-stage stochastic programs, but is more computationally efficient.</description></item><item><title>On the Solution Uniqueness of Data-Driven Modeling of Flexible Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10803001</link><description>This letter first explores the solution uniqueness of the data-driven modeling of price-responsive flexible loads (PFL).

However, how to flexibly allocate computing tasks within vehicles and efficiently manage the resources consumed by tasks has emerged as a challenge. To tackle this issue, this research advances the proposition of employing an auxiliary vehicle (AV) for task offloading and introduces a novel Auxiliary Vehicle Algorithm (AVA). AVA integrates both federated learning and multi-agent reinforcement learning to fully utilize computing resources in the vehicular environment, and simultaneously achieves task delay reduction, energy consumption minimization, and task completion rate augmentation. Moreover, we establish a federated learning framework to judiciously determine the proportion of resource allocation of AV through the implementation of inventive mechanisms. Experiment results validate that our approach not only leads to the improvement of key system performance indicators, but also ensures the comprehensive exploitation of the computing resources of mobile vehicles.</description></item><item><title>Integration of LLM and Human&#8211;AI Coordination for Power Dispatching With Connected Electric Vehicles Under SAGVNs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10720517</link><description>Advanced artificial intelligence (AI) solutions deployed in the environment of space-air-ground integrated vehicular networks (SAGVNs) are instrumental in achieving efficient coordination between connected electric vehicles (EVs) and distributed networks. This study addresses this challenge by leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) based hybrid dispatching framework for formulating dispatching strategies, where the need for commonsense understanding by EV drivers is paramount. This paper proposes a framework LLM-D3PG, LLM-guided dual Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient, which empowers EV drivers to articulate their expectations for AI-generated dispatching strategies using natural language instructions. These instructions serve as guidance for the generation of dispatching strategies within complex distributed network scenarios. According to this strategy, the proposed framework seamlessly integrates the decision-making capabilities of LLM with multiple D3PG models to generate a large number of candidate dispatching strategies and then uses the whale optimization algorithm to optimize these strategies to achieve better dispatching results. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and show outperformance in comparison to some existing methods for power dispatching tasks with the random connection of EVs in SAGVNs.</description></item><item><title>Wireless Channel Measurements and Characterization in Industrial IoT Scenarios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10716793</link><description>Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) communication technologies hold significant potential for realizing the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). In this paper, both Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) and polarized Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channel measurements are conducted in an IIoT scenario at the less congested Wi-Fi band, i.e., 5.5 GHz. The purpose is to investigate wireless characteristics of communications between access points and terminals mounted on automated guided vehicles as well as those surrounding manufacturing areas. For SISO channel measurements, statistical properties including the delay Power Spectral Density (PSD), path loss, shadowing fading, delay spread, excess delay, K-factor, and amplitude distribution of small-scale fading are analyzed and compared with those observed in an office scenario. For MIMO channel measurements, results show that there are multiple Dense Multipath Component (DMC) processes in the delay PSD. An estimation algorithm based on the algorithm for a single DMC process is proposed to effectively process the multi-processes data. Moreover, delay, angular, power, and polarization properties of DMCs are investigated and compared with those of specular multipath components. Furthermore, effects of DMCs on Singular Values (SVs) and channel capacities are explored. Ignoring DMCs can overestimate SVs and underestimate channel capacities.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Train Eco-Driving and Safety-Tracking Cooperative Optimization by Nonlinear Programming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10711207</link><description>Eco-driving and safety-tracking are two main topics in multi-train operations.

This paper integrates the two topics and proposes a general cooperation method for multi-train operation in urban rail transit system. The cooperative operation problem is formulated as an optimal control problem and then solved as a nonlinear program (NLP). By treating catenary voltages as control variables, we show that the dynamic electric power flow for the typical double-track DC railway system can be considered within the NLP, with no need to develop a complex power flow calculation for the coupled circuits. Compared to existing works, the proposed method achieves true cooperation among trains by minimizing the global substation energy usage, while ensuring dynamic safety-tracking distances among adjacent trains.</description></item><item><title>Finite Control Set Model Predictive Current Control (FCS-MPCC) of Three-Port Converter for Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715593</link><description>Fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCEVs) are considered an appealing option for heavy-duty and long-distance vehicles. However, they require the use of multiple power converters to manage power distribution among the fuel cell, battery or ultracapacitor, and AC motor, leading to increased power losses and a more complex system. To overcome this challenge, multi-port power converters have been proposed to combine two power sources and the AC motor into one conversion stage, boosting overall efficiency and power density in hybrid powertrains. However, these converters still rely on a high number of semiconductors and involve complex control systems. This paper introduces a three-port converter (TPC) for FCHEVs, using only one power stage with 6 semiconductors, achieving high performance control of an ac motor, a fuel cell and a battery. A multivariable optimal control (Finite-Control-Set Model Predictive Current Control) manages the power flows between the energy sources and drives the motor simultaneously. Additionally, the performance of the multiport converter is improved by replacing its three inductors with a custom coupled inductor designed to reduce circulating AC currents. This innovation contributes to improved efficiency and overall functionality of the FCHEV system. The proposed system was validated through an 0.5kW experimental test bench and simulations of an urban driving cycle. The system controlled the multiple variables of the hybrid system with proper operation and fast dynamics, meanwhile the coupled inductor decreases the current magnitude in 20$\%$ compared to the non-coupled configuration.</description></item><item><title>Cell-Free Processing for 5G Massive MIMO Deployments: Sleep Modes and User Stream Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10713293</link><description>Cell-free massive MIMO (CF-M-MIMO) is heralded as a technological pillar for 6G mobile networks, outperforming the classical cellular-based M-MIMO architecture of 5G by bringing infrastructure closer to end users and leveraging interference cancellation through network-wide joint processing. However, the major drawback is the significant expense required to deploy and maintain numerous infrastructure sites and connect them to a central processing unit (CPU) for baseband processing. This paper proposes utilizing CF-M-MIMO processing atop existing micro/macrocellular deployments in current 5G networks. It suggests connecting all base stations (BSs) to a CPU via fronthaul links to enable joint processing of user equipment (UE) without the costly deployment of many scattered access points (APs). By jointly managing all transmit/receive points (TRPs) in the network, a novel switch on/off strategy is derived to maximize energy efficiency by exploiting the sleep mode capabilities of current baseband/RF hardware, adapting to changes in UE behavior and operator requirements. Additionally, the paper considers multiantenna user terminals, common in current 5G setups, and proposes a technique to manage the number of streams directed to each UE, balancing multiplexing gains and increased pilot contamination.</description></item><item><title>Joint User Scheduling, Power Allocation, and Trajectory Design for Joint Synthetic Aperture Radar and Communication UAV Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715676</link><description>Due to the highly controllable mobility, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are able to simultaneously provide efficient communication and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) based high-precision sensing.

Two problems, i.e. maximization of minimum user throughput and maximization of sum throughput, are investigated under transmit power, UAV mobility, and SAR-based sensing constraints. We propose two joint user scheduling, power allocation and trajectory design (JUPT) algorithms for solving the non-convex problems via alternating optimization. In particular, to execute power allocation more efficiently, two bi-section searching methods are proposed based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. Simulation results validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms by illustrating the convergence behavior. The impacts of various factors on sum/minimum user throughput have been investigated, and distinct user scheduling and power allocation results for the two cases are provided.</description></item><item><title>Energy Efficient Optimal User Association and Node Placement Mechanism for Cooperative UAV Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715701</link><description>To realize energy efficient communication coverage enhancement for cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) communications equipped with multi-beam array antennas, a nested multi-objective mixed integer non-convex model is established to determine the optimal association between user sets and UAV beams as well as the optimal position of UAVs, to minimize the number and total power consumption of UAVs while achieving load balance among UAVs. An alternate joint optimization algorithm that decouples the aforementioned optimization problem to inner and outer layer optimization is proposed. The inner layer alternately optimizes the user association, power consumption and node position of UAVs, while the outer layer optimizes the number of UAVs. Numerical results show that: cooperative UAV communications with multi-beam association and the proposed joint optimization algorithm can flexibly adapt to the demand distribution of complex traffic tasks, reduce total power consumption and achieve load balance among UAVs. These works provide good reference to enhance communication efficiency of cooperative UAV communications.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Resource Allocation for Integrated Sensing and Communications in Internet of Vehicles: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10716739</link><description>Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) technology is identified as a breakthrough in optimizing resource allocation and pursuing mutual benefits between radar sensing and wireless communications. In the complex Internet of Vehicles, however, the rapid increase in vehicles leads to a severe scarcity of spectrum resources that is fundamental for wireless communications. To fully exploit ISAC technology potential under strict resource constraints, this paper develops a joint channel, power, and bandwidth allocation scheme based on deep reinforcement learning to improve resource allocation efficiency. Firstly, a deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm is designed to ensure communication reliability by dynamically allocating wireless channels and transmitting power to vehicles based on their geographic positions. Then, we exploit a deep Q-network algorithm to maximize the communication rates by flexibly allocating frequency bandwidth. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits higher spectral efficiency and communication rates than benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>Energy Efficient Defense Against Cooperative Hostile Detection and Eavesdropping Attacks for AAV-Aided Short-Packet Transmissions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10721449</link><description>Autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV)-aided short-packet transmissions have emerged as a promising paradigm for supporting mission-critical applications in future mobile communication networks. However, the security issues raised by the open nature of the wireless transmission deserve attention, especially when confronted with cooperative wardens and eavesdroppers. To this end, we consider a new framework for an energy-efficient design of AAV-aided short-packet transmission systems against cooperative hostile detection and eavesdropping attacks. Specifically, the false rate of the cooperative hostile detection is first derived by utilizing the likelihood ratio test and the bivariate Gaussian distribution property. Then, we formulate a problem to maximize the minimum covert secrecy energy efficiency (MCSEE) by jointly optimizing the user association, AAV power control, and AAV three-dimensional (3D) trajectory design. We propose a penalty-based dual-loop iterative optimization algorithm to tackle this complex problem suboptimally with the aid of auxiliary penalty variables, where the communication resource scheduling, the AAV trajectory planning, and the auxiliary penalty variables are optimized in the inner loop. In particular, the intractable joint AAV power control and 3D trajectory design sub-problem is suboptimally addressed by introducing slack variables and employing successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. The penalty factor is updated in the outer loop. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed solution to several benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Matching-Driven Deep Reinforcement Learning for Energy-Efficient Transmission Parameter Allocation in Multi-Gateway LoRa Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10714357</link><description>Long-range (LoRa) communication technology, distinguished by its low power consumption and long communication range, is widely used in the Internet of Things. However, the LoRa MAC layer adopts pure ALOHA for medium access control, which may lead to severe packet collisions as the network scale expands, consequently reducing the system energy efficiency (EE). To address this issue, it is critical to carefully allocate transmission parameters such as the channel (CH), transmission power (TP) and spreading factor (SF) to each end device (ED). Owing to the low duty cycle and sporadic traffic of LoRa networks, evaluating the system EE under various parameter settings proves to be time-consuming. Therefore, we propose an analytical model to calculate the system EE while fully considering the impacts of multiple gateways, duty cycling, quasi-orthogonal SFs and capture effects. On this basis, we investigate a joint CH, SF and TP allocation problem with the objective of optimizing the system EE for uplink transmissions. Due to the NP-hard complexity of this optimization problem, it is decomposed into two subproblems: CH assignment and SF/TP assignment. First, a matching-based algorithm is introduced to address the CH assignment subproblem. Then, an attention-based multiagent reinforcement learning technique is employed to address the SF/TP assignment subproblem for EDs allocated to the same CH, which reduces the number of learning agents to achieve fast convergence. The simulation outcomes indicate that the proposed approach converges quickly under various parameter settings and obtains significantly better system EE than the baseline algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Total Computational Bits Maximization for STAR-RIS Aided Wireless Power Transfer Mobile Edge Computing Networks: TDMA or NOMA?</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10720523</link><description>Due to the limited battery capacity and computational power of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, emerging IoT applications depend on mobile edge computing (MEC) networks for computational offloading and wireless power transfer (WPT) to sustain energy levels, with transfer performance influenced by the propagation environment and transmission strategies. Compared to the traditional reflecting-only reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR)-RIS extends coverage from half-space to full-space, significantly enhancing transferring efficiency. This paper compares the performance of three different uplink transmission schemes on a STAR-RIS WPT MEC network. On this basis, for each scenario, a non-convex optimization problem is formulated to maximize the total computational bits for the system, where energy transfer, local processing, uplink transmission allocated resources, and phase shift vectors of STAR-RIS are jointly optimized. To address the non-convexity, each scenario is decoupled into two main subproblems: phase shift vectors of STAR-RIS optimization and joint power, time, and computing frequency optimization. While a closed-form expression is derived to optimize the phase shift vector of STAR-RIS in time division multiple access (TDMA), semi-definite relaxation is employed to optimize the phase shift vectors under Hybrid TDMA-non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and NOMA. Furthermore, block coordinate descent is employed to address the remaining resources. Simulation results indicate the superiority of the proposed scheme for all scenarios in terms of total computational bits compared to benchmark schemes. Moreover, among the three uplink transmission schemes, TDMA performs the best in total computational bits and user fairness owing to its ability to flexibly adapt STAR-RIS phase shift vectors.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Constrained Satellite Edge Computing for Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10721283</link><description>Satellite edge computing (SEC) has emerged as an innovative paradigm for future satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), expanding computation services by sinking computing capabilities into Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellites. However, the mobility of LEO satellites poses two key challenges to SEC: 1) constrained onboard computing and transmission capabilities caused by limited and dynamic energy supply, and 2) stochastic task arrivals within the satellites' coverage and time-varying channel conditions. To tackle these issues, it is imperative to design an optimal SEC offloading strategy that effectively exploits the available energy of LEO satellites to fulfill competing task demands for SEC. In this paper, we propose a dynamic offloading strategy (DOS) with the aim to minimize the overall completion time of arriving tasks in an SEC-assisted STIN, subject to the long-term energy constraints of the LEO satellite. Leveraging Lyapunov optimization theory, we first convert the original long-term stochastic problem into multiple deterministic one-slot problems parameterized by current system states. Then we use sub-problem decomposition to jointly optimize the task offloading, computing, and communication resource allocation strategies. We theoretically prove that DOS achieves near-optimal performance. Numerical results demonstrate that DOS significantly outperforms the other four baseline approaches in terms of task completion time and dropping rate.</description></item><item><title>Spatial Crowdsourcing-Based Task Allocation for UAV-Assisted Maritime Data Collection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10723215</link><description>Driven by the unceasing development of maritime services, tasks of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted maritime data collection (MDC) are becoming increasingly diverse, complex and personalized. As a result, effective task allocation for MDC is becoming increasingly critical. In this work, integrating the concept of spatial crowdsourcing (SC), we develop an SC-based MDC network model and investigate the task allocation problem for UAV-assisted MDC. In variable maritime service scenarios, tasks are allocated to UAVs based on the spatial and temporal requirements of the tasks, as well as the mobility of the UAVs. To address this problem, we design an SC-based task allocation algorithm for the MDC (SC-MDC-TA). The quality estimation is utilized to assess and regulate task execution quality by evaluating signal to interference plus noise ratio and the UAV energy consumption. The reverse auction is employed to potentially reduce the task waiting time as much as possible while ensuring timely completion. Additionally, we establish typical task allocation scenarios based on maritime service requirements indicated by electronic navigational charts. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SC-MDC-TA algorithm effectively allocates tasks for various MDC scenarios. Furthermore, compared to the benchmark, the SC-MDC-TA algorithm can also reduce the task completion time and lower the UAV energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>Meta-Learning for Graph Neural Network-Based Power Allocation in LEO Satellite Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10713180</link><description>In this work, we develop a power allocation policy for low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications with uneven traffic distribution. The inter-beam interference is one of the bottlenecks for achieving high data rates. To manage interference, we represent the power allocation policy by a graph neural network (GNN) that is scalable to the number of beams of the satellite. The domain knowledge in satellite communications is exploited to design the structure and hyper-parameters of the GNN. To improve the generalization ability of the GNN in scenarios with different traffic distributions, we train the GNN in an unsupervised manner by using meta-learning. The idea is to train the GNN with different traffic distributions and then test it in unseen scenarios. Our simulation results show that the data rate achieved by the GNN-based power allocation policy is 30% higher than existing power allocation policies and is close to the upper bound. The GNN outperforms the fully-connected neural network in terms of scalability. Finally, we demonstrate that with meta-learning, the GNN does not need samples in unseen scenarios to achieve high data rates.</description></item><item><title>How to Design Location Development and Power Allocation for Hybrid RIS Downlink</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10716810</link><description>In this letter, we investigate a multiple active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) and passive RIS (PRIS) coexistence downlink, where the total power constraint is considered including the transmit power at base station (BS) and amplifying power for signal reflection at ARIS. We jointly analyze the location of ARIS and the power allocation in different scenarios. To better clarify the influence of ARIS deployment and power allocation on the achievable capacity, we first derive closed-form expressions. Due to the extremely large computational complexity of global optimization, we further introduce an approved approximation to precisely represent exact solution of ARIS deployment. Moreover, numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategy compared with the conventional global optimization.</description></item><item><title>AIRS-Assisted Vehicular Networks With Rate-Splitting SWIPT Receivers: Joint Trajectory and Communication Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10735148</link><description>In this correspondence, we propose to use an intelligent reflective surface (IRS) installed on autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV), referred to as aerial IRS (AIRS), for vehicular networks, where simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) receivers to concurrently allow information decoding (ID) and energy harvesting (EH) are equipped at the battery-limited vehicles. For efficiently supporting the multiple moving vehicles, we adopt rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) technique. With the aim of maximizing the sum rate of vehicles, we jointly optimize trajectory and phase shift design of AIRS, transmit power and rate allocation for RSMA along with power splitting ratio for SWIPT implementation. Via simulations, the superior performances of the proposed algorithm are validated compared to the conventional partial optimizations.</description></item><item><title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided MIMO Wireless Power Transfer With Multiple Energy Harvesting Requirements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10721438</link><description>In this correspondence, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted wireless power transfer system where a multi-antenna energy station (ES) transmits energy beams to multi-antenna energy receivers (ERs) is considered. We aim at optimizing the ES beamforming and the RIS beamforming to minimize the transmit power of the ES under individual energy harvesting constraints for ERs. To handle the beamforming optimization problem, we develop an algorithm where an alternating direction method of multipliers based scheme is put forward for the RIS beamforming optimization. Compared with the counterpart which relies on semidefinite relaxation to optimize the RIS beamforming, the complexity of the proposed beamforming optimization algorithm is significantly reduced. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed algorithm performs close to the counterpart, which implies that the complexity reduction is achieved at very limited expense of performance.</description></item><item><title>Global Progress Toward Renewable Electricity: Tracking the Role of Solar (Version 4)</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10673798</link><description>Photovoltaics (PV) represented &#8764;61% of newly installed global electricity generating capacity for 2023. The amount of electricity generated by nonhydro renewables (wind, solar, geothermal, and biomass) reached another record high and exceeded generation by global hydropower for the first time in history. Fractional year-to-year growth in both PV installations and PV-generated electricity continued at remarkable levels (&#8764;35% and &#8764;24%, respectively), while grid scale battery storage grew even faster (&#8764;120%). Combined fractional electricity generation from all low carbon sources (hydro, nuclear, and renewables) reached &#8764;39%.

Despite targets to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, fossil fuels still dominate the energy industry systems in the USA and Canada. Transition pathways are developed and analyzed comparing a complete defossilization of both energy and nonenergy demands with business-as-usual conditions based on government projections. The results demonstrate the benefits of transitioning to 100% renewable energy for all sectors, as excess low-cost electricity from solar PV can be used for power-to-X solutions to produce electricity-based fuels, chemicals, and materials. By 2050, the power sector will only consume 20% of generated electricity, with the remaining used to electrify the heat, transport, and industry sectors. Thus, 86% of all primary energy in the system comes from renewable electricity, as total electricity generation increases from 4394 TWh in 2020 to 20 795 TWh in 2050. Solar PV reaches 78% of all electricity generation, leading to 10.6 TW of installed capacity. The full energy industry sector transition leads to reductions in both levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and levelized cost of final energy (LCOFE). The LCOE sees massive reductions from 72 &#8364;/MWh in 2020 to 25 &#8364;/MWh in 2050, and the LCOFE decreases from the current 50 to 41 &#8364;/MWh in 2050. The strong operational synergies between solar PV and flexible electrolysis enable a transition pathway that demonstrates the viability of a Power-to-X Economy in achieving climate targets of net-zero emissions. The high share of solar PV indicates a Solar-to-X Economy characteristic.</description></item><item><title>Development of an Optical Library for Coevaporated CdSexTe1&#8722;x</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777397</link><description>The conversion efficiency of CdTe solar cells may be improved by bandgap engineering, i.e., changing the bandgap value through the addition of Se in the absorber. The Se alloying enables a short-circuit current density improvement, as it leads to a bandgap energy value decrease. Furthermore, it has been associated with increased minority carrier lifetimes, assuring high open-circuit voltage values. An Se gradient profile control can further optimize the solar cell performance. Thus, an optical model baseline of the CdSexTe1&#8722;x (CST) compound was developed. Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements were conducted to accurately extract the optical constants of ten CST layers deposited through coevaporation with x varying from 0 to 1. Using the measured dielectric function spectra from the discrete CST layers with varying x, and considering the composition-induced shift in the critical point energies, an energy-shift model was employed to develop the accurate optical library for the CST compound for any x value to provide data for future modeling and optimization. The library accuracy was validated through optical simulations of the quantum efficiency of a graded CST solar cell using the finite-difference time-domain method by replicating the Se profile in the absorber layer measured through secondary ion mass spectrometry.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Encapsulation Processing Conditions on Degradation Mechanisms of Carbon-Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10876559</link><description>Perovskite photovoltaic (PV) cells have achieved a record 26.7% efficiency, but improvements in stability against humidity, temperature shifts, and light exposure remain crucial. In this work, we explored mesoporous carbon-based perovskite (c-PSC) devices because of carbon's stability and the elimination of a heat-sensitive hole transport layer. Encapsulation materials exhibiting promising properties with silicon PV, including a thermoplastic polyolefin encapsulant, were applied under different lamination conditions to investigate the impact on c-PSC devices&#8217; durability, which is a novel study for this specific combination of materials. Inadequate curing can compromise adhesion, reduce moisture resistance, and accelerate perovskite decomposition under light exposure. Increasing the lamination temperature by 20&#8201;&#176;C allowed samples to withstand 1000 h of damp-heat conditions, with a 30% reduction in efficiency, while lower temperature lamination caused immediate performance drops. While light exposure remained highly degrading, higher lamination temperatures delayed damage, preserving 2.5% of the initial power conversion efficiency after 400 h of aging and slowing perovskite decomposition.</description></item><item><title>A Spot-Area Method to Evaluate the Incidence Angle Modifier of Photovoltaic Devices-Part 2: Modules (Differential Method)</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10835743</link><description>In Part 1 of our article, we presented a method to quantify the incidence angle modifier (IAM) of photovoltaic (PV) devices, which differs from the methods proposed in IEC 61853-2 through the following: it utilizes a spot-area irradiation, delivered by an optical fiber system, a customized angle probe holder, and a current-to-voltage converter. Part 1 focused on single-cell devices and presented the validation of the new method on two different cell architectures. In Part 2, we generalize that method to commercial-size silicon PV modules, mirroring by the approach already used for module-level spectral responsivity measurements described in IEC 60904-8:2014. The proposed method is motivated by inclusion in the currently ongoing revision of IEC 61853-2, providing research centers and testing laboratories with an additional option to perform IAM measurements indoors. The reproducibility of the proposed method is addressed in this work via interlaboratory comparison with a different measurement method for the same quantity and with a detailed uncertainty analysis.</description></item><item><title>Effect of Encapsulant Degradation on Photovoltaic Modules Performances Installed in Different Climates</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10835212</link><description>A damage analysis was conducted on photovoltaic modules with identical bill of materials exposed to different climates: Cfb moderate and Af tropical, according to the K&#246;ppen-Geiger climate classification. The combination of high temperature, relative humidity, and high ultraviolet (UV) radiation was the cause of severe degradation for the modules exposed to tropical climates (TR), whereas the module exposed to a moderate climate did not experience a significant loss in performance. The modules installed in TR, on the contrary, showed significant power degradation after approximately 8 years of exposure, primarily attributed to acetic acid-related degradation modes. Encapsulant samples were extracted from the selected modules and characterized to determine changes in chemical structure, thermal stability, and consumption of additives and stabilizers. The results of qualitative additive analysis showed that the UV absorber was no longer detectable in the front encapsulant extracted from modules exposed in TR. The consumption of the stabilizers was considered as the main cause of reduction of molar mass. The presence of acetic acid was evident in both electroluminescence images and ion chromatography results. While differential scanning calorimetry successfully detected a reduction in molar mass, thermogravimetric analysis, and infrared spectroscopy proved unsuitable for identifying chain scission phenomena.</description></item><item><title>Growing Panes: Investigating the PV Technology Trends Behind Frequent Early Failures in Modern Glass&#8211;Glass Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10847304</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) module materials and technologies continue to evolve as module manufacturers and buyers try to minimize costs, maximize performance, and speed deployment. Both silicon and thin film modules are converging toward similar &#8764;3 $\text{m}^{2}$ glass&#8211;glass designs with thinner glass sheets to increase power output while reducing module weight, and both types are increasingly mounted on single-axis trackers. At the same time, an increasing number of PV sites have been reporting spontaneous glass breakage in early life systems deployed with these &#8220;big, floppy modules.&#8221; In this article, we identify the concurrent module changes that may be contributing to increased early failure, explain the trends, and discuss their reliability implications. We suggest that larger, thinner glass sheets along with variations in heat treatment and quality may be contributing to glass vulnerability. We note that trends toward weaker or back-mounted frames may also be contributing to module failures, especially for &#8220;extra-extra-large&#8221; modules mounted on trackers. Combinations of these trends may have pushed modules to a threshold at which increasing early failures are causing the front edge of the &#8220;bathtub curve&#8221; to re-emerge. Current qualification testing appears to be ineffective for catching these early failures in new module designs, and module buyers do not have enough reliability information&#8212;or cannot prioritize such information&#8212;during module procurement. Additional research is needed to identify the field conditions leading to glass breakage and if there is one or multiple limiting flaws in new module designs causing glass breakage. Early failures may be mitigated by returning to more robust designs or ensuring better module testing and quality assurance.</description></item><item><title>Investigating the Crosslinking, Degradation, and Adhesion Behavior of Photovoltaic Encapsulants Under Thermal Accelerated Aging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804171</link><description>Degradation of photovoltaic (PV) module encapsulant characteristics that lead to mechanical embrittlement and delamination remains a cause of failure in solar installations. A multiscale reliability model connecting the encapsulant mechanical and fracture properties to the degraded molecular structure and interfacial bonding to adjacent solar cell and glass substrates was previously published. The model, developed primarily for poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) acetate (EVA) encapsulants, remains to be experimentally validated. Determining the degradation and crosslinking kinetics of alternative encapsulants, such as polyolefin elastomer (POE) and EVA/POE/EVA composites (EPE), can generalize the model. In this work, we subject fully cured EVA, POE, and EPE encapsulants to accelerated thermal aging to determine how high temperatures impact reaction kinetics. An increase in gel content (crosslinking) and decrease in crystallinity of the encapsulants under hot-aerobic (90 &#176;C, 22% RH) and hot-anaerobic (90 &#176;C, sealed in N2 air) aging were observed, even in the absence of UV and crosslinking initiators. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)-attenuated total reflectance analysis showed insignificant encapsulant degradation, demonstrating the critical role of UV and moisture in accelerating degradation. Adhesion testing performed on coupon-level specimens (cell/encapsulant/glass laminates) showed decreases in adhesion energy, Gc, from 5000 h of hot-dry (90 &#176;C, &#8764;1% RH) and hot-humid (90 &#176;C, 60% RH) aging. POE coupons demonstrated the best stability, followed by EPE then EVA. For EVA and POE, hot-humid aged coupons experienced a larger decrease in Gc due to enhanced hydrolytic degradation. Hot-dry aging condition demonstrated that thermal degradation of the interface could be significant even if the encapsulant experiences negligible degradation in the absence of UV and elevated humidity.</description></item><item><title>Comparison of Reflector Materials for a Vertical Bifacial Solar Canal</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829584</link><description>In this article, we assessed five reflector materials for hypothetical vertical bifacial arrays as a solar canal technology option. We screened the materials (CoverMax, CoverTuff, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) Poly, polyester canvas, and Vivosun aluminized Mylar) for reflectivity, tensile strength to minimum mounting load, vapor barrier performance to reduce evaporation, and energy production. Vivosun had the highest reflectivity (albedo of 0.87&#8211;0.93) and increased annual energy production more than 40% compared with a system without reflector, but plastically deformed under tensile strength testing. All materials reduced evaporation at least fivefold compared with the control. Following our preliminary assessment, we calculated the levelized cost of electricity of a hypothetical vertical bifacial array with two height configurations (short system at 2 m and tall system at 3 m) and four hybrid reflectors (fabricated from strong base layer materials with a top layer of Vivosun) and compared these results with systems with single-material reflectors and with systems without reflectors. We found that the tall system with a hybrid reflector made from PVC Poly had the lowest levelized cost of electricity. However, when considering other performance metrics, such as tensile strength and vapor barrier performance, a hybrid reflector made from CoverMax emerged as the best candidate of the options considered.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Soiling Estimation and Optimized Cleaning Strategies for Industrial Rooftop PV Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10847915</link><description>The accumulation of dust and dirt on solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, known as soiling, reduces energy generation and conversion efficiency of a PV plant. Therefore, regular cleaning is essential to maintain optimal plant performance and economic viability. Fixed-interval cleaning schedules become uneconomical during periods such as low-insolation, rainy, or cloudy events. This study proposes a data-driven method to estimate the soiling ratio (SR) for a 504-kWp rooftop PV plant in India using power, temperature, and irradiance data. A PV panel temperature estimation model is employed, based on ambient temperature and solar irradiance, which simplifies the process by eliminating the need for direct temperature measurements. The analysis reveals that regular cleaning is essential despite rainfall, with energy losses due to soiling ranging from 32% to 47% across inverters, with soiling rates of 4.6&#8211;5.5% per day. A dynamic cleaning schedule, considering weather and soiling conditions, was developed to reduce these losses. Economic evaluation demonstrated that manual cleaning following the proposed dynamic schedule is cost effective, with profit margins of 48&#8211;77%, comparing energy gain and cleaning cost. Compared with fixed-interval cleaning, the proposed method maintained the same average SR but yielded 25&#8211;49% higher profitability across inverters.</description></item><item><title>A Single Voltage Sensor Bypass Switch-Based Photovoltaic Fault Localization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10877760</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) energy systems are becoming an important source of sustainable energy. However, undiscovered faults within these systems may cause significant efficiency reduction. Localizing these faults to the module level is important for a quick fault diagnosis and maintaining the overall system efficiency. This article presents a novel method to localize intrastring, line-ground, cross-string, and partial shading faults in an $N$ &#215; $M$ PV system down to the module level. The approach utilizes a single voltage sensor in the combiner box of the PV system and $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ bypass switches per string to bypass the connected PV modules during faults. The technique initially relies on identifying the faulty string. Once this string is determined, the voltage associated with each module in that string is found. Each module's voltage in that string is obtained by measuring the string voltage after bypassing each module corresponding to an activated switch. Subsequently, the resulting linear equations are solved to obtain the voltage of each module in the faulty string. The technique is verified using simulation and an experimental setup for a 5 x 4 small-size PV system. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the technique can accurately localize faulty modules with only $N$ voltage samples of the faulty string. The proposed method is robust to variations in the maximum power point tracking algorithm, ensuring faults are localized effectively in real-time.</description></item><item><title>A Compact 0.9&#956; W Direct-Conversion Frequency Analyzer for Speech Recognition With Wide- Range Q-Controllable Bandpass Rectifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10695034</link><description>The development of ultralow-power analog front ends for edge artificial intelligence (AI) is actively pursued; however, these front ends suffer from low-frequency selection accuracy, leading to increased training loads for the AI components and higher testing costs. In this article, we propose a novel circuit that fundamentally addresses these issues through direct conversion. By re-evaluating the circuit configurations of the multiplier, harmonic removal filter, and full-wave rectifier (FWR) from scratch, we have miniaturized and integrated an ultralow-power converter that transforms frequency components into pulse sequences. The frequency to be analyzed is determined by the local frequency input to the multiplier, which can be digitally controlled with high precision. In our system, the Q value is adaptively adjusted by the local frequency of the direct conversion, allowing the same circuit configuration to be applied to all frequency nodes, eliminating the need for filter design for each node and providing a highly design-friendly and scalable frequency analysis system.The test chip was fabricated with a 0.18- $\mu $ m process, operating at a 1.2-V supply, and outputting power pulse streams corresponding to 11 different frequencies ranging from 500 to 5 kHz. The total operating power was  $0.9\mu $ W, with an achieved equivalent Q factor ranging from 3.6 to 36. In a training experiment using a convolutional neural network (CNN) speech recognition model constructed with a functional model equivalent to this front end, a recognition rate exceeding 80% was achieved, demonstrating the practicality of this front end.</description></item><item><title>46-nA High-PSR CMOS Buffered Voltage Reference With 1.2&#8211;5 V and &#8722;40 &#9702;C to 125 &#9702;C Operating Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682102</link><description>A nanopower, buffered CMOS voltage reference designed to operate across the entire industrial temperature range (from  $- 40~^{\circ }$ C to  $125~^{\circ }$ C) and with an input voltage range from 1.2 to 5 V (automotive applications) is presented.

In addition, the circuit occupies a die area of 0.146 mm2 (with the reference circuit alone covering 0.043 mm2) and maintains a highly stable current consumption of around 45 nA across various process and input voltage conditions (25 nA for the reference circuit alone) while providing a maximum output current of  $630~\mu $ A with a load regulation of 0.016 mV/ $\mu $ A.</description></item><item><title>Bandwidth-Latency-Thermal Co-Optimization of Interconnect-Dominated Many-Core 3D-IC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10720515</link><description>The ongoing integration of advanced functionalities in contemporary system-on-chips (SoCs) poses significant challenges related to memory bandwidth, capacity, and thermal stability. These challenges are further amplified with the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), necessitating enhanced memory and interconnect bandwidth and latency. This article presents a comprehensive study encompassing architectural modifications of an interconnect-dominated many-core SoC targeting the significant increase of intermediate, on-chip cache memory bandwidth and access latency tuning. The proposed SoC has been implemented in 3-D using A10 nanosheet technology and early thermal analysis has been performed. Our workload simulations reveal, respectively, up to 12- and 2.5-fold acceleration in the 64-core and 16-core versions of the SoC. Such speed-up comes at 40% increase in die-area and a 60% rise in power dissipation when implemented in 2-D. In contrast, the 3-D counterpart not only minimizes the footprint but also yields 20% power savings, attributable to a 40% reduction in wirelength. The article further highlights the importance of pipeline restructuring to leverage the potential of 3-D technology for achieving lower latency and more efficient memory access. Finally, we discuss the thermal implications of various 3-D partitioning schemes in High Performance Computing (HPC) and mobile applications. Our analysis reveals that, unlike high-power density HPC cases, 3-D mobile case increases  $T_{\max }$  only by  $2~^{\circ } $ C&#8211; $3~^{\circ } $ C compared to 2-D, while the HPC scenario analysis requires multiconstrained efficient partitioning for 3-D implementations.</description></item><item><title>3DNN-Xplorer: A Machine Learning Framework for Design Space Exploration of Heterogeneous 3-D DNN Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715720</link><description>This article presents 3DNN-Xplorer, the first machine learning (ML)-based framework for predicting the performance of heterogeneous 3-D deep neural network (DNN) accelerators. Our ML framework facilitates the design space exploration (DSE) of heterogeneous 3-D accelerators with a two-tier compute-on-memory (CoM) configuration, considering 3-D physical design factors. Our design space encompasses four distinct heterogeneous 3-D integration styles, combining 28- and 16-nm technology nodes for both compute and memory tiers. Using extrapolation techniques with ML models trained on 10-to-256 processing element (PE) accelerator configurations, we estimate the performance of systems featuring 75&#8211;16384 PEs, achieving a maximum absolute error of 13.9% (the number of PEs is not continuous and varies based on the accelerator architecture). To ensure balanced tier areas in the design, our framework assumes the same number of PEs or on-chip memory capacity across the four integration styles, accounting for area imbalance resulting from different technology nodes. Our analysis reveals that the heterogeneous 3-D style with 28-nm compute and 16-nm memory is energy-efficient and offers notable energy savings of up to 50% and an 8.8% reduction in runtime compared to other 3-D integration styles with the same number of PEs. Similarly, the heterogeneous 3-D style with 16-nm compute and 28-nm memory is area-efficient and shows up to 8.3% runtime reduction compared to other 3-D styles with the same on-chip memory capacity.</description></item><item><title>A 578-TOPS/W RRAM-Based Binary Convolutional Neural Network Macro for Tiny AI Edge Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709360</link><description>The novel nonvolatile computing-in-memory (nvCIM) technology enables data to be stored and processed in situ, providing a feasible solution for the widespread deployment of machine learning algorithms in edge AI devices. However, current nvCIM approaches based on weighted current summation face challenges such as device nonidealities and substantial time, storage, and energy overheads when handling high-precision analog signals. To address these issues, we propose a resistive random access memory (RRAM)-based binary convolution macro for constructing a complete binary convolutional neural network (BCNN) hardware circuit, accelerating edge AI applications with low-weight precision. This macro performs error compensation at the circuit level and provides stable rail-to-rail output, eliminating the need for any ADCs or processor to perform auxiliary computations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BCNN full-hardware computing system achieves on-chip recognition accuracy of 90.7% (98.64%) on the CIFAR10 (MNIST) dataset, which represents a decrease of 0.98% (0.59%) compared to software recognition accuracy. In addition, this binary convolution macro achieves a maximum throughput of 320 GOPS and a peak energy efficiency of 578 TOPS/W at 136 MHz.</description></item><item><title>An Interpolation-Free Fractional Motion Estimation Algorithm and Hardware Implementation for VVC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682065</link><description>Versatile video coding (VVC) introduces multi-type tree (MTT) and larger coding tree unit (CTU) to improve compression efficiency compared to its predecessor High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). This leads to higher throughput for fractional motion estimation (FME) to meet the needs of real-time processing. In this context, this article proposes an interpolation-free algorithm based on an error surface to improve the throughput of FME hardware. The error surface is constructed by the rate-distortion costs (RDCs) of the integer motion vector (IMV) and its neighbors. To improve the prediction accuracy, a hardware-friendly RDC estimation strategy is proposed to construct the error surface. The experimental results show that the corresponding Bjontegaard Delta Bit Rate (BDBR) in Random Access (RA), Low Delay P (LDP) and Low Delay B (LDB) configuration increases by only 0.358%, 0.479%, and 0.511% compared with the VVC test model (VTM) 16.0. Compared with the default FME algorithms of VVC, the time cost of FME is reduced by 53.47%, 56.28%, and 54.23%, respectively, in RA, LDP, and LDB configurations. The algorithm is free of iteration and interpolation, which can contribute to low-cost and high-throughput hardware. The proposed architecture can support FME of all coding units (CUs) in a CTU with one layer of MTT under the quaternary tree (QT), and the CU size can vary from  $8\times 8$  to  $128\times 128$ . Synthesized using GF 28-nm process, the architecture can achieve  $7680\times 4320$ @60 fps throughput at 800 MHz, with a gate count of 244 K and power consumption of 76.5 mW. This proposed architecture can meet the real-time coding requirements of VVC.</description></item><item><title>Efficient ORBGRAND Implementation With Parallel Noise Sequence Generation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10718356</link><description>Guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) is establishing itself as a universal method for decoding linear block codes, and ordered reliability bits GRAND (ORBGRAND) is a hardware-friendly variant that processes soft-input information. In this work, we propose an efficient hardware implementation of ORBGRAND that significantly reduces the cost of querying noise sequences with slight frame error rate (FER) performance degradation. Different from logistic weight order (LWO) and improved LWO (iLWO) typically used to generate noise sequences, we introduce a reduced-complexity and hardware-friendly method called shift LWO (sLWO), of which the shift factor can be chosen empirically to trade the FER performance and query complexity well. To effectively generate noise sequences with sLWO, we utilize a hardware-friendly lookup-table (LUT)-aided strategy, which improves throughput as well as area and energy efficiency. To demonstrate the efficacy of our solution, we use synthesis results evaluated on polar codes in a 65-nm CMOS technology. While maintaining similar FER performance, our ORBGRAND implementations achieve 53.6-Gbps average throughput ( $1.26\times $  higher), 4.2-Mbps worst case throughput ( $8.24\times $  higher), 2.4-Mbps/mm2 worst case area efficiency ( $12\times $  higher), and  $4.66\times 10 ^{{4}}$  pJ/bit worst case energy efficiency ( $9.96\times $  lower) compared with the synthesized ORBGRAND design with LWO for a (128, 105) polar code and also provide  $8.62\times $  higher average throughput and  $9.4\times $  higher average area efficiency but  $7.51\times $  worse average energy efficiency than the ORBGRAND chip for a (256, 240) polar code, at a target FER of  $10^{-7}$ .</description></item><item><title>Highly Defect Detectable and SEU-Resilient Robust Scan-Test-Aware Latch Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10702558</link><description>Soft errors have been a severe threat to the reliability of modern integrated circuits (ICs), making hardened latch designs indispensable for masking soft errors with redundancy. However, the added redundancy also masks production defects as soft errors; this makes it hard to detect defects in hardened latches, thus significantly reducing their reliability. Our previous work proposed the scan-test-aware hardened latch (STAHL) design, the first for addressing the issue of low defect detectability of hardened latch designs. However, STAHL still suffers from two problems: 1) it is not self-resilient to soft errors and 2) a STAHL-based scan design requires one additional control signal. This article proposes a high defect detectable and single-event-upset (SEU)-resilient robust (HIDER) latch to address the issues of the low defect detectability of existing hardened latches and the STAHLs lack of SEU-resilient capability. Two scan designs [HIDER-based scan-cell-S (HIDER-SC-S) and HIDER-based scan-cell-F (HIDER-SC-F)], as well as two corresponding test procedures, are proposed to fully test HIDER latch with only one control signal. Simulation results show that the HIDER latch achieves the highest defect coverage (DC) in both single latch cell detection and scan tests among all existing hardened latch designs. In addition, the HIDER latch has much lower power and a smaller delay than STAHL.</description></item><item><title>Low-Power and High-Speed SRAM Cells With Double-Node Upset Self-Recovery for Reliable Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10704651</link><description>Transistor sizing and spacing are constantly decreasing due to the continuous advancement of CMOS technology. The charge of the sensitive nodes in the static random access memory (SRAM) cell gradually decreases, making the SRAM cell more and more sensitive to soft errors, such as single-node upsets (SNUs) and double-node upsets (DNUs). Therefore, two types of radiation-hardened SRAM cells are proposed in this article. First, a low-power DNU self-recovery S6P8N cell is proposed. This cell can realize SNU self-recovery from all sensitive nodes as well as realize partial DNUs self-recovery and has low-power consumption overhead. Second, we propose a high-speed DNU self-recovery S8P6N cell, which has a soft-error tolerance level similar to the S6P8N. Furthermore, it reduces the read access time (RAT) and write access time (WAT). Simulation results show that the proposed cells are self-recovery for all SNUs and most of DNUs. Compared with RHD12, QCCM12T, QUCCE12T, RHMD10T, SEA14T, RHM-12T, S4P8N, S8P4N, RH-14T, HRLP16T, CC18T, and RHM, the average power consumption of S6P8N is reduced by 48.78%, and the average WAT is reduced by 6.62%. While the average power consumption of S8P6N is reduced by 23.64%, and the average WAT and RAT by 9.07% and 36.84%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Research on Hardware Acceleration of Traffic Sign Recognition Based on Spiking Neural Network and FPGA Platform</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715726</link><description>Most of the existing methods for traffic sign recognition exploited deep learning technology such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to achieve a breakthrough in detection accuracy; however, due to the large number of CNN&#8217;s parameters, there are problems in practical applications such as high power consumption, large calculation, and slow speed. Compared with CNN, a spiking neural network (SNN) can effectively simulate the information processing mechanism of biological brain, with stronger parallel processing capability, better sparsity, and real-time performance. Thus, we design and realize a novel traffic sign recognition system [called SNN on FPGA-traffic sign recognition system (SFPGA-TSRS)] based on spiking CNN (SCNN) and FPGA platform. Specifically, to improve the recognition accuracy, a traffic sign recognition model spatial attention SCNN (SA-SCNN) is proposed by combining LIF/IF neurons based SCNN with SA mechanism; and to accelerate the model inference, a neuron module is implemented with high performance, and an input coding module is designed as the input layer of the recognition model. The experiments show that compared with existing systems, the proposed SFPGA-TSRS can efficiently support the deployment of SCNN models, with a higher recognition accuracy of 99.22%, a faster frame rate of 66.38 frames per second (FPS), and lower power consumption of 1.423 W on the GTSRB dataset.</description></item><item><title>Architectural Exploration for Waferscale Switching System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682064</link><description>With the end of Moore&#8217;s law and Dennard scaling, waferscale systems or processors that integrate multiple pre-tested known good dies (KGDs) on a waferscale-interposer are new approaches to further improve the chiplet-based system&#8217;s performance. This article explores the network on wafer (NoW) architecture of waferscale switching system under several physical constraints. A software-based approach is proposed to redefine the topological property. A five-level butterfly fat-tree (BFT)-like logical topology with 8.96-Tb/s (896 ports  $\times 10$  Gb/s/port) switching bandwidth is achieved based on 2-D-mesh-like physical topology. We show that the proposed BFT-like topology with breadth-first-search (BFS) based traffic balanced routing algorithm reduces 55.6% hops, 41.4% transmission delay, and improves 24.2% throughput compared to 2-D-mesh-like topology under different traffic distributions. This BFT-like waferscale switching system is suitable for high-performance computing and data centers. In addition, the numerical analysis shows that the waferscale package can provide significant power efficiency and latency advantages compared to the typical single-chip package, which mainly benefits from the short-reach IO requirements. Note that the proposed waferscale switching system is compatible with high-switch-capacity dies with advanced process technology, which can further improve system performance. Finally, we present the physical implementations for the waferscale system with heterogeneous dies.</description></item><item><title>PIPECIM: Energy-Efficient Pipelined Computing-in-Memory Computation Engine With Sparsity-Aware Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10701033</link><description>Computing-in-memory (CIM) architecture has become a promising solution to improve the parallelism of the multiply-and-accumulation (MAC) operation for artificial intelligence (AI) processors. Recently, revived CIM engine partly relieves the memory wall issue by integrating computation in/with the memory. However, current CIM solutions still require large data movements with the increase of the practical neural network model and massive input data. Previous CIM works only considered computation without concern for the memory attribute, leading to a low memory computing ratio. This article presents a static-random access-memory (SRAM)-based digital CIM macro supporting pipeline mode and computation-memory-aware technique to improve the memory computing ratio. We develop a novel weight driver with fine-grained ping-pong operation, avoiding the computation stall caused by weight update. Based on our evaluation, the peak energy efficiency is 19.78 TOPS/W at the 22-nm technology node, 8-bit width, and 50% sparsity of the input feature map.</description></item><item><title>MBSNTT: A Highly Parallel Digital In-Memory Bit-Serial Number Theoretic Transform Accelerator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10695040</link><description>Conventional cryptographic systems protect the data security during communication but give third-party cloud operators complete access to compute decrypted user data. Homomorphic encryption (HE) promises to rectify this and allow computations on encrypted data to be done without actually decrypting it. However, HE encryption requires several orders of magnitude higher latency than conventional encryption schemes. Number theoretic transform (NTT), a polynomial multiplication algorithm, is the bottleneck function in HE. In traditional architectures, memory accesses and support for parallel operations limit NTT&#8217;s throughput and energy efficiency. Processing in memory (PIM) is an interesting approach that can maximize parallelism with high-energy efficiency. To enable HE on resource-constrained edge devices, this article presents MBSNTT, a digital in-memory Multi-Bit-Serial NTT accelerator, achieving high parallelism and energy efficiency for NTT with minimized area. MBSNTT features a novel multi-bit-serial modular multiplication algorithm and PIM implementation that computes all modular multiplications in an NTT in parallel. It further adopts a constant geometry NTT data flow for efficient transition between NTT stages and different cores. Our evaluation shows that MBSNTT achieves  $1.62\times $  ( $19.08\times $ ) higher throughput and  $64.9\times $  ( $2.06\times $ ) lower energy than state-of-the-art PIM NTT accelerators Crypto-PIM (MeNTT), at a polynomial order of 8 K and bit width of 128.</description></item><item><title>ReAdapt-II: Energy-Quality Optimizations for VLSI Adaptive Filters Through Automatic Reconfiguration and Built-In Iterative Dividers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665994</link><description>Adaptive filters using least mean square (LMS) algorithms offer high precision, low complexity, and fast convergence, but choosing the correct algorithm can be difficult and time-consuming.

This brief analyzes a specific type of least significant bit (LSB) error that obstructs the recording of the prior LSB count result during continuous counting processes when performing digital correlated double sampling (DDS) and digital CMS. This error stems from the transparent characteristic of the LSB in DDR counter and causes the increase of random noise. A calibration circuit is presented to calibrate the LSB error, which achieves carry propagation and retains the remainder by recording the result of the LSB after each quantization. The random noise is reduced by 25.5% based on simulation results in different CMS iterations after calibration. A  $1280\times 1024$  prototype CIS is fabricated in a 110-nm 1P4M process. The experimental results show that at DDS mode, the CIS random noise is  $147~\mu \text { V}_{\text {rms}}$  and ADC power consumption is  $21.07~\mu $  W, whereas at CMS =2, the noise is  $118~\mu \text { V}_{\text {rms}}$  and power consumption is  $28.07~\mu $  W.

The frequency is regulated with voltage by a universal logic line oscillator (ULLO), which can protect the system from timing violations. The length of the ULLO is self-calibrated by a ULL-based time-digital converter (ULL-TDC) and an in situ half-critical path timing detector, where the ULL is designed to track the critical path delay. A fully synthesizable digital low dropout (DLDO) is designed with the ULL-TDC and a proportional differential (PD) circuit for voltage regulation. The proposed system is implemented in an ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller in 22 nm technology. Simulation results show that the ULL can accurately track the critical path delay with a maximum variation of 3% at 0.6 V and 11.5% at 0.45 V. The UVFR system consumes 13.2&#8211;112 uW of power overhead, and eliminates the voltage margin by 22.3%&#8211;28% while reducing the power consumption by 35%&#8211;42.3%.</description></item><item><title>A 9.6-nW Wake-Up Timer With RC-Referenced Subharmonic Locking Using Dual Leakage-Based Oscillators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10704753</link><description>This brief presents a nano-watt wake-up timer implemented mainly through digital synthesis.

The proposed frequency-lock scheme is applied to design a 360 Hz timer. The implemented timer in a 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS process consumes 9.6 nW and shows a standard deviation of 1.36% without the need for extensive external trimming, mainly due to intra-wafer process variation.

By making the baseband (BB) capacitor larger than the RF capacitor, the former will define the bandwidth (BW). As a result, the RF capacitor can be much smaller, effectively reducing the parasitic capacitance at the RF node and limiting the loss at 10 GHz to only 1.4 dB. The implications and limitations of this capacitive scaling technique are explored, and an eigenvalue-based analysis is presented to derive a transfer function (TF) and simple design equations. Using these design equations, a prototype has been implemented that achieves 20-MHz channel BW while occupying 0.05 mm2 of active area. The design consumes 3.1-mW/GHz dynamic power with negligible static power and obtains a noise figure (NF) of 4.7&#8211;7.0 dB over an RF range of 1&#8211;10 GHz.

A reconfigurable frequency downconverter (RFDC) with two operating modes is proposed to cover both K- and Ka-bands. Distinct from conventional wideband or multi-band structures, the proposed one does not need wide/multiple local-oscillator (LO) or intermediate-frequency (IF) bands. Cooperating with an appropriate LO- and IF-frequency scheme, the reconfigurable architecture moves image interferences out of a passband of RF channels in both the modes, and thus an excellent image rejection is achieved. A compact and fast built-in calibration (BIC) circuit, which is based on an adjacent-channel envelope comparison technique, is also developed to cope with potential phase and gain errors in each RF channel. The phased-array RX is demonstrated using a 65-nm CMOS technology. Measurement results show that the RX successfully covers both 24&#8211;30-GHz and 36&#8211;40-GHz bands, while only requiring an LO range of 9.5&#8211;12.5 GHz with 5-GHz IF. The tested gains, noise figure (NF), and input 1-dB compression point are 16.2/16.9 dB, 5.9/6.2 dB, and &#8722;30.7/&#8722;31.4 dBm at 26/28 GHz when it functions in a differential mode, while the corresponding results are measured as 15.3 dB, 6.6 dB, and &#8722;32.8 dBm at 39 GHz in a common mode. Tested image-rejection ratios (IRRs) are &gt;43 dB in both the operating modes. The BIC circuits&#8217; functionality is also tested. It reduces root-mean-square (rms) gain and phase errors of the RX by 0.12&#8211;0.28 dB and 2.3&#176;&#8211;4.5&#176;, respectively. Therefore, the RX&#8217;s tested beamforming performance is greatly improved, compared with the one without calibration.</description></item><item><title>A 4-bit RFDAC-Based FMCW Modulator for Automotive Radar</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10653810</link><description>This article describes the circuit implementation and measurement results of a 4-bit radio frequency digital-to-analog converter (RFDAC)-based frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) modulator implemented in 28-nm CMOS technology.

The TX consumes 11.7 mW at full speed. Furthermore, the TX supports low-power mode with as low as 700 nW of dc power. The maximum data rate is 2 Gb/s. By applying dynamic data rate to dc-power adaptivity (DDDA), the dc power can be significantly reduced as the data rates decreases. This maintains the energy-per-bit below 10 pJ/b for data rates greater than 100 kb/s with a best value of 3.9 pJ/b and allows the dc power to be greatly reduced down to 700 nW at data rates below 20 kb/s. The measured maximum transmission power is 6.5 dBm. Moreover, the TX achieves 10- dBm effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) with an on-chip 3-D antenna. The core area of the TX is only 0.19 mm2. To the best knowledge of the authors, the proposed TX is the first reported TX with DDDA and achieves the lowest dc power in comparison to similar designs that have been reported to date.</description></item><item><title>A 1-GS/s 11-b Time-Interleaved SAR ADC With Robust, Fast, and Accurate Autocorrelation-Based Background Timing-Skew Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10587286</link><description>This work proposes an autocorrelation-based background timing-skew calibration method. It uses the correlations between adjacent channels to extract timing-skew errors, which relaxes the input bandwidth limitation up to the Nyquist frequency. Moreover, the proposed technique simultaneously detects all channels&#8217; timing-skew errors, guaranteeing fast and accurate convergence. This work also proposes a clock booster. It has a simple structure and can efficiently increase the voltage swing of the clock signal. Equipped with the proposed techniques, a 1-GS/s 11-bit four-channel time-interleaved (TI) SAR analog-to-digital converter (ADC) achieves 59.3-dB SNDR and 78.8-dB SFDR with all skew tones below &#8722;80 dB at the Nyquist input. The total power dissipation is only 3.7 mW with digital computations implemented off-chip. This corresponds to the Schreier FoM of 170.6 dB and Walden FoM of 4.9 fJ/conv-step.</description></item><item><title>An Intrinsically Linear Multi-Rate Continuous-Time Zoom ADC Achieving 97.4-dB DR and 105.7-dB SFDR in 50-kHz Signal Bandwidth</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10550909</link><description>This article presents an intrinsically linear continuous-time (CT) zoom analog-to-digital converter (ADC) architecture that uses a coarse first-order CT delta-sigma modulator ( $\Delta \Sigma $ M) followed by a fine third-order CT- $\Delta \Sigma $ M. The 1.5-bit output of the coarse CT- $\Delta \Sigma $ M is filtered by an 8-tap finite impulse response (FIR) filter, and then, a current-steering DAC provides intrinsically linear outputs to the fine  $\Delta \Sigma $ M. The associated delay is mitigated by increasing the coarse sampling rate by a factor of 4. The coarse  $\Delta \Sigma $ M significantly relaxes the requirements of the fine  $\Delta \Sigma $ M, but despite the faster sampling rate, consumes negligible power, because its noise is canceled for the final output, allowing the use of a relatively large input resistor. The ADC prototype fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process occupies an area of  $0.124~{\text {mm}^{{2}}}$  and consumes only  $243~{\mu }$ W from a 1.2-V supply. It achieves 92.0-dB signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR), 92.3-dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), 97.4-dB dynamic range (DR), and 105.7-dB spurious-free DR (SFDR) over a 50-kHz bandwidth without using DAC linearization or calibration. This corresponds to Schreier FoMs of 175.1 dB (SNDR) and 180.5 dB (DR).</description></item><item><title>A Single-Channel 12-b 2-GS/s PVT-Robust Pipelined ADC With Sturdy Ring Amplifier and Time-Domain Quantizer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555121</link><description>Ring amplifier (RingAmp)-based multiplying digital-to-analog converters (MDACs) feature high energy efficiency and linearity; however, their process, supply voltage, and temperature (PVT)-sensitive transient responses require significant timing overhead, limiting the speed of the pipelined analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). This work introduces a sturdy RingAmp (SRingAmp), which stabilizes the gain, gain-bandwidth product (GBW), phase margin (PM), and transient response by building up compensatory coordination, achieving significant speed and PVT-robustness advantages over prior RingAmps. Furthermore, a time-domain ADC is utilized as the sub-quantizer with two techniques, including a common-mode shifting (CMS) scheme and a partial power-down (PD) operation for the voltage-to-time converter (VTC) and the time-to-digital converter (TDC), respectively. The former allows a near mid-supply common-mode input without degrading the linearity, and the latter improves the power efficiency. With these techniques, a single-channel 12-bit pipelined ADC achieves 2 GS/s in 28-nm CMOS with measured 60.4-dB SNDR and 75.8-dB SFDR at a Nyquist input, consuming 27 mW from a 1.0-V supply and yielding a Schreier figure of merit (FoM) of 166.1 dB.</description></item><item><title>A 2-GS/s Time-Interleaved ADC With Embedded Background Calibrations and a Novel Reference Buffer for Reduced Inter-Channel Crosstalk</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10633775</link><description>Time-interleaved (TI) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are an established architecture, but fundamental problems still exist that prevent replicating the performance of each sub-ADC to the overall TI ADC. This article presents different techniques to overcome the main challenges in implementing an interleaved converter: 1) driving the ADC with sufficient linearity and bandwidth; 2) avoiding the crosstalk through the reference voltage; and 3) mitigating the effect of inter-channel mismatches. The proposed techniques are applied to a 2-GS/s TI ADC implemented in a TSMC 28-nm bulk CMOS process consisting of eight 11-bit 250-MS/s successive approximation register (SAR) ADCs. The prototype achieves a signal-to-noise plus distortion ratio (SNDR) and a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 57.3 dB and  $\mathrm {70.1~dBc }$ , respectively. The SNDR degrades on average by only 1.76 dB compared with the sub-ADCs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed techniques. With a power consumption of 118.6 mW, including input buffer, digital calibrations, and SAR ADCs, the TI ADC achieves a  $\mathrm {99~\text {d}\text {J} /\mathrm {conv-step} }$  Walden figure of merit (FoM) and a 156.6 dB Schreier FoM.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Efficient, High-Resolution kT/C-Noise- Canceled Pipelined-SAR Capacitance-to-Digital Converter With Incomplete-Settling-Based Correlated Level Shifting in 22-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645821</link><description>This article presents a high-resolution and energy-efficient pipelined-successive-approximation-register (SAR) capacitance-to-digital converter (CDC). The converter uses a two-stage SAR analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a residue amplifier (RA) to effectively convert the input signal. To mitigate the impact of kT/C noise during the sampling process, an enhanced kT/C noise cancellation technique is used within a pipelined-SAR architecture. In addition, an innovative incomplete-settling-based correlated-level-shifting (ISCLS) technique is proposed to achieve an equivalent open-loop gain of over 80 dB, thereby enhancing power efficiency and amplification accuracy. Furthermore, a background calibration loop is proposed to track PVT changes and ensure high-precision amplification under PVT variations to ensure PVT stability. The proposed CDC is implemented in a 22-nm CMOS process. The prototype achieves a resolution of 37.12 aF under 384-fF input capacitance with  $4.71~\mu $ W, resulting in a Walden figure-of-merit (FoMw) of 7.9 fJ/conv.-step, which represents more than a twofold improvement compared with previous sub-fF resolution CDCs.</description></item><item><title>Mixed-Order Correlated Dual-Loop Sturdy MASH CT-&#916;&#931; Modulator With Distributed Signal Feed-In and VCO Quantizer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10605845</link><description>This article presents a new structure of multi-loop continuous-time delta-sigma modulator (CTDSM) with voltage-controlled oscillator-based quantizer (VCO-Q) featuring a robust system with design flexibility and calibration-free. A recent work called correlated dual-loop (CDL) sturdy multi-stage noise-shaping (SMASH) delta-sigma modulator (DSM) removes the explicit quantization error extraction digital-to-analog converter (DAC) needed in conventional multi-loop structures. However, the limited design flexibility and the system&#8217;s robustness compromise the application of the CDL. The proposed structure is developed based on the core of the CDL SMASH and addresses its limitations by optimizing the noise transfer function (NTF) and introducing a distributed signal feed-in approach. Furthermore, the signal distribution can also constrain the input swing of the quantizers in our proposed structure. As a result, the VCO-Q, which is limited by nonlinearity issues, can be incorporated well into this design without extra calibration circuits. Fabricated in a 65-nm process, the prototype achieves a 77.2-dB dynamic range (DR) in a 15.625-MHz bandwidth at a 500-MHz sampling rate corresponding to a power consumption of 12.5 mW. The peak Walden figure of merits (FOM) of the proposed design is 97.66 fJ/conv-step with a signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 74 dB.</description></item><item><title>A 12.24-GHz MDLL With a 102-Multiplication Factor Using a Power-Gating-Based Ring Oscillator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620066</link><description>This work presents a multiplying delay-locked loop (MDLL) that can generate an ultralow jitter output signal,  $S_{\text {OUT}}$ , at a very high output frequency,  $f_{\text {OUT}}$ . Conventional MDLLs are limited in increasing  $f_{\text {OUT}}$  due to their series-switch-based multiplexer (MUX) that is used to replace a jittery edge of the ring oscillator (RO) with a clean edge of the reference clock,  $S_{\text {REF}}$ . To overcome this limitation, the proposed MDLL removes the series MUX and uses a power-gating (PG) technique that periodically turns the RO on and off synchronously to  $S_{\text {REF}}$ , thereby removing the accumulated jitter of  $S_{\text {OUT}}$ . By doing this, the PG-MDLL can achieve an ultralow jitter at  $f_{\text {OUT}}$  that is more than 12 GHz with a multiplication factor (N) larger than 100. The PG-MDLL employs a single-pulse generator (SPG) to fill in one missing pulse, while the RO is turned off. Then, to equalize the spacing of all edges in  $S_{\text {OUT}}$ , which come from either the RO or the SPG, a background calibrator was used to correct various errors by dynamically changing the calibration target. We also proposed an analog-digital-hybrid accumulator (HACC) that can provide both fine resolution and wide bandwidth. This PG-MDLL was fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS technology, and it used an area of 0.066 mm2 and consumed a power of 14.7 mW. At 12.24 GHz ( $N =102$ ), the measured rms jitter and reference spur were 122 fs and &#8722;60 dBc, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Digital-PLL-Based Quadrature Clock Generator for a Low-Power and Jitter-Filtering-Capable Clock Distribution Scheme in High-Speed DRAM Interfaces</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620064</link><description>This article presents a low-power and jitter-filtering-capable clock distribution scheme using a digital phase-locked loop-based (DPLL-based) quadrature clock generator (QCG) for high-speed dynamic random access memory (DRAM) interfaces. The conventional clock distribution distributes four quadrature clock signals at a high frequency of  $f_{\mathrm {CLK}}$  to many DQs over long-distance channels, which consumes significant power. On the contrary, the proposed low-power scheme distributes only a single-phase clock at a much lower frequency, i.e., 1/ $8f_{\mathrm {CLK}}$ , so it can reduce the clock distribution power consumption dramatically to 1/32. Then, the proposed QCG generates the precise quadrature clocks with a 25% duty cycle (DC) at  $f_{Q\mathrm {CLK}}$  right before DQs. Since the QCG was designed based on a phase-locked loop (PLL) operating at 1/ $8f_{\mathrm {CLK}}$ , it can filter the input clock jitter while consuming less than 1-mW power. Since the proposed QCG uses a frequency-independent method to correct the quadrature error, it can extensively increase the operating range of  $f_{Q\mathrm {CLK}}$ . This work also presents the synchronous mode-switching divider (SMS-DIV), enabling an immediate transition between IDLE and ACTIVE modes. The proposed QCG was fabricated in 40-nm CMOS and consumed  $900~\mu $ W for generating 2-GHz quadrature output signals. This work achieved a very low quadrature error of less than 0.5&#176; consistently over the frequency range of 1&#8211;4 GHz.</description></item><item><title>100&#8211;112-Gb/s 1.6-Vppd PAM-8 Transmitters With High-Swing 3 + 1 Hybrid FFE Taps in 40-nm Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752934</link><description>This article presents two eight-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-8) transmitters (TX) that achieve 100- and 112-Gb/s data rates, and a high output swing of 1.6 peak-to-peak differential voltage (Vppd) in 40-nm CMOS technology. The high-voltage driver is adopted to enhance the output swing level with the protective cascode and current-bleeding techniques. The hybrid  $3 {+} 1$  tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE) is implemented for efficient channel equalization. Two types of high-speed multiplexers are introduced for the final 4-to-1 serialization: a single-stack and single-stage multiplexer that achieves 33.3 Gbaud/s and a two-stage multiplexer at 37.3 Gbaud/s. Two prototype test chips are fabricated in 40-nm CMOS technology to evaluate the proposed multiplexer designs. The transmitters achieve the PAM-8 data rates of 100 Gb/s (for the single-stage multiplexer) and 112 Gb/s (for the two-stage multiplexer), with worst case eye-opening values of 45 and 57 mV.

Among the various ranging methods, direct time of flight (dToF) stands out as particularly promising for real-time and long-range applications. However, the detection resolution and range of dToF LiDAR systems depend on the minimum width and maximum power of the emitted laser pulse. This work introduces a new laser diode driver (LDD) structure for high-resolution and long-range LiDAR transmitter (TX) system. It features a double pulse overlapping (DPO) scheme to generate ultra-short laser pulses spanning from 100 ps to 2 ns, achieving output pulsewidths significantly shorter than the control signal. Furthermore, two package configurations are implemented and an interleaved bonding method is analyzed and utilized to reduce the parasitic inductance and hence to improve the peak optical power. The parasitic effect analysis and system implementation circuit techniques are also presented. Fabricated in a 180-nm high-voltage BCD process, the two implemented TX systems achieve a minimum pulsewidth of 100 ps or a maximum output current of 15 A within 1-ns pulsewidth.</description></item><item><title>A 60-Frames/s CMOS Image Sensor With Pixelwise Conversion Gain Modulation and Self-Triggered ADCs for Per-Frame Adaptive DCG-HDR Imaging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620065</link><description>CMOS image sensors (CISs) have been evolving rapidly in recent years, offering unprecedented imaging capabilities. For high-end mobile CIS products, high dynamic range (HDR) features are favorably desired. Among various HDR techniques, dual-conversion-gain (DCG)-based HDR imaging offers several advantages due to its high image quality and single-frame basis. For DCG-based HDR applications, however, current state-of-the-art CISs suffer from frame rate reduction and higher power consumption. In this article, we present an adaptive DCG-HDR imaging based on a CIS design with per-frame pixelwise conversion gain (CG) modulation and self-triggered analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). According to the scene to be captured, each pixel adaptively adjusts to its unique CG mode. With a single readout per frame and without image fusion, a proof-of-concept prototype CIS that operates in adaptive DCG-HDR mode achieves a 90.5 dB of dynamic range and a power figure of merit (FoM) of 9.9 nJ/frame $\cdot $ pixel. Compared to DCG-HDR imaging, operating at 60 frames/s, the presented adaptive DCG-HDR imaging reduces CIS power consumption by 38% and enables single-frame pixelwise HDR imaging, which is suitable for future mobile CIS products.</description></item><item><title>A nA-Range Area-Efficient Sub-100-ppm/&#176;C Peaking Current Reference Using Forward Body Biasing in 0.11- &#956; m Bulk and 22-nm FD-SOI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555551</link><description>In recent years, the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has prompted the search for nA-range current references that are simultaneously constrained to a small area and robust to process, voltage and temperature variations. Yet, such references have remained elusive, as existing architectures fail to reach a low temperature coefficient (TC) while minimizing silicon area. In this work, we propose a nA-range constant-with-temperature (CWT) peaking current reference, in which a resistor is biased by the threshold voltage difference between two transistors in weak inversion. This bias voltage is lower than in conventional architectures to cut down the silicon area occupied by the resistor and is obtained by forward body biasing one of the two transistors with an ultra-low-power voltage reference so as to reduce its threshold voltage. In addition, the proposed reference includes a circuit to suppress the leakage of parasitic diodes at high temperature, and two simple trimming mechanisms for the reference current and its TC. As the proposed design relies on the body effect, it has been validated in both 0.11- $\mu $ m bulk and 22-nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator, to demonstrate feasibility across different technology types. In post-layout simulation, the 0.11- $\mu $ m design generates a 5-nA current with a 65-ppm/&#176;C TC and a 2.84%/V line sensitivity (LS), while in measurement, the 22-nm design achieves a 1.5-nA current with an 89-ppm/&#176;C TC and a 0.51%/V LS. As a result of the low resistor bias voltage, the proposed references occupy a silicon area of 0.00954 mm2 in  $0.11~{\mu }$ m (respectively, 0.00214 mm2 in 22 nm) at least  $1.8{\times }$  (respectively,  $8.2{\times }$ ) smaller than fabricated nA-range CWT references, but with a TC improved by  $6.1{\times }$  (respectively,  $4.4{\times }$ ).</description></item><item><title>A PNP-Based Temperature Sensor With Continuous-Time Readout and &#177;0.1&#160;&#8728;C (3&#963;) Inaccuracy From -55&#160;&#8728;C to 125&#160;&#8728;C</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10546474</link><description>This article describes a PNP-based temperature sensor that achieves both high energy efficiency and accuracy. Two resistors convert the CTAT and PTAT voltages generated by a PNP-based front-end into two currents whose ratio is then digitized by a continuous-time (CT)  $\Delta \Sigma $ -modulator. Chopping and dynamic-element-matching (DEM) are used to mitigate the effects of component mismatch and 1/f noise, while the spread in  $V_{\mathbf {BE}}$  and in the ratio of the two resistors is digitally trimmed at room temperature (RT). Fabricated in a  $0.18~{\mu }$ m CMOS process, the sensor occupies 0.12 mm2, and draws  $9.5~{\mu }$ A from a supply voltage ranging from 1.7 to 2.2 V. Measurements on 40 samples from one batch show that it achieves an inaccuracy of  ${\pm } 0.1~{^{\circ }}$ C ( $3{\sigma }$ ) from  ${-} 55~{^{\circ }}$ C to  $125~{^{\circ }}$ C, and a commensurate supply sensitivity of only  $0.01~{^{\circ }}$ C/V.

Also, the EIT system must have low power consumption to facilitate wireless operation during kangaroo care. The application of existing EIT systems primarily designed for adults is limited by the trade-off between power consumption and speed of the impedance readout. This article presents an integrated EIT system in a 65 nm CMOS node featuring a novel ultralow-power time-to-digital impedance readout method based on dc cross-point detection. To increase the resolution of the impedance readout, a dynamic comparator with multi-phase voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based least-common-multiple (LCM) coherent clock control is used, yielding a measured impedance error of 0.94% and a phase error of 0.81&#176; over a frequency range from 100 to 500 kHz in a  $10~\mu $ s measurement time. In addition, a novel fast-settling switch matrix allows multiplexing the single impedance readout channel, significantly decreasing power consumption without degradation in speed. The EIT system has a maximum frame rate of 355 frames per second (fps) and a total power consumption of 1.76 mW. The impedance readout and digitization consume  $172~\mu $ W, a power reduction of 83%&#8211;93% compared to prior work. The frame rate is both suitable for neonatal lung imaging and other fast EIT applications. Both in vitro and adult in vivo measurements are presented.</description></item><item><title>A VCF-Step-Reconfigurable Continuously Scalable-Conversion-Ratio Switched- Capacitor Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10576732</link><description>This article proposes a  $V_{\mathrm { CF}}$ -step-reconfigurable continuously scalable-conversion-reconfigurable CSC (RCSC). We first analyze the working principle of the conventional conversion-ratio SC (CSC) converter and why it has reduced efficiency over a wide voltage conversion ratio (VCR) range. Then, the proposed RCSC reconfigures and thus equalizes the step size of the flying capacitor  $C_{\mathrm { F}}$  voltage ( $V_{\mathrm { CF}}$ ) according to the VCR. This maximizes efficiency over a wider range of VCRs, with limited circuitry complexity. Subsequently, we propose a gate control signal generation scheme that significantly reduces the cost overhead of the reconfiguration. The proposed RCSC can be used in either step-up or step-down mode and is compatible with maximum power point tracking (MPPT) in energy harvesting systems. Implemented with a 65-nm CMOS process, the proposed RCSC reaches a 90% peak efficiency using  $34~{V_{\mathrm { CF}}}$  steps and the widest normalized VCR range with &gt;75% efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A 2.30 NEF Split-Steering Amplifier for Switched-Capacitor Circuits With &#8722;14.2-dB CM-CM Gain and 100-V/&#956;s Slew Rate</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645970</link><description>This article presents three techniques to improve the split-steering amplifier&#8217;s (SSA) performance and robustness. At the system level, differential-mode charge neutralization (DMCN) is introduced first to reset the circuit with minimum burden. Second, a DMCN-compatible common-mode feedforward (CMFF) strategy is introduced to reduce the impact of common-mode (CM) disturbance without introducing extra noise or sacrificing the bandwidth. The above two techniques are universal and can be applied in other pseudo-differential (PD) amplifier architectures. As for circuit implementation, two ring amplifiers (RAs) with different dead zones (DZs) are paralleled with the SSA to improve the slew rate (SR) of the overall amplifier. Dynamic bias adjustment is used to increase the response speed of the RAs and ensure that they will not be activated after slewing, which is critical to keep the overall amplifier low noise. The measured results demonstrate a &#8722;14.2-dB CM-CM gain and 11.7 times SR boosting. The measured noise efficiency factor (NEF) is 2.30, and  $\overline {V_{n}^{2}} \cdot I_{\mathrm { supply}}$  is 1.49 times overperforming previous works.</description></item><item><title>PAICORE: A 1.9-Million-Neuron 5.181-TSOPS/W Digital Neuromorphic Processor With Unified SNN-ANN and On-Chip Learning Paradigm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614635</link><description>The neuromorphic approach of fulfilling brain-like edge intelligence is confronted with three paramount challenges: 1) ever-increasing application demands versus insufficient on-chip resources; 2) diverse data sources and models versus heterogeneous computing paradigms; and 3) adaptation to real scenarios versus absence of on-chip learning. To bridge those gaps in the current research community, this article presents PAICORE, a 537.98-mm2 digital neuromorphic processor with a unified computing and learning paradigm. PAICORE is a scalable 1024-core design, integrating over 1.919 million neurons and 4.773 billion synapses on a single chip. PAICORE is implemented in globally asynchronous locally synchronous (GALS) style with a five-level fat up-down quadtree as dedicated network-on-chip (NoC) infrastructure and tiled 2-D chip array as inter-chip architecture. The distributed processing cores fuse the hybrid spiking neural network (SNN), artificial neural network (ANN), and on-chip spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning models into a unified description by modular-level reconfiguration. PAICORE achieves the peak performance of 20.74 TSOPS, 41.49 TOPS, and 115.25 GSOPS, with the best energy efficiency of 5.181 TSOPS/W, 10.372 TOPS/W, and 1.222 TSOPS/W for SNN, ANN, and on-chip learning paradigms, respectively.

Most existing KWS systems employed noise-dependent training, limiting their accuracy under different noise conditions. Some other works used noise-independent training but required a larger classifier to learn more features under different noise cases. In this work, we prototyped the KWS hardware using two chips: a normalized acoustic feature extractor (NAFE) chip in a 65-nm CMOS and a spiking neural network (SNN) classifier chip in the same technology. The proposed hardware can perform an end-to-end KWS task while achieving robustness across various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and different noise types. In addition, it can mitigate the effects of the process and temperature variations of the ASP circuits, further improving accuracy. The proposed hardware is also fully event-driven, minimizing power consumption when the input activity is low. The end-to-end KWS system consumes 220 to 570 nW across 0%&#8211;100% input activities and achieves 96.5%&#8211;88.0% accuracy across 20 to &#8722;5 dB SNRs on the HeySnips dataset.</description></item><item><title>A Multiply-Less Approximate SRAM Compute-In-Memory Macro for Neural-Network Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10622078</link><description>Compute-in-memory (CIM) is promising in reducing data movement energy and providing large bandwidth for matrix-vector multiplies (MVMs).

However, conventional multi-port scratchpad features a low storage density and a small memory capacity, resulting in limited performance improvements. In this article, we propose a high-density and energy-efficient scratchpad with two read and two write (2R2W) ports based on customized local blocks and a hierarchical accessing approach. Specifically, different global ports can access different blocks at the same time, where local read or write operations are performed with single-port bitcells. For an optimal storage density, push-rule high-density bitcells are used with metal pitch-matched local peripheries inside the block. Besides, hierarchical wordline decoding and fishbone-like vertical signal routing are presented to mitigate the density loss due to massive global signals. To improve the energy efficiency, dual-swing signaling, hierarchical timing scheme, and cascade sensing scheme are developed with negligible area overhead. A 1-Mb 2R2W scratchpad is prototyped in a 12-nm FinFET CMOS technology, achieving a storage density of 3.73 bit/ $\mu $ m2, which is superior to the state-of-the-art (SotA).

However, this process necessitates substantial parameter sizes and continuous memory data accesses, imposing considerable demands on memory bandwidth. Computation-in-memory (CIM) emerges as a promising technology to alleviate this memory bottleneck by its ability to execute parallel computations within structured arrays. Nevertheless, the direct deployment of cost-volume construction on CIM platforms faces several challenges, including functional limitations, reduced compute margins, and structural rigidity. To overcome these obstacles, we present a novel CIM architecture, named cost-volume CIM (CV-CIM), which incorporates the following key features. First, the xor-derived logic integrates fundamental arithmetic functions and heterogeneous CIM array (CA) function together to complete requisite cost computation. Second, the pixel-wise similarity is discovered to enlarge the bit sparsity. Then, sparse-mode CIM leverages the resulting sparsity to enlarge the xor-based computing margin. Third, dual degrees of freedom peripherals collectively contribute to latency reduction through dynamic row computation skipping (row peripheral) and the overlapping of data loading and computing (column peripheral). A test chip is fabricated in 28-nm technology and operates within a voltage range of 0.6&#8211;0.9 V and a frequency range of 50&#8211;286 MHz. Notably, CV-CIM demonstrates support for L0/L1/L2 cost computations and achieves a remarkable peak energy efficiency of 1158 TOPs/W.</description></item><item><title>Exploiting Body-Driven Feedbacks in Physical Unclonable Functions for Ultra Low Voltage, Ultra Low Power Applications: A 0.3 V Weak-PUF</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531796</link><description>This paper introduces an innovative approach to designing a mismatched current mirror with a fully unbalanced output, significantly reducing the minimum supply voltage requirements for Regulated Cascode Current Mirror (RCCM) Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). Leveraging body-driven feedback mechanisms, the proposed circuit reliably operates with supply voltages as low as 0.3V, maintaining stable power consumption through a reference bias current. The resulting PUF achieves remarkable energy efficiency, consuming only 0.3 fJ per bit, without compromising statistical performance. It exhibits a response bias of 49.42%, a reliability of 99.483%, and a uniqueness of 50.176%. Validation of this novel approach is conducted through simulations and measurements on a 130nm CMOS test-chip, considering a nominal supply voltage of 0.3V, &#177;10% supply voltage variations, and a temperature range from 0&#176;C to 75&#176;C. Rigorous experimental verification on 20 chip samples, along with detailed explanations of design methodologies, underscores the robustness and practicality of the proposed Body-PUF design. Comparative analyses against state-of-the-art literature reveal that the Body-PUF outperforms previous PUF designs in Figures of Merit (FOM), making it promising for real-world authentication scenarios. Its outstanding trade-off between performance and practicality positions it as a compelling solution for secure applications, including Internet of Things (IoT) devices and other security-critical systems.</description></item><item><title>Highly Stable PUFs Based on Stacked Voltage Divider for Near-Zero BER Native Sensitivity to Voltage Variations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10613369</link><description>This paper explores a class of highly stable static monostable physically unclonable functions (PUFs) based on stacked sub-threshold voltage dividers between two nominally identical sub-circuits as bitcell core block. More specifically, compared to our previous works where two-transistor (2T) and four-transistor (4T) voltage divider based PUFs were presented and analyzed, here we propose two novel topological variants based on six-transistor (6T) and eight-transistor (8T) solutions which arise from adopting a proper reverse gate-biasing strategy within the stack with the aim of improving the resilience to on-chip noise and voltage variations, while keeping the area overhead low. These novel solutions, along with those already proposed, were tested in 180-nm CMOS technology. Raw measurements show a nominal (at 1.8 V and 25&#176;C) bit error rate (BER) of 0.15% and 0.08% for the 6T- and 8T-based solutions, respectively, along with a BER variation of 0.016% and 0.002% per 0.1 V. With the implementation of a simple masking technique based on measurements at low supply voltage ( $V_{DD} =0.3$  V at 25 &#176;C) along with a temporal majority voting (TMV) scheme, a BER of 0.006% and lower than  $9.77\times 10^{-5}$ %, which is the minimum observable BER for the adopted statistical set, was observed for the 6T-, and 8T-core based implementations, respectively, with a corresponding masking ratio of 8.71% and 7.59%. This is achieved with an area per bit of 5, $174F^{2}$  (6T solution) and 6, $994F^{2}$  (8T solution).</description></item><item><title>A Nonlinear Stream Cipher for Encryption of Test Patterns in Streaming Scan Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654320</link><description>With the biennial doubling of the number of transistors in a given area of silicon, contemporary integrated circuits (IC) are forging more and more often and will continue to forge complex system-on-chip (SoC) designs. Their equally complex manufacturing and in-system tests are now carried out through top-level test data delivery nets that enable fast streaming of test data to, from, and throughout a chip. However, it is essential to apply restrictions mitigating risks associated with unauthorized access and usage of SoCs as well as to protect the test infrastructure against hardware security threats, and thus to prevent leakage of secret information or other sensitive assets while tests are carried out. Existing security IP cores raise concerns related to their complexity in terms of area footprint, performance, power, impact on an SoC integration flow, and testability. This paper presents simple and lightweight, yet effective and scalable, test data stream ciphers (SCs) that can be used to encrypt and decrypt test data employed in tests of SoCs and delivered via Streaming Scan Network (SSN) &#8211; a new packetized test data network. A single cipher is comprised of three Galois nonlinear feedback shift registers working in tandem to yield a large number of parallel, cryptographically secure pseudorandom keystreams. A comprehensive evaluation, including NIST statistical test suits, show high efficiency of the proposed ciphers, and is reported herein.</description></item><item><title>Side-Channel Analysis of Integrate-and-Fire Neurons Within Spiking Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10705320</link><description>Spiking neural networks gain increasing attention in constraint edge devices due to event-based low-power operation and little resource usage. Such edge devices often allow physical access, opening the door for Side-Channel Analysis. In this work, we introduce a novel robust attack strategy on the neuron level to retrieve the trained parameters of an implemented spiking neural network. Utilizing horizontal correlation power analysis, we demonstrate how to recover the weights and thresholds of a feed-forward spiking neural network implementation. We verify our methodology with real-world measurements of localized electromagnetic emanations of an FPGA design. Additionally, we propose countermeasures against the introduced novel attack approach. We evaluate shuffling and masking as countermeasures to protect the implementation against our proposed attack and demonstrate their effectiveness and limitations.</description></item><item><title>Detection and Localization of Hardware-Assisted Intermittent Power Attacks in Mixed-Critical Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752417</link><description>Increasing complexity in power management (PMT) has led to a growing demand for third-party power managers (3PPMs) in Network-on-Chip based Mixed-Critical Systems (NoCMCS). However, a malicious 3PPM can exploit the interdependence of power amongst the router nodes to orchestrate well-structured, covert power attacks. Detection and localization of a malicious 3PPM is crucial to restore standard dynamic PMT and mitigating system performance degradation. We propose a novel, non-invasive, low-overhead, attack detection and localization framework for Hardware Trojan (HT)-assisted intermittent power attacks with random activation and deactivation phases in NoCMCS. In Phase-I, our framework makes use of pre-profiled thermal statistics of router nodes to detect any anomaly at runtime. In Phase-II, it leverages a self-aware methodology to locate the router nodes with malicious 3PPM. The proposed framework can detect multiple intermittent HTs in the network. Experimental evaluations on real-life benchmarks show that Phase-I of our framework is able to consolidate the search space of malicious nodes, reducing almost 90% of Phase-II&#8217;s computational workload. Phase-II localizes the malicious router nodes across various experimental scenarios with zero false positives. We also demonstrate the robustness of our framework for detecting and localizing malicious router nodes for different intermittent HTs with varying burst attacks over time.</description></item><item><title>Meta: A Memory-Efficient Tri-Stage Polynomial Multiplication Accelerator Using 2D Coupled-BFUs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10689717</link><description>Polynomial multiplication (PM) is the computational bottleneck of lattice-based cryptography, such as post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Designing dedicated hardware accelerators for polynomial multiplication is an effective solution to improve the execution speed. However, current mainstream designs ignore the impact of computing array size, resulting in poor design flexibility and low memory utilization. To address these issues, we propose Meta, a memory-efficient tri-stage PM accelerator. Our proposed tri-stage PM algorithm fuses all isolated substages into a unique stage named fused coefficient-wise multiplication (FCWM), ensuring efficient computation. Meanwhile, in different stages of the algorithm, the circuit of two-dimensional reconfigurable coupled butterfly units (2D-RCBFUs) is fine-grained reconfigured to improve resource utilization. Moreover, the low-complexity memory mapping scheme simplifies the address control logic and reduces the hardware overhead. Meta can efficiently support the PM of an arbitrary power of two, which is impossible for previous designs using a 2D computing array. Compared with the state-of-the-art designs, our Meta demonstrates the best memory utilization, achieving up to  $10.0\times $  performance improvement.</description></item><item><title>Power and Frequency Intrinsic Channels on gem5</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623216</link><description>Recent works have highlighted the vulnerability of System-on-a-Chip (SoC) platforms against intrinsic channels attacks. In this threat model, an adversary can leverage vulnerabilities in the SoC&#8217;s firmware, the operating system, or the design tools to gain access to shared resources in the platform and transfer data covertly. Given the diversity of attack avenues and the constant evolution of heterogeneous SoCs, it is not practical to study these attacks using conventional approaches. To address this issue, we propose to employ gem5 in the study of power and frequency intrinsic channels. Our work studies heterogeneous SoCs which feature a processor system and an FPGA. We employ the full system simulation of gem5 to emulate a reference physical device. We then describe the emulation of different intrinsic channels which leverage the clock tree and power distribution network of the SoC to transfer data covertly. Our findings demonstrate that gem5 can accurately replicate the logical behavior of power and frequency intrinsic channels.</description></item><item><title>A 3.5 GS/s 1-1 MASH VCO ADC With Second-Order Noise Shaping</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665920</link><description>In this work, a 3.5 GS/s voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) using multi-stage noise shaping (MASH) is presented. This 28nm CMOS ADC achieves second-order noise shaping in an easily-scalable, open-loop configuration. A key enabler of the high-bandwidth MASH VCO ADC is the use of a multi-bit estimated error signal. With an OSR of 16, an SNDR of 67 dB and DR of 68 dB are achieved in 109.375 MHz bandwidth. The full-custom pseudo-analog circuits consume 9 mW, while the automatically generated digital circuits consume another 24 mW.

The resolution of the DTC needs to be sufficiently fine to suppress its own QE below the intrinsic integer-N jitter and, at the same time, sufficiently coarse to limit the DTC&#8217;s hardware needs. In this manuscript, we propose optimal strategies to determine the effective dynamic range, number of bits, quantization resolution, and unity delay of the DTC to achieve these goals; the additional jitter power introduced by input-dithered quantization methods to eliminate DTC-quantization-induced spurs is also considered. DTCs parameterized following these strategies can come close to realizing the spur-free integer-N PN with minimum hardware. Behavioral simulations confirm our analysis.</description></item><item><title>A Bio-Inspired Energy- and Area-Efficient Sound Localization Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10707608</link><description>This paper proposes an energy- and area-efficient sound localization neural network mimicking the auditory brainstem cognitive function. By adopting the bio-plausible Jeffress model, the proposed neural network locates the sound based on the interaural time difference (ITD) in an energy- and hardware-efficient manner. The proposed network modifies the original structure of the Jeffress model having a pair of long axon lines to provide performance gain. It can reduce power consumption and area by using a single axon line. It can further improve efficiency in terms of power and area by shortening the length of the axon line for pulse propagation. Since only the leading pulse is allowed to propagate through the shortened single axon delay line, the number of delay elements and corresponding network components are reduced. Moreover, it can accurately detect the location of the sound source thanks to the axon line composed of synchronized delay elements. A further reduction of the power consumption is achieved by eliminating redundant pulse propagation through the axon line after the output neuron fires. The proposed sound localization neural network was fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process. The performance evaluation results indicate that the proposed sound localization neural network can detect the location of a sound source with a one-degree resolution at a given robot head size of 3.0125 cm, regardless of process corners. It also indicates that the network achieves up to 86.6% and 97.2% energy and area reduction from conventional sound localization networks, operating at 0.305-V supply voltage.</description></item><item><title>A 12 ps Precision Two-Step Time-to-Digital Converter Consuming 434 &#956;W at 1 MS/s in 180 nm CMOS With a Dual-Slope Time Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680134</link><description>A two-step time-to-digital converter (TDC) is designed for the high-precision time measurement of the DIRC-like TOF (DTOF) detector at the Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF). Extending the measurement range by Nutt&#8217;s method, the TDC clock cycle is interpolated with two voltage-controlled tapped delay lines (TDL) connected by a dual-slope time amplifier (TA). By amplifying the residue from the first-step TDL-based interpolation with the TA and measuring it with the second TDL, the TDC resolution is significantly improved to sub-gate delay. Since the residue is extracted by a new method without the need of TA duplication or delay insertion, the TDC power consumption and conversion time are effectively reduced. By adopting the improved TA circuit into the TDC with a high gain, adjustable output offsets, and good linearity, the TDC measurement precision is guaranteed. In addition, a new DLL structure is proposed to stabilize the TDL against process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations with less power consumption. Benefiting from the proposed residue extraction method and DLL structure, the TDC exhibits low power consumption. To verify the TDC design, a prototype chip with two TDC channels is fabricated in GlobalFoundries (GF) 180 nm CMOS technology for performance evaluation. With a system clock of 150 MHz, it has a resolution (LSB) of 16.5 ps and a maximum sample rate of 6 MS/s. The differential nonlinearity (DNL) error ranges from &#8722;0.98 LSB to 0.87 LSB and the integral nonlinearity error (INL) ranges from &#8722;4.21 LSB to 2.83 LSB. With a bin-by-bin calibration method, the measured TDC precision is 12.1 ps on average within the 0&#8211;20 ns time interval measurement range. In addition, the TDC has low temperature sensitivity and does not require recalibration within a 20 &#176; C temperature range. Each TDC channel consumes  $434~\mu $ W power at 1 MS/s sample rate. The test results confirm that the proposed TDC can achieve high precision with a moderate sample rate and low power consumption without highly scaled technologies, which can meet the requirements of the DTOF detector at STCF.</description></item><item><title>A 2&#8211;6 GHz Reconfigurable High Dynamic Range Receiver With Wideband Variable Gain LNA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10690251</link><description>A wideband high dynamic range software radio receiver for sub-6-GHz applications is proposed. The receiver combines three gain variable modules and an automatic gain control module to achieve high gain dynamic range and constant output voltage. A broadband resistive feedback LNA was designed, and two novel gain switching methods were proposed for the resistive feedback LNA, which reduced the LNA gain while optimizing the input matching performance. In addition, the receiver adopts a voltage mode mixer and uses the impedance translation property to achieve blocker-tolerant performance. In analog baseband (ABB), a fourth-order Butterworth active-RC low-pass filter (LPF) is employed for the purpose of attenuating interference. Furthermore, the receiver is furnished with an automatic gain control amplifier to uphold a consistent output voltage amplitude. A 22 nm CMOS receiver prototype occupies 1.85 mm2 and consumes 51 mW from a 1 V power supply over the 2&#8211;6 GHz operating frequency range. The receiver achieves a gain dynamic range of 9.1-91.9 dB and a noise figure (NF) of 2.4-3.4 dB. When a 0 dBm blocker with a frequency offset of 80 MHz is injected into the receiver, the NF increases to 13.2 dB. The programmable bandwidth of the LPF can be adjusted from 10 to 160 MHz. Moreover, the receiver achieved an in-band third-order input-referred intercept point (IIP3) of &#8722;9.1 dBm and an out-of-band IIP3 of &#8722;2.9 dBm respectively.</description></item><item><title>Analysis of Back-Gate Bias Control on EVM Measurements of a Dual-Band Power Amplifier in 22 nm FD-SOI for 5G 28 and 39 GHz Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10765124</link><description>This paper presents a dual-band power amplifier (PA) covering the 5G n257 to n260 frequency 2 bands (24.25 to 29.5 GHz and 37 to 43.5 GHz), fabricated in the 22 nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) CMOS technology. Its design is based on a distributed balun at the output that efficiently performs a wideband load impedance transformation. The back-gate terminal of each transistor is connected to different pads for detailed back-gate bias variation analysis. Under 5G new radio (NR) modulated signal measurements, we show how the average output power and efficiency can be optimized by varying the back-gate bias, which optimal value depends on (i) the signal bandwidth, (ii) the carrier frequency and (iii) the target error-vector-magnitude (EVM) value. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, the impact of back-gate bias control on the system-level EVM figure of merit is shown for the first time in this work. Overall, with 7.5 dBm and 7.3% mean output power and efficiency, respectively, at 27 GHz, 6 dBm and 5% at 40 GHz, for a 800 MHz bandwidth 5G NR signal, the presented PA shows outstanding performance among wideband/multiband FD-SOI-based PAs covering the 28 and 39 GHz bands, featuring comparable performance to best-in-class narrowband PA designs in FD-SOI technology.</description></item><item><title>Q/V-Band CMOS Beamforming ICs and Integrated Phased-Array Antennas</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666749</link><description>This paper presents 256-element transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) phased arrays for satellite fixed communication at the Q and V bands, which integrate the phased-array antennas with eight-channel beamforming ICs.

It determines plasticity polarity and synapse strength change according to the timing difference between pre- and postsynaptic spikes. The learning curves of STDP differ in temporal window size, magnitude and polarity across different synapse types and brain regions and even within a cell, in different dendritic compartments. To accelerate on-chip STDP learning, various implementations have been proposed. However, they either introduce significant latency due to costly counter-based time difference calculation and substantial area cost due to the implementation of weight change LUTs, or lose biologically-plausible timing information due to oversimplification. For low-cost and efficient on-chip learning, a high-throughput Implicit-timing STDP (ImSTDP) with optimized SR depth and a low-cost register-based Implicit-Timing Look-up (ITL) are proposed. ASIC implementation in 22 nm technology demonstrates that ImSTDP can achieve up to  $2\times $  throughput improvement and  $3.61\times $  power efficiency improvement at 27% less area cost compared to the cutting-edge counter-LUT on-chip STDP learning solution.</description></item><item><title>Low-Power High Precision Floating-Point Divider With Bidimensional Linear Approximation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10652240</link><description>In this paper we propose a novel approximate floating-point divider based on bidimensional linear approximation. In our approach, the mantissa quotient is seen as a function of the two input mantissas of the divider. The domain of this two-variable function is partitioned into  $nx \times ny$  subregions, named tiles, where  $nx, ny$  are chosen as powers of two. In each tile the quotient is approximated with a linear combination of the input mantissas. To achieve fine accuracy, an optimization problem is formulated within each tile to determine the optimal coefficients for the linear combination, which minimize the Mean Relative Error Distance (MRED) of the divider. Furthermore, to make hardware implementation more effective, the minimization problem is appropriately modified to search for optimal quantized coefficients. The hardware structure of the divider only requires a small look-up table to store the linear approximation coefficients, and a carry save adder tree. The proposed architecture is highly tunable at design-time over a wide range of accuracy, depending on the number of tiles chosen for the approximation. The obtained results demonstrate error performance and hardware features superior to the state-of-the-art. The proposed dividers define the Pareto front, considering the trade-off between power-delay-product vs. MRED and area-delay-product vs. MRED, for MRED in the range of  $4\times 10^{-3}-2\times 10^{-2}$ . Application results for JPEG compression and tone mapping further highlight the strength of our proposal, which exhibits Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) very close to 1 in all cases and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) up to 45 dB.</description></item><item><title>Offset Boosting-Oriented Construction of Multi-Scroll Attractor via a Memristor Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680718</link><description>The static architecture of artificial neural networks has fixed synaptic weights, whose connections do not change according to new information or learning experience.

To speed up conversion further, the 2nd-stage&#8217;s MSB is resolved in parallel with residue amplification through reusing the 3 MSB comparators of the 1st-stage via voting, thereby reducing the 2nd-stage&#8217;s conversion time and relaxing the comparator noise requirement. The LSB of the 2nd-stage is also obtained by reusing the 3 MSB comparators of the 2nd-stage through voting. The proposed 2-stage open-loop residue amplifier achieves nonlinearity compensation through a source-follower-based CMFB circuit. With 5.1-mW power consumption, the measured SNDR and SFDR of the prototype ADC are 55.98 dB and 71.8 dB, respectively, for a near-Nyquist input frequency.</description></item><item><title>A 10.23-Bit ENOB 1 kS/s Differential VCO-Based ADC With Resistive Input Stage in Low-Temperature Poly-Silicon TFT Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681527</link><description>This brief proposes an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) based on a low-temperature polycrystalline silicon (LTPS) thin film transistor (TFT) process. A Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO)-based structure is employed to tolerate the process uncertainty. A key challenge in VCO-based ADCs is the non-linearity issue of the VCO. To address this, this brief presents a pseudo-differential architecture with resistive input stage, which significantly suppresses the 2nd and 3rd harmonics and thus improves the linearity. The proposed ADC is fabricated using a 3- $\mu $  m mass-production LTPS process. It achieves a 10.23-bit ENOB at 1 kS/s and 8.22-bit ENOB at 16 kS/s. The FOMW of this brief is  $24\times $  better than the state-of-the-art ADCs in IGZO technology and  $2\times $  better than the best simulation result in LTPS technology. Under extreme PVT variations, proposed ADC can still maintain minor performance changes.

The DSM is designed based on a low-power folded-cascode (LP-FC) current-steering (CS) dynamic amplifier (DA), which has a wide output swing and high gain. A speed enhancement (SE) technique is proposed for LP-FC CS DA to reduce the power consumption further with little gain and noise penalty. Additionally, the proposed PVT-tracking technique (PVTT) compensates the PVT-variation of the output common-mode detection (CMD) circuit of DA with a low dropout regulator (LDO), improving the robustness of DA. The LDO&#8217;s output voltage tracks the PVT variations. The prototype DSM is fabricated in 180 nm CMOS technology. The DSM running at  $f_{\mathrm { S}}$  of 204.8 kHz achieves an SNDR/DR of 94.8/97.3 dB under 1.8 V power supply while consuming  $9~\mu $ W, translating into a DR-based Schreier figure of merit (FoMDR) of 176.9 dB.</description></item><item><title>A 10 Gb/s Single-Ended Receiver Using Time Gap Sense Amplifier for Next-Generation HBM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787261</link><description>This brief introduces a time gap sense amplifier (TGSA) to address the challenges of managing thousands of sense amplifiers (SAs) for next-generation high-bandwidth memory (HBM).

The proposed 4-ch TI DAC achieves a sampling rate (Fs) of 16-GS/s, with each sub-DAC operating at a speed of only Fs/4. Compared with conventional RZ structures, the proposed structure uses fewer clocks and avoids the use of high-speed clocks. Additionally, the output-overlapping design reduces DAC&#8217;s sensitivity to duty-cycle mismatches.

The proposed VR uses a 2-transitor (2-T) pre-regulation (PR) circuit to supply a 2-T core circuit for reducing the dependence of the reference voltage  $(V_{\mathrm { REF}})$  on the supply voltage  $(V_{\mathrm { DD}})$ . Both the core and the PR circuit are biased by the leakage current of the PMOS transistors. Gate and bulk feedback are utilized in the PR circuit to further improve the line sensitivity (LS) and the power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) without any other extra transistors. The proposed design is fabricated in the standard 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS process, while 7 samples have been measured. The design can generate a  $V_{\mathrm { REF}}$  of 235.6 mV and consume a supply current of 0.31 nA under a minimum  $V_{\mathrm { DD}}$  of 0.45 V at 25&#176;C.

The reset power used to charge the integration nodes of the comparator is nearly halved by exploiting the existent integration capacitors with only a single D-flip-flop and few switches. The proposed reset scheme improves the energy efficiency while the small CLK-OUT delay of the dynamic comparator is maintained. The prototype comparators with the conventional or the proposed reset scheme are fabricated in a 22-nm bulk CMOS process. The measurement results of the delay, input-referred noise, and energy consumption show that the flying-capacitor-based reset scheme boosts the overall performance of both the conventional StrongARM and Elzakker&#8217;s comparator by about 1.8-times.</description></item><item><title>A Series-LC-Assisted Oscillator Achieving &#8211;140.2 dBc/Hz Phase Noise and 187.5 dBc/Hz FoM at 10 MHz Offset From 10.7 GHz</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819465</link><description>This brief presents a series-LC-assisted oscillator. By utilizing the series LC, the tank impedance at the oscillation frequency is significantly reduced compared to the conventional parallel LC tank, which contributes to reducing the phase noise (PN). Additionally, large-size cross-coupled transistors should be utilized to maintain the oscillation due to the low tank impedance. This induces a large parasitic capacitance that limits the frequency tuning range (FTR) at high frequencies in the conventional cross-coupled oscillator. In contrast, the presented oscillator can operate above 10 GHz with a sufficient FTR, thanks to the capacitance-boosting capability of the series LC. Fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process, the oscillator achieves a PN of &#8722;140.2 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz offset from a 10.7 GHz carrier, consuming a power consumption of 21 mW, resulting in a figure of merit (FoM) of 187.5 dBc/Hz.</description></item><item><title>A Broadband Gm-Boosted Active Feedback CMOS Low-Noise Amplifier for Low- and Mid-Band 5G Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771806</link><description>An inductor-less wideband LNA is designed for a 5G midband applications. The noise reduction technique is proposed to address the trade-off between input return loss  $(S_{11})$  and noise figure (NF). The proposed structure combines self-cascode transistors and composite transistors to increase  $g_{m}$  without consuming additional current, which can improve NF and linearity. In contrast to conventional noise cancellation techniques, the proposed technique improves the NF by reusing current without a path for noise cancellation. The proposed LNA is designed with a 0.13- $\mu $ m CMOS process and measured. In experiments, the proposed LNA shows a power gain  $(S_{21})$  of 21.5 dB over a 3dB bandwidth of  $0.01\sim 1$ .7 GHz, and  $S_{11}$  is less than &#8722;10 dB over the range 0.01~2 GHz. Also minimum NF of proposed LNA is 1.1 dB. In case of the linearity, the proposed LNA shows an input-referred third-order intercept point (IIP3) of &#8722;7.5 - 2.3 dBm.

Called reduced clock-load flip-flop (RCLFF), the proposed flip-flop minimizes the clock load by merging clock transistors to reduce the clock power consumption regardless of input switching activity. It also provides completely redundant transition-free operation, further reducing the power consumption. Reliable operation with no floating node and contention can enable further power saving by letting the flip-flop in the near-threshold voltage (NTV) region. Performance evaluation in a 28-nm CMOS process indicates that RCLFF achieves up to 60.9% power reduction compared to conventional flip-flops at 0.1 switching activity. By reducing power consumption with moderate DQ latency, the power-delay product (PDP) of RCLFF is improved by up to 64.5%. The Monte-Carlo simulation result reveals that RCLFF can operate reliably down to a 0.3 V supply voltage regardless of process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations.</description></item><item><title>Extended ZVS Range via LC Resonance in Current-Fed Parallel Resonant Converter for AGV Wireless Power Transfer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10818512</link><description>This brief presents a novel approach to extend the zero voltage switching (ZVS) range in the current-fed parallel resonant converter for wireless power transfer in an automated guided vehicle (AGV). Unlike previous methods that focus on tuning capacitors or inductors, the proposed method is to resonate the matching capacitor with a lumped inductor to enable ZVS in the region where the ZVS condition is not met, which is an LC resonance approach. The power dissipation due to ZVS failure is analyzed, and the proposed method to guarantee ZVS operation is described in detail. The simulated and measured results verified that the proposed method extends the range of ZVS by approximately 242% and achieves an efficiency improvement of up to 10.69% under the same load conditions compared to the conventional method.</description></item><item><title>Matching Critical Analog Circuit Components Up To Third-Order Gradients for All Possible Exact Matching Ratios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10644102</link><description>This article presents a systematic approach to generate layouts for two devices, with an arbitrary integer ratio of device sizes, that cancels up to at least third-order gradient effects. A new analysis leads to mathematical constraints on 1-D layouts that meet the required integer ratio and cancel second-order gradients. From those layouts, we apply reflection and rotation symmetries to generate 2-D layouts that cancel higher-order gradients. We demonstrate our proposed methodology on current sense transistors interspersed in active power transistors. Legato electrothermal simulation show our proposed approach, respectively, improves worst-case matching accuracy about a factor of 9.9 and 7.15 when compared to a common centroid (CC) and interdigitated (ID) pattern in the presence of gradients effects. Furthermore, we discuss evaluation metrics that can be used to select one of multiple gradient canceling layouts for any fixed rectangular grid and device application.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Analog IC Security Using Randomized Obfuscation Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10689372</link><description>With advances in technology scaling and globalization of the semiconductor industry, the vulnerability of analog integrated circuits (ICs) to reverse-engineering-based attacks, intellectual property theft, and unauthorized access has increased. Prior state-of-the-art analog deobfuscation techniques, such as those using genetic algorithms (GAs) and the satisfiability modulo theory, require an Oracle (i.e., unlocked IC) to recover the correct key. However, in some scenarios, an attacker present in an untrusted foundry might not have access to the Oracle. We demonstrate an Oracle-less attack using Bayesian optimization (BO) to retrieve the key of locked analog designs. To thwart both Oracle-guided and Oracle-less attacks, we present an automated obfuscation circuit generation framework for securing analog ICs. By employing randomness in obfuscation circuit generation, the proposed analog key-based methodology safeguards the integrity and reliability of analog ICs. Experimental results and security analysis for several analog designs demonstrate the robustness of the proposed technique to optimization attacks based on a GA and BO. We further show that the probability of guessing the correct key through brute force attack for an obfuscated analog circuit is negligibly small  $(4.83\times 10^{-18})$ . The proposed obfuscation scheme incurs an area overhead of less than 1.3% and power overhead of less than 2.64% for a mixed-signal IC.</description></item><item><title>Sobol Sequence Optimization for Hardware-Efficient Vector Symbolic Architectures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10683781</link><description>Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is an emerging computing paradigm with significant promise for efficient and robust learning. In HDC, objects are encoded with high-dimensional vector symbolic sequences called hypervectors. The quality of hypervectors, defined by their distribution and independence, directly impacts the performance of HDC systems. Despite a large body of work on the processing parts of HDC systems, little to no attention has been paid to data encoding and the quality of hypervectors. Most prior studies have generated hypervectors using inherent random functions, such as MATLAB&#8217;s or Python&#8217;s random function. This work introduces an optimization technique for generating hypervectors by employing quasi-random sequences. These sequences have recently demonstrated their effectiveness in achieving accurate and low-discrepancy data encoding in stochastic computing systems. The study outlines the optimization steps for utilizing Sobol sequences to produce high-quality hypervectors in HDC systems. An optimization algorithm is proposed to select the most suitable Sobol sequences via indexes for generating minimally correlated hypervectors, particularly in applications related to symbol-oriented architectures. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated in comparison to two traditional approaches of generating hypervectors based on linear-feedback shift registers and MATLAB random functions. The evaluation is conducted for three applications: 1) language; 2) headline; and 3) medical image classification. Our experimental results demonstrate accuracy improvements of up to 10.79%, depending on the vector size. Additionally, the proposed encoding hardware exhibits reduced energy consumption and a superior area-delay product.</description></item><item><title>Algorithmically Enhanced Design of Spintronic-Based Tunable True Random Number Generator for Dependable Stochastic Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10640136</link><description>This article proposes a tunable true random number generator (TTRNG) based on stochastic magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) switching in the subcritical current regime. The proposed design consists of three parts. The first part is a write/read circuit featuring a static write circuit and an energy-efficient circuit optimized for read operations. The second finds the probability generation array (PGA) similar to the longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. However, the algorithms presented so far for the LCS have not been responsive to finding the Desired-PGA as it must look for the common subsequence among one million sequences, each sequence being 259 long. Hence, the convergence of those algorithms is impossible in this problem. Accordingly, we propose an algorithm to find a common subsequence of length 24, each defining a logic function. We also propose a controller to generate arbitrary probabilities with a zero steady-state error. These parts, especially PGA, make the design highly robust to the process variations. Notably, the proposed design passes the National Institute of Standards and Technology test. The proposed design also reduces energy dissipation compared to previous designs. Also, as it does not require precise sizing, the FinFET technology is appropriately used to design the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Buffer and Splitter Insertion for Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684033</link><description>The extremely low-bit energy characteristic of the adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) circuit makes it a promising candidate for highly energy-efficient computing systems. However, in contrast with conventional circuit design, general logic synthesis tools can not make sure that the circuit functionality of generated AQFP circuits is correct. AQFP circuits require buffer and splitter insertion for dataflow synchronization at all clock phases of the circuit and multifan-out driving. Notably, buffers and splitters inserted take up much area and delay in AQFP circuits, also causing a significant increase in energy dissipation. To address this problem, this article analyses in detail why buffer and splitter insertion is necessary for AQFP circuits and proposes a global optimization framework for this purpose. This framework consists of three parts: 1) logic level assignment; 2) splitter tree generation; and 3) buffer insertion. An integer linear programming algorithm is proposed for the logic level assignment to estimate the globally optimal number of inserted buffers and splitters. Subsequently, a dynamic programming-based multiway search tree generation algorithm is proposed to construct an optimal splitter tree for each net of the input circuit. Moreover, three optimization strategies are proposed to further enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework. Experimental results on ISCAS&#8217;85 and EPFL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework compared with the state-of-the-art, particularly with significant advantages on large circuits.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Data Reuse for Loop Mapping on CGRAs With Joint Affine and Nonaffine Transformations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659174</link><description>Coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) can provide high energy efficiency while maintaining flexibility, which is promising to keep pace with the power requirements and the frequent updates of applicants. With flexible register chains, modern CGRAs enable data reuse within the processing element array (PEA) to reduce on-chip memory accesses and improve pipelining performance. However, existing works pay little attention to comprehensive loop transformations, such as affine and nonaffine transformation, to obtain a data reuse-friendly loop structure. Therefore, this article proposes a data-reuse-friendly loop mapping approach using joint affine and nonaffine transformations. With affine transformations, the distance of loop dependencies could be reduced and then handled by in-PEA routes. With nonaffine transformations (i.e., loop unrolling), small loop kernels could be unrolled and expose more memory accesses for data reuse. To efficiently solve the loop transformation problem, we first establish a reduced polyhedral formulation and then propose a divide-and-conquer-based solution to find optimized transformations with moderate compilation time. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve a speedup up to  $1.74\times $  compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Automatic Design of IGBT Structural Parameters Using Differential Evolution and Machine Learning Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693555</link><description>Insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) are the key component in power electronics, and the intricate relationship between their performance and structural parameters poses a formidable challenge in the design process. This article proposes an automatic optimal design method for IGBT structural parameters to leverage the pretrained machine learning (ML) model to efficiently predict the initial IGBT device&#8217;s performance, followed by utilizing the differential evolution (DE) algorithm to automatically adjust structural parameters based on the disparity between predicted and expected device performance until the expected performance is achieved. The method is validated in the design of punch-through IGBTs (PT-IGBTs) and trench gate field-stop IGBTs (FS-IGBTs), and the performance of technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation of the designed device is similar to the target performance. In particular, the simulation results of the designed FS-IGBT are highly fitted to the datasheet of the commercial device, which verifies the generalizability and effectiveness of the method. In addition, comparative analyses with various algorithms show DE provides the fastest optimization and extraordinary robustness under the exact specifications. Crucially, the proposed design scheme aligns with semiconductor physics. The method simplifies IGBT design without the need for manual tuning and TCAD tool simulation.</description></item><item><title>Graceful Register Clustering and Rebanking for Power and Timing Balancing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643595</link><description>As dynamic power has become the bottleneck to achieving low power, clock power reduction is crucial in modern IC design. Register clustering can effectively save clock power because of significantly reducing the number of clock sinks and register pin capacitance, clock routed wirelength, and the number of clock buffers. In this article, we propose effective mean shift to naturally form clusters according to register distribution without placement disruption. Effective mean shift fulfills the requirements to be a good register clustering algorithm because it needs no prespecified number of clusters, is insensitive to initializations, is robust to outliers, is tolerant of various register distributions, is efficient and scalable, and balances clock power reduction against timing degradation. Furthermore, we devise a rebanking mechanism to legalize the clustering result according to the adopted multibit register library. Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior power and timing balancing.</description></item><item><title>Design and Utilization of Multiskewed Multibit Flip-Flop Cells for Timing Optimization: Design and Technology Co-Optimization Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10677402</link><description>Utilizing multibit flip-flops (MBFFs) in circuit implementation offers a considerable saving on the dynamic power dissipated at the clock networks. However, indiscreetly allocating MBFFs by grouping single-bit flip-flops at the logic synthesis or placement stage in order to greedily save dynamic power severely hinders a full applicability of useful clock skew scheduling to the individual flip-flops in MBFFs, failing in effectively optimizing circuit timing. This is because the two internal clock inverters, consequently, the clock skew value, in an MBFF are shared by all of the flip-flops in the MBFF. This work overcomes this inherent limitation of inflexibility in MBFFs for useful clock skew scheduling by proposing a comprehensive design and technology co-optimization (DTCO) framework. To this end, we devise a new layout of MBFF cells called multiskewed MBFF layout, in which different clock skew values can be set to the individual internal flip-flops at the cost of additional internal clock inverters. With the multiskewed MBFFs, we propose a three-step DTCO flow: 1) DTCO-based flip-flop clustering at the logic stage, which clusters flip-flops considering multiskewed MBFFs; 2) DTCO based on in-place MBFF debanking technique at the preroute stage to facilitate the full applicability of useful skew scheduling at the subsequent stages; and 3) DTCO utilizing MBFF cell layout diversification at the post-route stage, by which useful clock skew scheduling can effectively resolve timing violations. Through experiments with OpenCores benchmark circuits, it is shown that our proposed DTCO flow of reinforcing the effectiveness of useful clock skew scheduling on circuits with MBFF instances is able to reduce the worst and total negative slacks by 36.73% and 50.76%, respectively, while decreasing the clock and total power consumption by 43.46% and 22.70% over that produced by the conventional flow using a state-of-the-art commercial tool.</description></item><item><title>LithoHoD: A Litho Simulator-Powered Framework for IC Layout Hotspot Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10683791</link><description>Recent advances in VLSI fabrication technology have led to die shrinkage and increased layout density, creating an urgent demand for advanced hotspot detection techniques. However, by taking an object detection network as the backbone, recent learning-based hotspot detectors learn to recognize only the problematic layout patterns in the training data. This fact makes these hotspot detectors difficult to generalize to real-world scenarios. We propose a novel lithography simulator-powered hotspot detection framework to overcome this difficulty. Our framework integrates a lithography simulator with an object detection backbone, merging the extracted latent features from both the simulator and the object detector via well-designed cross-attention blocks. Consequently, the proposed framework can be used to detect potential hotspot regions based on 1) the variation of possible circuit shape deformation estimated by the lithography simulator and 2) the problematic layout patterns already known. To this end, we utilize RetinaNet with a feature pyramid network as the object detection backbone and leverage LithoNet as the lithography simulator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed simulator-guided hotspot detection framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on real-world data.</description></item><item><title>Prior-Boosted GRL: Microarchitecture Design Space Exploration via Graph Representation Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10673996</link><description>The design space exploration (DSE) of contemporary microprocessors faces a significant challenge of high-computational cost. In this context, we introduce Prior-boosted graph representation learning (GRL), a novel framework for the DSE of the microarchitectures the microprocessors underpinned by graph embeddings. Using GRL, Prior-boosted GRL constructs a compact and continuous vector space for design representation. This framework is further boosted by an efficient sampling algorithm informed by prior knowledge, which is instrumental in generating a superior set of initial designs to accelerate the exploration process. A well-designed ensemble surrogate model is combined with the multiobjective Bayesian optimization to explore the design space holistically within this graph-embedding domain. Rigorous experimental evaluations conducted on the RISC-V Berkeley-Out-of-Order Machine (BOOM) platform demonstrate that Prior-boosted GRL substantially surpasses preceding methods, achieving a 107.79% enhancement in Pareto front quality compared to the state-of-the-art DSE algorithm. It also outstrips manual designs on performance, power, and area metrics. As of this writing, Prior-boosted GRL holds the first place in the ICCAD 2022 CAD Contest evaluation platform.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Low-Power BIST for Automotive SoC With Periodic Pattern Type Selection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10677544</link><description>In the realm of automotive System-on-Chip (SoC), scan-based logic built-in self-test (LBIST) is commonly utilized for in-system testing, primarily for its cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, this approach encounters challenges, particularly in attaining high-test coverage within constrained test times. The challenge intensifies when implementing low-power patterns, as it further complicates the achievement of adequate test coverage. To overcome these hurdles, this article introduces a novel testing methodology that enhances test coverage using low-toggled patterns. This method consists of two primary phases. Initially, it involves grouping and pairing scan cells (SCs), ensuring adjacent placement of paired cells. The following phase involves the generation of low-toggled patterns, tailored to the specific arrangement of SCs. To optimally detect as many previously undetected faults as possible, this method applies the low-power pattern selectively to particular scan groups. Furthermore, the scan group subjected to low-power patterns alternates after a certain number of patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of this proposed method in both fault detection and power reduction, in comparison to earlier methods.</description></item><item><title>Fast Machine-Learning-Driven Supply Noise-Aware Macromodeling for High-Speed Nonlinear Drivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666877</link><description>Emerging domains, such as artificial intelligence, 5G mobile, and automotive, are increasingly reliant on high-speed circuits for efficient processing, in which achieving high operating frequencies and data rates is crucial to enable productive data exchange and rapid responses. High-speed data as well as low noise margin in the high-speed serial links call for efficient models of drivers. In this article, we propose a fast machine-learning-driven macromodel for high-speed drivers, which can efficiently capture the nonlinear characteristics of drivers considering dynamic supply noise with low model complexity. A decoupling-superposition strategy is employed to effectively calculate the impact of power supply noise. Additionally, we introduce a piecewise-segmented method for macromodel solving to further enhance the speed of model utilization. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to HSPICE, the proposed macromodel achieves up to  $50\times $ &#8211; $1200\times $  speedup while maintaining sufficient accuracy, even for signals with GHz data rate.</description></item></channel></rss>
