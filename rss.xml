In dc&#8211;dc converters, electrolytic capacitors (ECs) are often used as smoothening filters, despite their vulnerability and unreliable operation. Also, the multipeak PV characteristic caused by PSCs is one of the prime challenges in efficient solar PV integration. To avoid these issues, an isolated EC-less dual half-active bridge resonant converter (DHABRC) is proposed and integrated with solar panels using a PSO-based MPPT algorithm for efficient power transfer under PSCs. The DHABRC utilizes two half-active bridges to reduce the switch count and replaces the ECs with film capacitors (FCs). So the converter becomes simple, easy to control, reliable, and economical. For soft-switching and steady-state analysis of the DHABRC, fundamental approximation analysis is used. For the validation of the proof of concept, a 500-W scaled-down laboratory prototype is developed and tested under steady-state and PSCs using shading patterns (SPs) of different voltage and power ratings. Also, the feasibility of using FCs is proved using different tests like startup transient, load dynamics, and changes in SPs.</description></item><item><title>Unified One-Cycle Control for Fully Digitalized ZVS Four-Switch Buck&#8211;Boost Converter During Bidirectional Power Flow Transition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538435</link><description>A unified one-cycle control is presented to achieve bidirectional power flow operation for a four-switch buck&#8211;boost converter employing fully digitalized control. There is no need for analog comparators or digital-to-analog converters. Based on the new definition of operating modes, modulation can be unified in both the directional operations. One-cycle bidirectional power transition with fully zero-voltage switching (ZVS) can be achieved under various voltage conversion gains. A modified control curve of inductor current is proposed to eliminate the power oscillation during operation, and ZVS can be ensured during the transition. A 450-W prototype using the proposed fully digital control under bidirectional power flow operation is verified successfully.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Matrix Based Network for Multi-Module Parallel Megahertz Inverter System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10540377</link><description>As key subsystem of the semiconductor etching system, the multimodule megahertz inverter needs to modulate power through load differences efficiently and accurately, however, losses of resonant inverter modules are reduced only within narrow load range. The existing inverters often fail to mathematically resolve the conflict between power range and efficiency range. This article proposes a method that balances efficiencies and power range for multimodule parallel systems. The essence lies in mathematically designing load trajectories for each module that covers wide power range within efficiency boundaries through a three-matrix passive network. A two-inverters paralleled system is designed with load-sensitive class D inverter modules as an example. Through passive network, the ideal load trajectory is guaranteed. Two 40&#8201;V input, 13.56&#8201;MHz prototypes are built and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method offers various way of designing network, and both networks are able to control the effective impedance trajectory of modules within the desired range. Therefore, the inverter operates with efficiencies above 60% with power varying from 10&#8201;W to 100&#8201;W.</description></item><item><title>A Systematic Method for Studying the Use of DC/DC Converters With Three Discontinuous Conduction Modes as Automatic PFCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10540317</link><description>This article describes a general method for studying the behavior of converters with three discontinuous conduction modes as automatic power factor correctors (PFCs). Some converters with a single discontinuous conduction mode (such as Buck-Boost, Flyback, SEPIC, &#262;uk, and Zeta converters) can behave as automatic PFCs when operating in that discontinuous conduction mode, with a nearly constant duty cycle during each cycle of the line voltage. There are also dc/dc converters that, due to multiple diodes and inductors, can operate in different discontinuous conduction modes. A systematic method for studying these three discontinuous conduction modes was recently presented. This article extends that method to using the aforementioned dc/dc converters as part of an ac/dc converter with low harmonic injection in the line, identifying when the converters behave as &#8220;ideal automatic resistor emulators&#8221; (i.e., configuring ideal automatic PFCs) and when they behave as &#8220;quasi-ideal automatic resistor emulators&#8221; (i.e., as quasi-ideal automatic PFCs). As an example, the article examines a SEPIC converter used as a resistor emulator. In this case, three discontinuous conduction modes are possible, if the inductance of the input inductor is low enough to allow the input bridge rectifier diodes to stop conducting when the transistor is off. The study allows us to determine of the line current waveform when the converter operates in any of the possible discontinuous conduction modes. The results show that quasi-ideal automatic PFC behavior can be achieved in discontinuous conduction modes with low inductance values. Moreover, the results for the SEPIC can be easily extended to the &#262;uk converter operating in the same manner. Finally, the theoretical predictions for the line current from the proposed study were verified through simulation using PSIM (in the case of both the SEPIC and &#262;uk topologies), and through experimentation (in the case of SEPIC).</description></item><item><title>A 1500-A/48-V-to-1-V Switching Bus Converter for Next-Generation Ultra-High-Power Processors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559753</link><description>This article proposes an ultra-high-current 48-V-to-1-V hybrid switched-capacitor (SC) voltage regulator, named the switching bus converter, with a single-stage vertical power delivery architecture for next-generation ultra-high-power processors (e.g., graphics processing units, central processing units, application-specific integrated circuits, etc.). The proposed topology consists of two 2-to-1 SC front-ends and four 10-branch series-capacitor-buck modules, merged through four switching buses. Compared to the existing dc-bus-based architecture, the proposed switching-bus-based architecture eliminates the need for dc bus capacitors, reduces the switch count, and guarantees complete soft-charging operation. Through a topological comparison, this article reveals that the proposed topology achieves the lowest normalized switch stress and the smallest normalized passive component volume among existing 48-V-to-1-V hybrid SC demonstrations, showing great potential for both higher efficiency and higher power density than prior hybrid SC solutions. A hardware prototype was designed and built with custom four-phase coupled inductors and gate drive daughterboards to validate the functionality and performance of the proposed switching bus converter. It was tested up to 1500-A output current and achieved 92.7% peak system efficiency, 85.7% full-load system efficiency (including gate drive loss), and 759 W/in$^{3}$ power density (by box volume), pushing the performance limit of the state-of-the-art 48-V-to-1-V solutions toward higher efficiency and higher power density.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Comparison of Integrated Planar Transformers for 22-kW On-Board Chargers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10551535</link><description>The surge in electric vehicle technology has brought attention to the manufacturing and design of 22-kW on-board chargers using printed circuit boards (PCBs), owing to their manufacturability and compact nature. However, designing transformers for these applications is challenging due to the demands of higher power and a smaller profile. The challenges include achieving optimal current distribution in parallel windings and easier transformer structure with better thermal performance. In addition, the integration of resonant inductance is crucial for regulatory functions and higher power densities. The integration with parallel windings also impacts the overall transformer performance, which needs to be analyzed. This article presents a detailed analysis and design approach for a 22-kW PCB-based transformer with good current sharing, controllable leakage inductance, and a simplified core structure. The study also includes an in-depth analysis of the transformer's flux distribution to minimize core loss. A 22-kW CLLC resonant converter is developed to validate the proposed transformer using PCB-packaged devices. With its modified flux distribution and good current sharing, the integrated transformer enables the converter to achieve a power density of 11.6 kW/L and a peak efficiency of 98.5%.</description></item><item><title>Dual Discontinuous PWM-Based Power Distribution Control of Multisource Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10535742</link><description>The multisource inverter (MSI) is a promising topology for hybrid electric vehicles due to its advanced merits of single-stage power conversion from each source to the motor without dc&#8211;dc converters. However, it is challenging to design a modulation scheme for the MSI since it not only determines the output voltage on the ac side, but also the power distribution between the sources on the dc side. Furthermore, the computation burden for the MSI is heavy due to its unsymmetrical distributed voltage vectors. Given this, this article proposes a dual discontinuous pulsewidth modulation (D$^{2}$PWM) scheme to simultaneously realize power distribution and motor drive control for the MSI. In the proposed D$^{2}$PWM, the MSI is decomposed into two independent subinverters, and modulation schemes of each subinverter can be implemented in symmetric space-vector diagrams, which avoids heavy computational burden under the unsymmetrical voltage vector diagram. Besides, the total switching times of 3 in the proposed D$^{2}$PWM are realized by assigning the desired voltage vector for one of the subinverters aligned with the basic voltage vectors, which reduces the switching losses in this decomposed model and improves the current quality of the MSI. Comparative experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed D$^{2}$PWM.</description></item><item><title>Boost-Based Active Power Decoupling Converter With Voltage Complementary for Electrolytic Capacitor-Less PMSM Drive System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552370</link><description>A new boost-based active power decoupling circuit (APDC) with voltage complementary is proposed for electrolytic capacitor-less (ECL) permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive systems. To increase the dc-link voltage level of the drive system, the decoupling capacitor of the APDC and the output capacitor of a boost converter are connected in series. Then, the decoupling capacitor and the boost output capacitor are complementarily controlled by the APDC to suppress the dc-link voltage ripple effectively. The capacitance and operation voltage of the two capacitors are diverse, improving the drive system's robustness to capacitance. By using this APDC, the speed range of ECL drive systems can be increased and good performance of PMSMs under stable and dynamic operation conditions can be implemented due to small dc-link voltage ripple. Finally, the experiments with the ECL drive system are accomplished to verify the feasibility.</description></item><item><title>Fast Efficiency Optimization Control Based on Orthogonal Current Phasor Model for Linear Oscillatory Motor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10554285</link><description>As the key power part of the linear compressor, the linear oscillatory motor (LOM) has been paid more attention by both academia and industry recently for its compact size, high efficiency, low vibration, etc. In practice, the efficiency of LOM is significantly impacted by the changes in load parameters, of which the best working point can be tracked by the resonant frequency tracking control (RFTC). However, the traditional RFTC with the idea of stroke-current phase suffers some problems, such as slow tracking speed, low accuracy, fluctuate amplitude of piston, and so on. In this article, a novel fast efficiency optimization control algorithm based on the orthogonal current phasor model is proposed for LOM. This new model can achieve the decoupling of current components that act on piston stroke and system efficiency, respectively. Moreover, the driving frequency can be adjusted by current decoupling control with a designed phase-locked loop. Based on the aforementioned, the decoupling control of the LOM drive system can be achieved, which can simultaneously improve the system response speed and the output efficiency. Comprehensive simulation and experimental results have fully demonstrated the advantages of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Minimal Power Loss Control for Doubly Salient Electromagnetic Machine Based on Optimal Currents Distribution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566038</link><description>The traditional doubly salient electromagnetic machine (DSEM) system sets the field current to the rated value regardless of speed or load torque conditions, bringing in large power losses, especially under less rated power conditions. To overcome this shortcoming, this article proposes a minimal power loss control for DSEM based on optimal current distribution. First, based on the power loss calculation model, the quantified relationships between the power loss and field current are obtained under certain speed and load torque conditions. Then, to minimize the power loss, a distribution strategy of field current and armature current is put forward, the command value of field current is achieved according to system operating conditions, and an easy-implemented torque observer with high accuracy is designed for identifying the load torque, in which the magnetic saturation is taken into consideration. Further, to obtain the optimal field current value more easily rather than looking up the large memory-consumed 3-D table or directly solving the sixth-order equation, the current distribution strategies based on an ergodic algorithm and a back propagation (BP) neural network algorithm are proposed, which achieve online calculation of the optimal current and their performances are comparatively explored. With the decreased field current, less power loss as well as smaller cogging torque ripples are desired to be achieved. The simulation and experiments verify the correctness and feasibility of the proposed strategies under multiple operating conditions.</description></item><item><title>Design Optimization of Dual Active Bridge Converter for Supercapacitor Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10530382</link><description>Supercapacitor (SC) is an energy storage suitable for meeting short-term requirements in power conversion systems. However, the low and variable terminal voltage of SC-based energy storage poses challenges to the design of its power electronic interface (PEI) to achieve a high round-trip efficiency and a rapid response of the energy storage system. The PEI design methodologies existing in the literature do not clearly tackle the mitigation of switching and conduction losses over the entire operating range of the SC. This article proposes a design strategy for an SC-interface dual active bridge (DAB) converter. The terminal characteristics of the SC are incorporated into an analytical design formulation aiming to maximize the DAB efficiency over the SC discharging cycle. The resulting optimization problem, addressing both conduction and switching losses, is solved numerically to obtain the optimal circuit parameters. The realization of the design objectives and the obtained efficiency is validated in circuit simulation and experiments on a 250 W laboratory prototype with a 125 V dc bus and a nominal SC voltage of 37.5 V, illustrating the improvement achieved over the conventional design approach.</description></item><item><title>Suppression of AC Coupling Effects on HVdc Transmission System Based on MMC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538426</link><description>As the number of dc transmission systems increases, more dc lines are constructed in close proximity to existing ac transmission lines.

By applying the proposed controller, the MMC-HVdc system can operate without any interference from the ac coupling effect. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through both full-scale simulation and scaled experimental studies.</description></item><item><title>Double Normalization Fault Diagnosis Method for Open-Circuit Faults of PMSM Drives</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538057</link><description>In this article, a double normalization fault diagnosis (DNFD) method is proposed to cope with open-circuit faults of permanent magnet synchronous motor drives. The proposed DNFD method consists of a current normalizer, a time-domain fault variable determinator, a time-domain to angle-domain converter, an angle normalizer, and a fault identification encoder. The affections of the variable torque can be eliminated by the current normalizer, whereas the affections of the variable speed can be eliminated by the angle normalizer, which is the main contribution of this article. To reduce the affections of the following factors, i.e., the calculation error of the time-domain to angle-domain converter, the measurement noises of current sensors, the performance of the analog-to-digital converter, the sampling frequency, and the electromagnetic interference of the system, the hysteresis comparator is employed, in which two fault thresholds are required. Compared with the conventional single normalization fault diagnosis method, the DNFD method has better robustness. The effectiveness of the proposed DNFD method is verified by the experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Parameter Design for Suppressing Current Distortion Caused by DC Bias in Dual-Active-Bridge Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10547319</link><description>The dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter has been widely used, but the current distortion caused by dc bias has not been well addressed due to the high/medium switching frequency. A conventional DAB converter utilizes an auxiliary inductor to enhance efficiency in normal operation, with the auxiliary inductor typically connected to the primary side of the DAB transformer. However, replacing the original auxiliary inductor with distributed auxiliary inductors, one connected to the primary side and the other connected to the secondary side, can help alleviate current distortion when the magnetic core is saturated without influence on the DAB converter during normal operation. In this article, a numerical calculation method is introduced to simultaneously calculate both the induced voltage and the excitation current of the DAB converter under dc bias. Based on the calculation results, a data fitting-based formula for optimizing the inductance distribution is proposed. The rationale behind the proposed formula is elucidated using mathematical methods. The accuracy of the numerical calculation process is verified by simulation results. The effectiveness of the proposed formula is validated through numerical, simulation, and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Challenges and Implementation of Online In Situ RDSON Measurement in a Three-Phase Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10551638</link><description>This article addresses the critical issue of real-time monitoring of on-state resistance (RDSON) of all power semiconductor devices within a three-phase inverter.

This article presents an on-chip condition monitoring (CM) approach addressing these challenges by seamlessly integrating device aging prognosis and dielectric failure detection into a unified circuit platform. Specifically, leveraging the device turn-on transient time (ton) as a reliable aging precursor, we propose a closed-loop ton sensing scheme with self-regulated sampling to enhance precursor readout accuracy while mitigating sensing delays. Furthermore, we improve CM accuracy through junction temperature (TJ) calibration, effectively eliminating temperature-induced effects on precursor measurements. Concurrently, we develop a gate leakage current (IGSS) based sensing scheme for dielectric failure detection, sharing the same circuitry of TJ calibration. Leveraging a proposed reconfigurable tri-mode gate driver, this CM approach minimizes impact on normal system operation. A power IC prototype was implemented on a 180-nm BCD process. Demonstrated on a GaN half-bridge power converter, the proposed CM exhibits the precise detection of both device aging and dielectric failure.</description></item><item><title>The Effect of Bearing Impedance on Online Condition Monitoring for Rotor Winding Insulation of Doubly-Fed Induction Generator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561613</link><description>Doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) play a vital role in wind power generation, yet their rotor winding insulation is susceptible to failure due to high dv/dt voltage from rotor-side converters and mechanical stress under varying operating conditions. While existing methods primarily focus on fault diagnosis, capable of detecting short-circuit faults but lacking in prognostic capabilities, this article delves into the development of an online condition monitoring method based on common-mode leakage current measurement. The study begins with an introduction to the model and measurement technique for winding insulation, followed by an analysis of capacitive coupling, which gives a path for high-frequency leakage current in DFIG systems. Furthermore, the article examines the impact of bearing impedance on rotor-side monitoring outcomes through theoretical analysis and simulation. Finally, the proposed method is validated through online experimentation, demonstrating its efficacy in providing real-time condition monitoring not only for rotor winding insulation but also for the state of shaft grounding devices in wind power generation systems.</description></item><item><title>Rotating Restart Method for TPFS Inverter-Fed Sensorless PMSM Drive System Based on Dual Effective Voltage Vectors Injection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10564192</link><description>This article proposes a solution to the challenge of achieving a reliable restart in sensorless permanent magnet synchronous motors transitioning from a three-phase six-switch inverter to a three-phase four-switch (TPFS) inverter due to faults. The proposed rotating restart method employs the injection of dual effective voltage vectors to synthesize the equivalent zero-voltage vector, under unbalanced capacitor voltage conditions in the TPFS inverter. This synthesis is achieved by incorporating the capacitor voltage offset into the duration calculation of the dual effective voltage vectors. Once the main power supply is restored, the dual effective voltage vectors are injected into the motor windings through the TPFS inverter, producing the short-circuit current influenced by the back electromotive force. The method utilizes the accumulated short-circuit current values to estimate the initial rotor position and speed, enabling a smooth and efficient rotating restart. This innovative method enhances the accuracy of rotor position and speed detection, reduces impulse current, and ensures the fault-tolerant operation of the system. The theoretical analysis is validated through experimental results, demonstrating the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Modeling Method for the Real-Time Simulation of Bridge-Based High-Switching-Frequency Power Electronic Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10533852</link><description>The $R_{\text{on}}/R_{\text{off}}$ model provides high accuracy in the real-time simulation of high-switching-frequency power electronic converters. However, the iterative operations limit the application of the $R_{\text{on}}/R_{\text{off}}$ model in high-switching-frequency domains. This article presents a novel noniterative method for determining the switch statuses of half-bridge arms. By predicting the state variables and correcting the switch status combinations in the natural commutation process with the status switching principle, the accurate switch status can be obtained. Besides, this method adopts the backward Euler method to ensure the system stability and realizes the decoupling among the half-bridge arms, which greatly reduces the modeling complexity and calculation amount when judging the switch status. Finally, an ac&#8211;dc&#8211;ac topology with 100-kHz switching frequency and an $LLC$ resonant converter with 250-kHz switching frequency are implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The parallel solving architecture enables simulation time step as low as 25 ns. The results derived from the real-time simulation and hardware experiment corroborate low FPGA resource consumption and high precision of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Coordination Control for Enhancing Photovoltaic Power Imbalance Tolerant Capability of MMC-Based Photovoltaic System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538210</link><description>The internal reactive power compensation strategy (IRPCS) and harmonic compensation strategy (HCS) can be used in modular multilevel converter&#8211;based photovoltaic systems (MMC-PVSs) for PV power imbalance, but have requirements of extending tolerant capability and degrading internal reactive power at severe imbalance, and have the problem of overmodulation occurring on normal submodules (SMs). This article first merges IRPCS and HCS (IRPCS-HCS) to, to some extent, extend the tolerant capability and reduce the internal reactive power. Subsequently, a dual loop control and a reactive power distribution method are proposed for further optimization. The outer loop eliminates overmodulation on normal SMs via regulating the modulation index upper boundary to realize normal SM full compensation of injected harmonics of overmodulation SMs. To further expand the tolerant capability with the least amount of internal reactive power, the inner loop makes the SM maximum modulation index closely track the upper boundary to prevent overcompensation of internal reactive power, and the reactive power distribution method optimally allocates the reactive power to SMs. Finally, simulation and experimental results are illustrated to verify the feasibility of the proposed control.</description></item><item><title>Mechanism Analysis and Elimination of Multiple Pulse Phenomenon of Active Rectifier in Wireless Power Transfer Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10533858</link><description>Active rectifier is widely used in wireless power transfer systems. On/off delay-compensation technique is commonly used to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of rectifier. However, it also introduces multiple pulse (MP) problem, which could greatly reduce the efficiency and significantly impacts the reliability of system. In this work, the mechanism of MP is comprehensively analyzed and two elimination methods are indicated and compared. The critical circuit parameter is analyzed. To implement the method, an active rectifier with dual-edge D-latch (DEDL) is proposed. The advantage of the DEDL is that the output of comparator can be latched up to achieve an adjustable delay time at both rising and falling edges. As the result, the MP at the output of the comparator will not affect the gate of the power metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor. The rectifier is fabricated with a standard 0.18 &#956;m complementary metal oxide semiconductor process. The core area of chip is 0.268 mm2. The maximum output power of rectifier is 40 mW. The PCE is higher than 90% when Vac = 2 V and 51 &#937;&lt;300 &#937;. The peak PCE is 93.3% when Vac = 2 V and RL = 100 &#937;. Measurement results show the effectiveness of the proposed elimination method, and also prove that the theoretical analysis of MP is correct.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Power Transfer Efficiency in Biomedical Implants: A Comparative Analysis of SS and SP Inductive Link Topologies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10533450</link><description>Inductive link intended to deliver energy to implantable devices is recently becoming a popular method. To improve link efficiency, the compensated capacitors are adopted to resonate at the same frequency with the power transfer frequency on both sides. However, there is limited research on link efficiency and output power concerning quality factors, the selection between serial&#8211;parallel (SP) and serial&#8211;serial (SS) topologies, as well as coil design. This study delves into the efficiency of SP and SS topologies using rigorous mathematical derivations with reflected impedance models in terms of quality factors. It introduces a selection factor to help choose topology based on link efficiency. Results show that SS is better when the load quality factor ($Q_{L}$) is lower than the selection factor, and vice versa. The study also examines the performance limits of both topologies concerning frequency, inductance, and load impedance. It proposes a specific $Q_{L}$ for maximum efficiency and a coil design procedure considering specific absorption rate limitations. By leveraging simulations and the design procedure, the study manufactures a pair of flexible coils for biomedical use. The designed link achieves a 62.99% efficiency under a 500 $\Omega$ load, with an overall efficiency of 46.96% including a passive rectifier.</description></item><item><title>Selected-Interharmonic-Injected Pulse Density Modulation for One-to-Many WPT Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10533863</link><description>Multifrequency one-to-many wireless power transfer (O2M-WPT) is advantageous for charging various medium- and small-power loads, offering cost-effectiveness, simplicity, and minimal cross-coupling effects. However, inevitable hard switching caused by the multifrequency modulation method may lead to significant switching losses. To reduce the switching losses, a novel selected-interharmonic-injected pulse density modulation (SI2PDM) method for simultaneous O2M-WPT systems is proposed in this article. SI2PDM actively injects the selected interharmonics into the primary coil for multifrequency modulation. Besides, SI2PDM artfully regulates the interharmonic by choosing the optimal sequence from the sequences with the same pulse density to achieve independent power allocation. Most importantly, the switching frequency is reduced below the maximum operating frequency, which is beneficial for reducing switching losses and improving efficiency. Comparative experimental results between SI2PDM and an existing method reveal a remarkable 18.58% to 82.83% reduction in inverter power losses and a substantial 1.23% to 20.27% improvement in dc-to-load efficiency. These results affirm the feasibility and effectiveness of SI2PDM in achieving independent power allocation and enhancing efficiency in simultaneous O2M-WPT systems.</description></item><item><title>A Family of Self-Adaptive Interoperable Receivers Based on Multiple Decoupled Receiving Poles for Electric Vehicle Wireless Charging Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538429</link><description>In electric vehicle wireless power transfer (EVWPT) systems, unipolar (UP), bipolar, and multipolar coils produced by different manufacturers are not well compatible with each other, resulting in the interoperability issues. In order to solve this contradiction, a family of self-adaptive interoperable receivers based on multiple decoupled receiving poles is proposed. Based on the two decoupled poles as the receiving coil, the proposed self-adaptive two-pole interoperable receiver can tolerate both the UP transmitting coil and the bipolar (BP) transmitting coil along one direction. On this basis, it is extended to a self-adaptive four-pole interoperable receiver. The four poles are coplanar and decoupled by using four externally decoupling windings. This self-adaptive four-pole receiver can tolerate the UP transmitting coil, the BP transmitting coil along two directions, and the quadrupole (QP) transmitting coil by forming effective equivalent mutual inductances with them, thus achieving interoperability. Moreover, misalignment tolerance is also realized. The experimental results of the two-pole and four-pole proposals show that efficient power transmission can be achieved with various transmitting coils including the UP, BP, and QP transmitting coils, realizing interoperability and misalignment tolerance.</description></item><item><title>Three-Phase Electrolytic-Capacitor-Less LCC-S WPT System With Wide Operation Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538428</link><description>In order to improve the integration and life time of ac voltage input wireless power transfer (WPT) system, a topology based on electrolytic-capacitor-less matrix converter with inductor-capacitor-capacitor-series (LCC-S) resonant network is proposed.

To mitigate reactive power and achieve higher efficiency, the proposed OMC method incorporates dual-side hybrid modulation and primary-side switch-controlled-capacitor (SCC) tuning into the triple-phase-shift (TPS) control. First, the impact of hybrid modulation and SCC tuning on the system characteristics is investigated. The inverter and rectifier zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) conditions are then analyzed to achieve dual-side ZVS with minimal reactive power. Furthermore, a multivariable optimization problem is established based on the power loss analysis. The solution to this problem provides optimal control variables that minimize the overall system loss. Through collaborative modulation and control of the inverter, rectifier, and SCC, the proposed method reduces the rms values of the currents and lowers the turn-off currents for the converters. As a result, this approach improves efficiency in both light- and heavy-load conditions, enabling wide output regulation and full-range efficiency optimization simultaneously. Finally, the proposed method is benchmarked with the existing TPS method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher dc-to-dc efficiency in the power range of 0.2&#8211;2.2 kW, with a maximum efficiency improvement of up to 6.3%.</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency IPT System With Series-Capacitor Full-Bridge Configuration and Inverse Coupled Current Doubler Rectifier for High-Input, Low-Voltage, and High Output Current Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10557712</link><description>Different from the widely used high-voltage (HV) inductive power transfer (IPT) systems, the low-voltage IPT systems with HV input suffer from the following challenges: the high output current brings high conduction losses in the secondary side, especially at the receiver coil; and the HV conversion ratio, such as 400 V input and 24 V output, results in the difficulties in designing the compensation parameters and loosely coupled transformer. To overcome these issues, a novel IPT topology is proposed in this article by incorporating the series-capacitor full-bridge (SCFB) inverter and inverse coupled current doubler rectifier. Thus, the following three improvements are achieved: first, the voltage stress of three primary switches is reduced to half of the input voltage because of the special series capacitor structure. Second, the inherent one-fourth voltage conversion ratio is achieved and reduced greatly the difficulties in designing the compensation parameters. Third, the current flowing through rectifier circuit is reduced to half of conventional full-bridge rectifier. Furthermore, the LC-LCC compensation is employed for matching the proposed SCFB topology while a novel parameter optimization method is proposed to improve the conversion efficiency. To demonstrate the claimed features of the proposed solution, a 1.2 kW IPT prototype with 400 V input, constant voltage 24 V output is built and tested. The measured efficiency curve indicates that the efficiency from 8 to 50 A load keeps above 94.5% and peaks at 96.63%.</description></item><item><title>Identification and Control of LCC-S WPT Systems Using a Linear Parameter Varying Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559452</link><description>In this article, the problem of modeling and control of an LCC-S wireless power transfer (WPT) system in the presence of rectifier discontinuous conduction and load variation is considered. The diode bridge in an LCC-S WPT system often enters the discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), due to its unidirectional conductivity property. To better handle this type of nonlinearity, a linear parameter varying (LPV) model, which allows the model parameters to change with respect to a set of chosen dependence variables, is suggested to describe the dynamic behavior of the system. Based on this LPV model, a modified two degrees of freedom internal model control structure is proposed. The proposed control structure can switch between open loop and closed loop: when the system is in DCM, the system is configured as open loop because the load voltage or current is uncontrollable from the primary side, where any control action may impair the control system performance; otherwise, the system is operated in closed loop. Experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and control method.</description></item><item><title>Precise Modeling of Inductive Wireless Power Transfer With Lossy Magnetic Sheets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10564574</link><description>Accurately analyzing power losses in inductive wireless power transfer (WPT) including lossy magnetic sheet is challenging, as coils have mutual influences on each other's power dissipation. This article proposes a precise analytic model for inductive WPT with lossy magnetic sheets. Combining a partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) with a two&#8211;port network, both self&#8211; and mutual-impedances of coupled coils are accurately calculated considering eddy current effects. Furthermore, the proposed PEEC&#8211;based model incorporates the complex permeabilities of lossy magnetic sheets, thus addressing a critical gap in previous studies that have not considered magnetic sheets with losses in their analysis. The suggested model is verified with finite element method (FEM) simulations and measurements. Compared with an FEM simulator, the proposed model calculates impedances about 31 times faster, substantially reducing the number of meshes. Finally, the ohmic and magnetic losses in coil windings and magnetic sheets are investigated with the proposed model, demonstrating that the phase adjustment of currents using the compensation capacitor is effective to reduce the losses caused by eddy currents and lossy magnetic sheets. The proposed model offers more detailed and accurate loss analysis, compared to conventional methods based on circuit analysis.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Misalignment Tolerance in Hybrid Wireless Power Transfer System With Integrated Coupler via Frequency Tuning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566036</link><description>To enhance the misalignment tolerance and system integration of the wireless power transfer (WPT) system, an integrated coupler consisting of capacitors and coils overlapped coaxially is proposed in this article and integrated into the hybrid WPT (HWPT) system without extra compensation components. The system utilizes the complementary characteristics of different transmission channels to realize the synergistic transfer of different coupled powers under a wide coupling range. Based on the mutual influence between capacitors and coils in terms of electrical parameters in a limited axial projection area and the zero-phase-angle condition considering the mutual capacitance obtained by the fundamental harmonics approximation method, the method of regulating the transfer ratio of the two types of coupled powers is mastered. A method to realize the HWPT with high misalignment tolerance characteristics by frequency tracking is proposed to solve the problem of the system's resonant state being disrupted when the position of the integrated coupler is misaligned. The field-circuit coupling model verifies the feasibility of the analysis and transfer method. Finally, an experimental verification platform for 500 W is built to achieve 82.7% power transfer in the WPT system with 40% unidirectional misalignment.</description></item><item><title>Fast Self-Correction Commutation Method for High-Speed Sensorless BLDCMs With Nonideal Asymmetric Back EMF</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416956</link><description>As a space application, the brushless dc motor (BLDCM) configured in a magnetically suspended control moment gyroscope has extremely high requirements for reliability and power consumption, where accurate commutation control is the key point. However, inevitable nonideal factors, especially the nonideal asymmetric back-electromotive force (back EMF) characteristics, would dramatically reduce commutation accuracy. In order to meet the requirements, this article proposes a fast self-correction commutation method for the sensorless BLDCMs with nonideal asymmetric back EMF. First, it analyzes the influence of nonideal asymmetrical back EMF characteristics on commutation accuracy and obtains the commutation point through the zero-crossing points of line-to-line voltages. Second, a novel phase shifter is proposed for the commutation error correction based on the amplitude transformation of back EMF. Finally, based on the relationship between the voltage difference and the commutation error, a closed-loop voltage adjuster with feedforward compensation is proposed to correct the commutation error using the phase shifter. Both simulation and experimental results validated the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>The Scalable Analytical Model for Calculating the Magnetic Field of Surface-Mounted Permanent Magnet Motor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443101</link><description>This article develops a scalable analytical model that builds a relationship between any surface-mounted permanent magnet (SPM) motor and a general motor with variable slot-opening and air-gap length, considering both the saturation effect and slotting effect. It can not only give the performance of the single SPM motor but also show internal connection among different SPM motors regardless of the motor power and dimension. To account for the iron saturation, the equivalent saturation current combined with simplified BH curves of iron is introduced to directly present the iron magnetic potential distribution without an iterative process. Thus, the proposed model can be used as the surrogate model in the motor design with little computation and provide great insight into the relationship among motors with different power and dimension. Both finite-element analysis and experiment are carried out to validate the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Shrinked-Space Search Method for LVCTs' Parameters Identification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10422730</link><description>Smart thermostats have become a promising device to control electric baseboard heaters' energy consumption while considering their flexibility in the demand response (DR) context. This article applies a shrinked-space search method to identify the tuning parameters of line voltage communicating thermostats (LVCTs). The proposed approach based on Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm takes account of a reference model to drastically shrink the search space while enforcing the identification of a single set of parameters compatible with all arising dynamics of the controller and helping to establish an interpretable model. Furthermore, a subsequent integral tracking strategy has been adopted to convexify the objective function (for identification purposes) while considering the logical constraints governing the thermostat dynamics. This helps to recover the updating logic of the integral part of the controller model. The experimental validation results of eight LVCTs operating in an inhabited house show the effectiveness of the proposed method since it leads to establishing digital twins for the studied controllers. In addition, a case study is presented to demonstrate the usefulness of the reconstructed model in a DR framework.</description></item><item><title>Constant Current Precharging Algorithm for Solid State Power Controllers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10413923</link><description>Semiconductor-based solid-state power controllers (SSPCs) are a promising solution for dc system protection. During the connection of capacitive loads there is an inrush current because of zero initial energy in the capacitor, which can cause damage to the system. One of the main challenges of SSPCs is to suppress the current and voltage overshoot during precharging. In most of the precharging methods, additional circuitry is required, which adds weight, size, and complexity to the system. In this article, a constant current precharging algorithm is proposed. The main semiconductor device is utilized for precharging instead of adding an auxiliary circuit, thus reducing the required number of components. In addition, the proposed algorithm has a higher adaptability to the change of system parameters. Moreover, it is easily implementable to a wide range of semiconductor devices. Analytical evaluations are performed to compute the maximum current reference. Experimental results are presented to verify the operation under various operating conditions.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Bipartite Consensus Control for Multiagent Systems: A Low-Quantity Signal Communication Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10432981</link><description>This article investigates the problem of data-driven bipartite consensus control for multiagent systems under low-quantity signal communication. Dynamic linearization methods are employed to transform the unknown nonlinear model into a data-driven model. The design of a semi-independent dynamic event-triggering mechanism for the input and output channels reduces the communication frequency. Moreover, the quantized encoding and decoding techniques are used to achieve data transfer among agents, which can reduce the length of communication data. Based on the designed communication scheme, a communication energy-saving bipartite consensus control strategy is proposed. Rigorous stability analysis demonstrates that all the signals of the system are ultimately bounded in the proposed data-driven bipartite consensus control algorithm. The proposed control scheme reduces not only the communication frequency but also the transmission bytes, which greatly alleviates the communication pressure. Finally, comparative experimental results from hardware testing further demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the developed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>PID-Based Event-Triggered MPC for Constrained Nonlinear Cyber-Physical Systems: Theory and Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10429823</link><description>Model predictive control (MPC), which obtains the control signal via solving an optimal control problem online, has been widely applied in various cyber-physical systems (CPSs) due to its ability to handle the physical constraints on system variables explicitly. To further reduce the communication and computational resource consumption while ensuring the control performance, a novel event-triggered MPC (ET-MPC) framework is proposed for perturbed nonlinear CPSs with input and state constraints. Specifically, rather than utilizing the instantaneous state error to determine the next triggering instant, which may result in residual error and state mutation for the considered system, the developed strategy adopts the proportion, integral, and differential (PID) of the state error within a time horizon simultaneously to ensure the performance of the CPS under the event-based sampling framework. Moreover, the PID-based ET-MPC algorithm is developed, and the theoretical properties, including feasibility and stability, are strictly proved. Finally, the resource saving property, as well as the control performance of the proposed ET-MPC strategy are extensively verified via MATLAB simulation and a real robot platform powered by the robot operating system, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Inductive Graph Neural Network for Virtual Vibration Sensor Reconstruction in PMSM Powertrain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10420517</link><description>Effective condition monitoring of motors is crucial in diverse electric powertrain systems, including applications in electric transportation and nuclear power plants. Vibration analysis, a key component of motor condition testing, aids in identifying equipment failures, assessing operational status, and guiding preventive maintenance. However, achieving high evaluation accuracy while minimizing the number of vibration sensors to reduce operational and maintenance costs poses a significant challenge. This article introduces a novel approach for vibration testing using a spatial&#8211;spectral-based inductive graph neural network. The proposed algorithm focuses on mining vibration sensor-based clusters to reveal spatial connectivity and spectral correlation patterns.

The results demonstrate the algorithm's ability to enhance evaluation accuracy and reliability. This innovative approach not only contributes to the field of motor condition monitoring but also addresses the challenge of minimizing the number of vibration sensors, thereby reducing manual operation and maintenance costs associated with sensor networks.</description></item><item><title>An Online Junction Temperature Estimating Method for SiC MOSFETs Based on Steady-State Features and GPR</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10409888</link><description>The thermal sensitivity electrical parameter (TSEP) method has gained popularity for online junction temperature (Tj) estimation to enhance the operational reliability of SiC mosfets. However, the performance of existing TSEP methods is affected by varying operating conditions. Achieving a balance between Tj estimation accuracy and cost remains a challenge. To address these issues, this article proposes an online Tj estimation method. First, the on-state voltage and on-state body diode voltage drop are combined as features for Tj estimation. The selection of these two features with different sensitivities under various load current cases improves the accuracy of Tj estimation and enhances the overall sensitivity. Second, Gaussian Process Regression is employed to eliminate the effect of load current from the Tj estimation model, ensuring robustness to operating conditions. Finally, an online Tj estimation strategy based on these innovations is proposed and its effectiveness is validated through multiple experiments in a dc&#8211;dc converter under various operating conditions.

Equalizing the current handled by each phase and embedding an open-circuit switch fault detection module will improve the reliability of the converter. This article addresses these challenges by proposing one diode current sensor at the output, thereby avoiding the need for individual current sensors for each phase. The total diode current and input current of the IBC are sensed, from which the individual phase current is reconstructed. The reconstruction strategy involves selecting the proper sampling instant of the diode current and input current depending on the operating duty cycle. The proposed approach is applicable for both the continuous conduction mode and the discontinuous conduction mode of operation of the converter. Using the reconstructed phase current, both the balancing of the phase current and fault detection are performed. A perturbation-based approach is proposed for the balancing of phase current. The faulty phase can be easily detected from the reconstructed phase current. The proposed method is validated on a prototype of a three-phase IBC showing its robustness and effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>High-Frequency Partial Discharge Characteristics of Solid-State Transformer Interturn Multilayer Insulation Under Repetitive Electrical Stress</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443106</link><description>The solid-state transformer (SST) was regarded as the ideal power router in the energy Internet. However, the partial discharge (PD) in tightly packed SST is one of the main causes of interturn multilayer insulation premature failure. The effect of high-frequency (HF) electrical-thermal coupling stress on SST multilayer insulation's PD characteristics and failure mechanism is not clarified, which is investigated in this article. An HF PD measurement system is established, and a comparative study of the PD characteristics of multilayer polyimide (PI) insulation at different test frequencies and temperatures is explored. The experimental results show that when the frequency exceeds 10 kHz, the PD exhibits a rabbit-ear-like discharge pattern. However, the higher temperature will lead to lower PD inception voltage with large PD magnitudes, which may accelerate the degradation of interturn insulation. According to the phase-resolved PD, PD magnitude, PD number, and discharge phenomenon of the PI layer, the failure process of the multilayer PI system is divided into three stages: electric tree development, electric tree breakdown, and point prebreakdown. In addition, we propose the PD development model of multilayer PI insulation. The research results can provide a theoretical reference for elucidating the PD mechanism under HF stresses.</description></item><item><title>Inductively Coupled in-Circuit Measurement of Two-Port Admittance Parameters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10431603</link><description>In-circuit impedance and admittance measurements are widely exploited in power electronics, from control stability analysis to electromagnetic interference modeling. In particular, the use of clamp-on inductive probes allows nonintrusive measurements of systems in real operating conditions. However, available methods are limited to a single port and cannot evaluate mutual impedances or admittances, hence they cannot properly characterize multiport systems described by impedance or admittance matrices. In this article, a two-port inductively coupled in-circuit measurement method is proposed. Specifically, two inductive probes connected to a vector network analyzer define two longitudinal ports along the clamped wires of the system under test and allow measurement of its two-by-two admittance matrix. The proposed method is firstly verified with a set of known passive loads, then applied to measure the unknown admittance matrix of a single-phase motor drive system. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method in providing accurate measurement of admittance parameters, including mutual terms, both for active and passive two-port devices. Additionally, such two-port admittance matrix measurements are suitable for the identification of the behavioral circuit model of a system, in general for any number of ports.</description></item><item><title>Input&#8211;Output Directed Dependency: Driving-Disentangled Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Control System Representation Learning and Monitoring</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443056</link><description>Process monitoring provides a guarantee for the efficient and safe operation of industrial equipment. However, traditional methods rarely consider the dependency relationship between inputs and outputs in industrial control systems, which can lead to misalignment of process state identification. This study solves the problem based on the following recognitions: 1) the inputs of control systems can drive the changes in the output states, termed input&#8211;output directed dependency; 2) both the inputs and the process inertia are related to the dependency, showing the diversity of dependency relationship; and 3) the dependency can be further disentangled into different subspaces, revealing different types of process variations for fine-grained monitoring. Thereupon, a driving-disentangled dynamic mode decomposition with control method is proposed for control systems input&#8211;output directed dependency representation learning and monitoring. The process variables are divided into inputs and outputs. The input&#8211;output directed dependency is identified, revealing the response of outputs to inputs during adjustment of the process states, which is quite different from common multivariate correlations. A linearly independent vector SelecTion strategy is designed to construct a transformation matrix, which can further disentangle the input&#8211;output dependency into external-driving and self-driving subspaces. Three monitoring statistics are developed for process monitoring. The effectiveness is verified through a gas turbine thermal power experimental rig.</description></item><item><title>Receiver Position Detection System of Wireless Electric Vehicle Charger Based on Novel Active Beacon Structure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10413228</link><description>Wireless power transfer technology is widely used for wireless electric vehicle chargers (WEVC) due to its safety, flexibility, and convenience. However, there is an inevitable misalignment between the transmitter and receiver of WEVC, which reduces the efficiency and stability of power transfer significantly. To this end, this article proposes a receiver position detection (PD) system based on the novel active beacon structure to improve the transfer performance of WEVCs. First, the novel beacons are activated to detect the receiver misalignment accurately before power transfer, which are placed on the vehicle side. Meanwhile, the PD coil matrix is employed on the ground side to achieve large-area and precise misalignment detection. Then, the parameters of PD circuits are optimized to reduce the sampled voltage errors correspondingly. In addition, with the aid of the proposed system structure, a weighted centroid PD algorithm is given to calculate the position of the receiver. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed PD system is verified by using an experimental prototype. The experimental results achieve an offset detection accuracy of 3 mm in the area of 600 mm&#215;480 mm and a yaw angle detection accuracy of 2$^{\circ }$ in the area of 120 mm&#215;480 mm.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Positioning Method for UAV in GNSS-Denied Environments Based on Mechanical Antenna</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418776</link><description>As the application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) become increasingly widespread in various industries, its positioning in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) denied environments plays an indispensable role in certain scenarios such as dense woods and enclosed underground environment. However, there are several existing defects of the conventional positioning method for UAV in GNSS-denied environments, such as the error accumulation and poor long-term accuracy in Inertial Navigation Systems and requirement for sufficient light and high computing power in vision-based localization. Therefore, a novel positioning method for UAV in GNSS-denied environments based on mechanical antenna (MA) is proposed in this work, which consists of MA installed on UAV to generated low-frequency (LF) magnetic signal, the three-dimensional magnetic field sensor in ground base station to receive signal, and the corresponding positioning algorithm based on particle swarm optimization. EM signals in LF bands is applied in positioning, therefore, this method has high propagation stability and anti-interference due to the characteristics of LF bands. Furthermore, because MA technology can greatly reduce the size and power consumption of the LF transmitting system, the LF signal used for positioning can be generated by a portable MA installed on UAV. Theoretical analysis and positioning experiments based on this method are carried out in detail. According to the results, the positioning method proposed in this work is of great feasibility with a mean error &lt; 0.45 m in measurement, which will provide an alternative instrumentation for the positioning of UAV in GNSS-denied environments and can be used in a variety of industrial scenarios with complex electromagnetic environments in the future.</description></item><item><title>Noninvasive Current Distribution Sensing in Press Pack Power Electronic Devices Through Few-Measurement Magnetic Field Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10420519</link><description>Press pack power devices serve as critical components in various high-power applications.

Guided by time-varying carbon intensities, consumers can schedule loads in priority order to use more electricity during low-carbon periods. However, carbon intensities cannot be perfectly forecasted in advance due to the fluctuation of loads and renewable energy. The probabilistic distribution of carbon intensities can be calculated by the grid operator and used as a reference for power consumers. This paper presents a probabilistic carbon emission flow model to calculate the distribution of carbon intensities for consumers. An adaptive regression-based calculation framework combined with a carbon pattern dictionary technique is proposed to handle the high calculation complexity caused by the nonlinearity of the carbon emission flow model. The simulation results from the case studies demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Quantum Grover Search-Inspired Global Maximum Power Point Tracking for Photovoltaic Systems Under Partial Shading Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418984</link><description>Tracking the global maximum power point (GMPP) of photovoltaic (PV) arrays under partial shading conditions (PSCs) is a critical research area.

The dispatch policy is designed to account for both calendrical and cyclical aging effects on BESS, explicitly modeling the impacts of ambient temperature on BESS lifespan. The proposed ADP employs an adaptive critic method and enhanced off-policy deterministic policy gradient (DPG) strategy, addressing the limitations of the on-policy gradient-based ADP approaches, including inadequate exploration, low data usage, and computational complexity. In particular, a customized policy is proposed to guide the algorithm to explore some promising decisions and thereby improve exploration capability and learning efficiency compared to conventional DPG-based learning approaches, which may struggle to find a global optimum due to random noisy action-based exploration or require expert demonstration with extra effort. The proposed method is illustrated using the IEEE 123-node system and compared with the existing ADP methods to prove solution accuracy and demonstrate the effects of incorporating degradation models into control design. Case studies showed that the proposed ADP effectively coordinates DERs with a 10 times smaller optimization gap compared to existing methods, and the incorporation of the BESS life loss model into the proposed control ensures the expected lifespan and results in significant cost savings.</description></item><item><title>Higher Order Sliding Mode Observer Based Fast Composite Backstepping Control for HESS in DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10432969</link><description>Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is effective to compensate for fluctuation power in renewables and fast fluctuation loads in DC microgrids. To regulate DC bus voltage, a power management strategy is an essential issue. In the meantime, the increasing integration of constant power loads (CPLs) in DC microgrids brings great challenges to stable operation due to their negative incremental impedance. In this paper, a fast composite backstepping control (FBC) method is proposed for the HESS to achieve faster dynamics, smaller voltage variations, and large-signal stabilization. In the FBC method, a higher order sliding mode observer (HOSMO) is adopted to estimate the coupled disturbances. Furthermore, the FBC method is integrated with the droop control; so that the FBC-based decentralized power allocation (FBC-DPA) strategy for HESS in DC microgrids is developed. The proposed FBC method is designed based on the Lyapunov function to ensure its stability. Moreover, the design guidelines are provided to facilitate the application of the proposed method. Both simulation and experimental studies under different operating scenarios show that the proposed method achieves faster voltage recovery and smaller voltage variations than the conventional backstepping control method.</description></item><item><title>Rotor Speed Control in Above-Rated Wind Speed Region for Floating Offshore Wind Turbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433765</link><description>Large oscillations of the rotor speed are often observed in floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) operating in above-rated wind speed region. This phenomenon drastically increases the mechanical fatigue loads and even causes damage to the generator. To address this problem, this article first establishes a Reduced-Order Speed-Control-Oriented Model (ROSCOM), which demonstrates the nonlinear coupling of the platform pitch motion and the turbine rotor rotation. The oscillation mechanism is then revealed that the platform pitch motion acts as the zero dynamics of ROSCOM, which can produce limit cycles and result in large oscillations of rotor speed. Based on the Bendixson criterion and Hopf bifurcation theorem, limit cycles and Hopf bifurcation in the platform pitch motion are identified and proved. Additionally, a nonlinear generator torque compensation strategy, named Non-Minimum Phase Platform Pitch Compensation (NMP$^{3}$C), is designed to eliminate the limit cycles in the FOWT system. The rotor speed control performance is thus greatly improved. Electromagnetic power variation, platform pitch variation and tower base fore-aft fatigue loads are also mitigated. Digital simulations based on OpenFAST verify the analysis results and the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Cluster-Based Distributed Secondary Control of Large-Scale DC Microgrid Cluster System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433685</link><description>With the high integration of distributed renewable energies, microgrid (MG) cluster system, consisting of complex physical structures and complicated networked control structure, has emerged as a growing trend. Currently, several secondary control strategies including centralized, decentralized and distributed control have been proposed to solve the secondary voltage restoration and power sharing problem in single DC MG systems. However, few efforts have been made on the secondary control of MG cluster system. In this paper, a first attempt on designing a decentralized cluster-based distributed secondary control strategy is made towards the goal of accurate voltage restoration and power sharing in the DC MG cluster system. Specifically, for the DGs within the same cluster, a distributed finite-time control approach is proposed, while no information exchange is involved among different clusters. As a consequence, all the distributed controllers of different clusters are totally decentralized. If each cluster has only one DG, our proposed control strategy reduces to the existing decentralized ones, while the case of one cluster boils down to distributed control. Rigorous theoretical analysis is provided for such control strategy. Compared to existing methods, our proposed strategy has better transient and steady-state performance than purely decentralized and better robustness than distributed ones. The proposed method is validated in an experimental test system built in OPAL-RT.</description></item><item><title>Synchronverters With Fault Ride-Through Capabilities for Reliable Microgrid Protection During Balanced and Unbalanced Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433740</link><description>Synchronverters are inverters that provide damping and inertia, similar to synchronous generators. Like traditional inverters, synchronverters are adaptable to the microgrid's operation modes. However, synchronverters may generate oscillatory active and reactive powers during faults and produce phase currents with excessive magnitudes. Therefore, this paper develops two fault ride-through (FRT) strategies for synchronverters: average power control and enhanced power control. Both strategies aim to reduce power oscillations, limit current generation, and ensure compliance with grid codes during faults, regardless of the fault conditions and the grid's operation mode. Additionally, synchronverters with the proposed FRT strategies are incorporated into an optimal protection coordination (OPC) program for microgrid protection. The OPC program obtains the settings of time-current-voltage overcurrent relays (TIV-OCRs) and demonstrates the effect of the proposed FRT strategies on microgrid protection. The obtained settings are suitable for both the microgrid's grid-connected and islanded modes during balanced and unbalanced faults. Evaluation results demonstrate the capability of the proposed strategies to reduce power oscillations, limit current generation, and comply with grid codes. Furthermore, the OPC results reveal the most appropriate strategy to minimize TIV-OCRs' operating times in a coordinated manner, regardless of the fault type and microgrid operating mode.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Dimensional Holomorphic Embedding Method for Probabilistic Energy Flow Calculation in Integrated Distribution Power and Heating System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10438069</link><description>A fast probabilistic energy flow (PEF) analysis method is proposed for integrated distribution power and heating system (IPHS) operations. The proposed solution will overcome the low efficiency of the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method for calculating the probabilistic energy flows (PEFs) iteratively, which will require an exhaustive set of energy flow calculations for a large number of samples. First, we use the multi-dimensional holomorphic embedding method (MDHEM) to derive the analytical energy flow expressions, so that the solutions for massive scenarios can be obtained by merely substituting the boundary conditions into expressions. Second, a PEF analysis model is established based on the analytical method for evaluating the impact of uncertainties on IPHSs, and accelerating the efficiency of traditional MCS methods significantly. Case studies presented in the paper show the effectiveness of the proposed method for calculating the PEFs in IPHS operations.</description></item><item><title>Modeling of Dynamic Control Error and Emergency Frequency Control for Direct-Drive PMSG-Based Wind Turbine Under Grid Fault</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10444068</link><description>The utilization of direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous generator-based wind turbine (DPMWT) is prevalent in mitigating unbalanced power during fault process. However, sudden variations in the magnitude and phase angle of grid voltage during grid faults may result in the phase-locked loop transient response (PLTR) of DPMWT. The PLTR changes the output characteristics of DPMWT through converter control loop. This alteration incorporates dynamic control errors and presents potential hazards to the transient frequency of power system. Therefore, the dynamic control error resulting from PLTR under the three-phase fault is found, and an emergency frequency control method for DPMWT under the three-phase fault is proposed. The quantification method for PLTR under the three-phase fault is proposed, and the conduction paths of PLTR within the converter control loop are analyzed. The mechanism of dynamic control error of DPMWT under the three-phase fault is analyzed, and the calculation method for dynamic control error is further proposed. Moreover, the transient frequency characteristics of the power system when affected by dynamic control error are analyzed, and the emergency frequency control method for DPMWT based on the compensation of dynamic control error is put forward. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by case studies.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming Control for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells in an Islanded Microgrid Using Maximum Power Point Estimation Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10449436</link><description>Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are promising distributed generation technologies for their controllability and efficiency. Traditional SOFCs are controlled as a current source to deliver predefined power to the grid. Since a microgrid can operate in both grid-connected mode and islanded mode, grid-forming control ability is required for SOFCs to achieve voltage/ frequency regulation. However, when subjected to load transients, nonlinear output characteristics of SOFCs would probably lead to the collapse of dc-link voltage and unintentional disconnection of SOFCs. To deal with this issue, grid-forming control for SOFCs is presented considering nonlinear characteristics between output current and voltage. The maximum power point (MPP) of SOFCs is tracked using proposed incremental impedance (INI) method and dc-link voltage difference is delivered to adjust output frequency of ac side. In this condition, stable operation and load sharing can be achieved simultaneously during load transients. Simulation results based on PSCAD/EMTDC are provided to validate the effectiveness of proposed grid-forming control.</description></item><item><title>Carbon-Embedded Nodal Energy Price in Hydrogen-Blended Integrated Electricity and Gas Systems With Heterogeneous Gas Compositions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10458410</link><description>Blending green hydrogen from renewable generations into the natural gas infrastructure can effectively mitigate carbon emissions of energy consumers. However, distributed hydrogen blending could lead to heterogeneous gas compositions across the network. The traditional nodal energy price scheme is designed for uniform gas composition, which cannot reflect the impacts of heterogeneous nodal gas composition and carbon emission mitigation. This paper proposes a novel nodal energy price scheme in hydrogen-blended integrated electricity and gas systems (H-IEGS). First, we propose a joint market-clearing model for H-IEGS, where the nonlinear physical properties of gas mixtures caused by heterogeneous gas compositions are characterized. The impacts of hydrogen blending on the carbon emission cost are also quantified. To retrieve the nodal energy price from this highly nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem, a successive second-order cone programming (SSOCP) method is tailored to get the dual variables tractably. Considering the continuous market clearing process, a warm-start technique is proposed to provide initial reference points for the SSOCP to improve computation efficiency. Finally, an H-IEGS test case in Belgium and a large-scale practical case in Northwest China are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Sea-State-Dependent Control Strategy for Wave Energy Converters: Power Limiting in Large Wave Conditions and Energy Maximising in Moderate Wave Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10460174</link><description>Conventional control strategies for wave energy converters (WECs) maximise power capture of the WEC by amplifying its responses, but this exacerbates hardware constraint violations not generally taken into account, causing undesirable shutdown of electrical systems in adverse wave conditions. When WECs operate close to power take-off (PTO) capacity, the primary control objective is to limit peak power for hardware protection purposes, enabling longer continuous electricity generation time. In this paper, we propose a sea-state-dependent control strategy based on model predictive control to maximise the annual energy production of a WEC with a realistic PTO: in small to moderate sea states it adopts a conventional energy-maximising objective function to increase output power, while in higher sea states a speed-limiting objective function may be utilised to enable longer generating time before shutdown becomes necessary. While this control strategy applies to a wide range of WECs, here we carry out the case study on an attenuator WEC called M4, with gearbox transmission and a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) as its PTO, which is being designed for a 1/4 scale ocean test in Albany, Australia. Simulation results show that compared with a benchmark passive damping controller, a 66% increase in annual energy production can be expected at the targeted site.</description></item><item><title>Addressing Wind Power Forecast Errors in Day-Ahead Pricing With Energy Storage Systems: A Distributionally Robust Joint Chance-Constrained Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10461088</link><description>The rapid integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) has imposed substantial uncertainty and variability on the operation of power markets, which calls for unprecedentedly flexible generation resources such as batteries. In this paper, we develop a novel pricing mechanism for day-ahead electricity markets to adeptly accommodate the uncertainties stemming from RESs. First, a distributionally robust joint chance-constrained (DRJCC) economic dispatch model that incorporates energy storage systems is presented, ensuring that the DRJCCs are satisfied across a moment-based ambiguity set enriched with unimodality-skewness characteristics. Second, by applying the Bonferroni approximation method to tackle the DRJCCs, we show that the proposed model can be transformed into a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem. Building on the SOCP reformulation, we then precisely derive the electricity prices, including the energy, reserve, and uncertainty prices. Furthermore, we prove that the obtained pricing mechanism supports a robust competitive equilibrium under specific premises. Finally, a PJM 5-bus test system and the IEEE 118-bus test system are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the suggested approach, underscoring its potential contributions to modern power market operations.</description></item><item><title>Two-Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning for Inverter-Based Volt-Var Control in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10470443</link><description>A two-critic deep reinforcement learning (TC-DRL) approach for inverter-based volt-var control (IB-VVC) in active distribution networks is proposed in this paper. Considering two objectives of VVC, minimizing power loss and eliminating voltage violations, have different mathematical properties, we utilize two critics to approximate two objectives separately, which reduces the learning difficulties of each critic. The TC-DRL approach cooperates well with many actor-critic DRL algorithms for the centralized IB-VVC problems, and two centralized DRL algorithms were designed as examples. For decentralized IB-VVC, we extend the approach to a multi-agent TC-DRL approach and further simplify the multi-agent DRL approach with all agents sharing the same centralized two-critic. Extensive simulation experiments show that the proposed two centralized TC-DRL algorithms require fewer iteration times and return better results than the recent DRL algorithms, and the multi-agent TC-DRL algorithms work well for decentralized IB-VVC problems with different limited real-time measurement conditions.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Joint Distributionally Robust Chance-Constrained Operation for Multiple Integrated Electricity and Heating Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475580</link><description>Integrating heating and electricity networks offers extra flexibility to the energy system operation while improving energy utilization efficiency. This paper proposes a data-driven joint distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) operation model for multiple integrated electricity and heating systems (IEHSs). Flexible reserve resources in IEHS are exploited to mitigate the uncertainty of renewable energy. A distributed and parallel joint DRCC operation framework is developed to preserve the decision-making independence of multiple IEHSs, where the optimized CVaR approximation (OCA) approach is developed to transform the local joint DRCC model into a tractable model. An alternating minimization algorithm is presented to improve the tightness of OCA for joint chance constraints by iteratively tuning the OCA. Case studies on the IEEE 33-bus system with four IEHSs and the IEEE 141-bus system with eight IEHSs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Stability Enhancement of Power Synchronisation Control Based Grid-Forming Inverter Under Varying Network Characteristics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10476727</link><description>Power synchronisation control (PSC) is commonly used in voltage source inverters due to its grid-forming capability and superior performance under weak grid conditions as compared to other grid-forming inverter (GFMI) strategies. However, there is a notable gap in understanding the application and performance of PSC under various practical operating scenarios, particularly in different network types. This paper addresses this critical shortcoming by conducting an in-depth analysis of PSC-based GFMIs under different network types, utilising a comprehensive mathematical and dynamic simulation models. The analysis reveals that the PSC-based GFMI system encounters instability in predominantly resistive networks. To address this issue, two decoupling strategies, namely virtual power (VP)-based and virtual impedance (VI)-based, are proposed to improve power-sharing accuracy and enhance system stability. Furthermore, the improved performance of these proposed strategies is verified in real-time using the IEEE-39 bus network on the OPAL-RT platform. The validation results reaffirm the suitability of PSC-based GFMI in all practical networks.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Approach for Probabilistic Wind Power Forecasting Based on Meta-Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10476768</link><description>This paper studies an adaptive approach for probabilistic wind power forecasting (WPF) including offline and online learning procedures. In the offline learning stage, a base forecast model is trained via inner and outer loop updates of meta-learning, which endows the base forecast model with excellent adaptability to different forecast tasks, i.e., probabilistic WPF with different lead times or locations. In the online learning stage, the base forecast model is applied to online forecasting combined with incremental learning techniques. On this basis, the online forecast takes full advantage of recent information and the adaptability of the base forecast model. Two applications are developed based on our proposed approach concerning forecasting with different lead times (temporal adaptation) and forecasting for newly established wind farms (spatial adaptation), respectively. Numerical tests were conducted on real-world wind power data sets. Simulation results validate the advantages in adaptivity of the proposed methods compared with existing alternatives.</description></item><item><title>MADRL-Based DSO-Customer Coordinated Bi-Level Volt/VAR Optimization Method for Power Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478208</link><description>The high penetration of customer-side variable PVs could change power distribution networks (PDNs) operations and lead to frequent nodal voltage violations. The grid-side static var compensators (SVCs), controlled by distribution system operators (DSO), and customer-side PV inverters are usually used as fast devices to mitigate voltage problems caused by PVs. To effectively coordinate these two types of VAR resources with different ownerships, this paper proposes the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach, which uses the asymmetric Markov game (ASMG) method to implement a cooperative bi-level Volt/VAR optimization (VVO) framework. In this framework, DSO is the leader, which makes decisions at the upper level to minimize the PDNs energy losses by regulating SVCs, and customers are the followers, which make decisions at the lower level by regulating PV inverters to mitigate nodal voltage deviations. Furthermore, a model-free Bi-level Actor-Critic (Bi-AC) algorithm is proposed to solve the ASMG problem, which defines the agents&#8217; decision priorities so that the follower agents can always execute the best response policy. The effectiveness of the proposed Bi-AC method is verified by utilizing improved IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 118-bus case with practical grid operation data.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Dynamic Power Sharing Control for Frequency Regulation Using Hybrid Hydrogen Electrolyzer Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478586</link><description>Hydrogen electrolyzers are promising tools for frequency regulation of future power systems with high penetration of renewable energies and low inertia. This is due to both the increasing demand for hydrogen and their flexibility as controllable load. The two main electrolyzer technologies are Alkaline Electrolyzers (AELs) and Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzers (PEMELs). However, they have trade-offs: dynamic response speed for AELs, and cost for PEMELs. This paper proposes the combination of both technologies into a Hybrid Hydrogen Electrolyzer System (HHES) to obtain a fast response for frequency regulation with reduced costs. A decentralized dynamic power sharing control strategy is proposed where PEMELs respond to the fast component of the frequency deviation, and AELs respond to the slow component, without the requirement of communication. The proposed decentralized approach facilitates a high reliability and scalability of the system, what is essential for expansion of hydrogen production. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated in simulations and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Aggregate Model of District Heating Network for Integrated Energy Dispatch: A Physically Informed Data-Driven Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10485435</link><description>The district heating network (DHN) is essential in enhancing the operational flexibility of integrated energy systems (IES). Yet, it is hard to obtain an accurate and concise DHN model for the operation owing to complicated network features and imperfect measurements. Considering this, this paper proposes a physically informed data-driven aggregate model (AGM) for the DHN, providing a concise description of the source-load relationship of DHN without exposing network details. First, we derive the analytical relationship between the state variables of the source and load nodes of the DHN, offering a physical fundament for the AGM. Second, we propose a physics-informed estimator for the AGM that is robust to low-quality measurements, in which the physical constraints associated with the parameter normalization and sparsity are embedded to improve the accuracy and robustness. Finally, we propose a physics-enhanced algorithm to solve the nonlinear estimator with non-closed constraints efficiently. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Modeling the Coupling of Rotor Speed, primary Frequency Reserve and Virtual Inertia of Wind Turbines in Frequency Constrained Look-Ahead Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10496871</link><description>With the increasing penetration of wind power, wind turbines (WTs) are required to provide primary frequency reserve (PFR) and virtual inertia support to the grid to ensure frequency security. However, in existing frequency-constrained scheduling research, the coupling of WTs' rotor speed, PFR and virtual inertia has been overlooked. This paper accurately models the PFR capacity and virtual inertia of WTs based on WT's rotor speed control and frequency control. Besides, a frequency-constrained stochastic look-ahead economic dispatch (FCS-LAED) model, which co-optimizes the PFR, virtual inertia and rotor speed of WTs is proposed. In this model, WTs' operation constraints are considered more comprehensively compared with existing research. A combination of convex hull relaxation and McCormick envelope is employed to convexify the proposed FCS-LAED model. To further tighten the relaxation, a modified sequential bound tightening method is proposed. Case studies on the modified IEEE 6-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and methods.</description></item><item><title>Stability Constrained Optimal Operation of Inverter-Dominant Microgrids: A Two Stage Robust Optimization Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10497873</link><description>To mitigate the stability issues in the droop-controlled isolated microgrids brought by aleatory renewable energy sources (RESs), which can be added at any given time, this paper proposes a two-stage robust coordination strategy to optimize the operation of multiple flexible resources. In the first stage, a day-ahead unit commitment (UC) schedule of microturbines(MTs) is formulated considering the uncertainty of RESs and loads. In the second stage, an hourly power dispatch and droop gains adjustment scheme for the energy storage devices are developed to minimize the operation cost and ensure the small signal stability. An adaptive column and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) algorithm is developed to solve the stability-constrained two-stage robust optimization problem. Simulation results on a 33-bus microgrid system reveal that compared to benchmarking approaches, the proposed coordination strategy is able to guarantee the small-signal stability with lower cost. And a sensitivity analysis validates the robustness of the methodology against the uncertainties of RESs.</description></item><item><title>A Decision-Dependent Hydrogen Supply Infrastructure Planning Approach Considering Causality Between Vehicles and Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10497898</link><description>In the early commercialization stage of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs), reasonable hydrogen supply infrastructure (HSI) planning is a premise for promoting the popularization of HFCVs. However, there is a strong causality between HFCVs and hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs): the planning decisions of HRSs could affect the hydrogen refueling demand of HFCVs, and the growth of demand would in turn stimulate the further investment in HRSs, which is prompted by the chicken-egg conundrum. Meanwhile, there is a cost contradiction between energy planning and hydrogen refueling convenience of HFCVs caused by HRSs siting planning. To this end, this work establishes a multi-network HSI planning model coordinating hydrogen, power, and transportation networks. Then, to reflect the causal relation between HFCVs and HRSs effectively in the early stage of hydrogen infrastructure investment planning without sufficient historical data, hydrogen demand decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) and a distributionally robust optimization framework are developed. The uncertainty of hydrogen demand is modeled as a Wasserstein ambiguity set with a decision-dependent empirical probability distribution. Subsequently, to reduce the computational complexity caused by the introduction of a large number of scenarios and high-dimensional nonlinear constraints, we developed an improved distribution shaping method and techniques of scenario and variable reduction to derive the solvable form with less computing burden. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that this method can reduce costs by at least 7.7% compared with traditional methods and will be more effective in large-scale HSI planning issues. Further, we put forward effective suggestions for the policymakers and investors.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Optimal Scheduling With Heterogeneous Uncertainty Information: A Framework for Hydrogen Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10499851</link><description>Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has emerged as a favored methodology for addressing the uncertainties stemming from renewable energy sources. However, existing DRO frameworks primarily focus on single types of uncertainty characteristics, such as moments. Exploring novel ambiguity sets that encompass heterogeneous uncertainty information to mitigate decision conservatism is thus an essential and strategic move. This paper introduces a day-ahead optimal scheduling model tailored for electricity-hydrogen systems under renewable uncertainty, with embedded technologies of hydrogen production, storage, and utilization. Three novel ambiguity sets enriched with the moment, Wasserstein distance, and unimodality information are adeptly devised. Building upon these elaborated ambiguity sets, we develop efficient and scalable reformulations of the expected objective function and uncertain constraints, leading to either a tractable mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem or a linear programming problem. We validate the effectiveness and operating flexibility of the proposed electricity-hydrogen model using both a 6-bus test system and the IEEE 118-bus test system. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superior cost performance and computational efficiency of our developed DRO approaches.</description></item><item><title>Spatial-Temporal Wind Power Probabilistic Forecasting Based on Time-Aware Graph Convolutional Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10502289</link><description>Spatial-temporal wind power prediction is of enormous importance to the grid-connected operation of multiple wind farms in the wind power system. However, most of the conventional methods are usually limited to predicting an individual wind farm's power, and thus lack enough effectiveness of wind power forecasting of multiple adjacent wind farms. This paper proposes a novel spatial-temporal wind power probabilistic prediction approach, named ZF-GCN-MHTQF, based on time zigzags and flexible convolution at graph convolutional network, point-wise loss function and the heavy-tailed quantile function. The proposed framework combines the advantages of time zigzags and flexible convolution at graph convolutional networks that can extract temporally conditioned topological information from multiple wind farms efficiently and incorporate the extracted topological information to predict wind power. At the same time, the proposed method incorporates the strengths of point-wise loss functions and heavy-tailed quantile functions which can effectively tackle the problem of the traditional multi-quantile regression and accurately capture the full conditional distribution information of wind power. In our experiments, two real-world wind power datasets from Australia are utilized to validate the proposed model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art spatial-temporal models.</description></item><item><title>Robust Learning-Based Model Predictive Control for Wave Energy Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504609</link><description>This paper proposes a robust learning-based model predictive control (MPC) strategy tailored for sea wave energy converters (WECs). The control algorithm aims to maximize power extraction efficiency and maintain the WECs' operational safety over a wide range of sea conditions, subject to system constraints and plant-model mismatches. The theoretical basis is the robust tube-based MPC (RTMPC), enabling WEC system state trajectories to evolve around the noise-free nominal WEC model state trajectories. The disturbances can be bounded by pre-computed uncertainty sets for tightening the WEC's physical constraints to guarantee the constraint satisfaction of an uncertain WEC system. Typically, RTMPC constructs a tube with constant sets of uncertainties, which is likely to be overly conservative and hence potentially degrades energy conversion performance. In this work, a machine learning-based uncertainty set is introduced to dynamically predict and quantify the model uncertainties at each sampling instant, which can effectively enlarge the feasible region of the WEC TMPC control problem. The proposed RTMPC not only ensures improved energy conversion efficiency but also guarantees the operational safety of WECs under uncertain conditions. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed controller.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Forecasting of Large Distributed Solar PV Fleets Using Sparse Smart Inverter Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504585</link><description>Ultra-short-term power forecasting for distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) generation is a largely unaddressed, highly challenging problem due to the prohibitive real-time data collection and processing requirements for a sheer number of distributed PV units. In this paper, we propose an innovative idea of forecasting the power output of a large fleet of distributed PV units using limited real-time data of a sparsely selected set of PV units, referred to as pilot units. We develop a two-stage method to address this problem. In the planning stage, we use the K-medoids clustering algorithm to select pilot units for the installation of real-time remote monitoring infrastructure. In the operation stage, we devise a deep learning framework integrating Long Short-Term Memory, Graph Convolutional Network, Multilayer Perceptron to capture the spatio-temporal power generation patterns between pilot units and other units, and forecast the power outputs of all units in a large PV fleet using the real-time data from the few selected pilot units only. Case study results show that our proposed method outperforms all baseline methods in forecasting for power outputs of individual PV units as well as the whole PV fleet, and the forecasting time resolution is not dependent on that of weather data.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Coordination of Networked-Microgrids Toward Decentralized Operation: A Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10505017</link><description>Multiple individual microgrids can be integrated as a networked microgrid system for enhanced technical and economic performance. In this paper, a two-stage data-driven method is proposed to hierarchically coordinate individual microgrids towards decentralized operation in a networked microgrid (NMG) system. The first stage schedules active power outputs of micro-turbines and energy storage systems (ESSs) on an hourly basis for energy balancing and cost minimization, where ESSs are controlled by a local P/SoC droop scheme. In the second stage, the reactive power outputs of PV inverters are dispatched every three minutes based on a Q/V droop controller, aiming to reduce network power losses and regulate the voltage under real-time uncertainties. At offline training stage, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning model is trained to learn an optimal coordination policy, enhanced by a safety model framework. For online application, the trained agent can work locally in a decentralized manner without information exchanges, and the safety model can also be applied to monitor and guide online actions for safety compliance. Numerical test results validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Temperature-Dependent Resistance Constrained PV Accommodation Capacity Improvement Based on Multi-Objective DRL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508485</link><description>Against the backdrop of the low-carbon energy transition, distribution system operators face the urgent challenge of balancing the contradictory demands of high photovoltaic (PV) accommodation capacity and low operation cost. Meanwhile, most iteration-based PV accommodation capacity improvement methods are limited by imprecise line resistance and the conflicting relationship between decision efficiency and modeling accuracy. To this end, a two-timescale distribution network dispatching approach based on muti-objective DRL is proposed. This approach is an online decision-making method based on real-time data and robust to temperature-dependent resistance via constructing a two-stage decision-making model based on multi-objective Markov decision process considering the weather factors. Also, the proposed model has a vectorized reward function to assess the trade-off between the economy and accommodation capacity for better operation. A novel multi-objective DRL (MODRL) algorithm based on the tchebycheff norm is proposed, which decomposes the proposed decision-making model into multiple sub-models for learning Pareto optimal policies. Comparative tests on the IEEE 33-bus system validate that the proposed method effectively acquires optimization strategies under varying user preferences to improve economic and PV accommodation capacity. The proposed algorithm obtains more diverse Pareto fronts and high-quality solutions than other state-of-the-art MODRLs.</description></item><item><title>Voltage Regulation Enhanced Hierarchical Coordinated Volt/Var and Volt/Watt Control for Active Distribution Networks With Soft Open Points</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508977</link><description>The integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) into active distribution networks (ADNs) is essential for reducing carbon emissions but often results in voltage fluctuations and violations. This paper proposes a hierarchical voltage control framework that effectively coordinates diverse controllable devices with various response times in an ADN. The framework comprises three stages: day-ahead scheduling of on-load tap changer (OLTC), intra-day optimization for droop slopes and references for droop controllers in Soft Open Points (SOPs) and distributed generators (DGs), and real-time local voltage regulation. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed approach analytically establishes voltage stability constraints and incorporates them into droop slope optimization for local controllers, mitigating voltage oscillation risks. Additionally, a novel deviation-aware optimization method is developed to calculate optimal voltage references. This method treats the deviations between fixed-point voltages and their references as uncertainties and accounts for their impacts on voltage security through chance-constrained programming. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving voltage regulation performance with guaranteed stability.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Power Forecasting of Wind Farm Cluster Based on Global Information Adaptive Perceptual Graph Convolution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521869</link><description>At present, the installed capacity of wind power has increased significantly. Improving the power forecasting accuracy of Wind Farm Cluster (WFC) is of great significance to promote the consumption of renewable energy. How to effectively extract the complex spatio-temporal correlation between wind farms is the key to improve the power forecasting accuracy of WFC. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a short-term WFC power forecasting method based on global information adaptive perception graph convolution. Compared with the traditional static graph structure, this paper designs the construction method of multiple Characteristic Graph Structures (CGSs) according to the correlation between farms.

First, a novel equal energy incremental rate criterion (EEIRC) is derived, based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition, for optimally utilizing the rotor kinetic energy that can enhance the frequency regulation capability of DWTs. Next, considering the coupling characteristics of inverter-side frequency and the wind turbine motion, the necessary and sufficient condition is explored for DWTs to maintain mechanical and electrical coupling (MEC) stability as they respond to ADN frequency deviations.

Finally, comprehensive simulations are conducted on the modified IEEE 123-bus system with 100% local wind power generation to validate the effectiveness and superiorities of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Optimization and Stable Operation Control Strategy for Fractional Frequency Transmission System Based on Large Signal Stability Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10528906</link><description>Fractional frequency transmission systems perform well in offshore wind power transmission, yet analyzing the large signal stability of the whole system still remains a significant challenge. Particularly, the absence of optimized stable operation control strategy under large signal disturbances threatens the system's long-term reliability and stability. To tackle the issues, this paper develops the multiple T-S fuzzy model, incorporating equivalent models for offshore wind farms, M3C, and industrial frequency loads, and analyzes stability under large signal disturbances, considering coupling effects and interactions with different frequencies. Furthermore, to address the challenge of system inability to directly transition to a new steady-state point after encountering large signal disturbances, such as load transients, a multi-objective optimization method based on Normalized Boundary Intersection (NBI) is proposed. This method aims to solve the problem by determining one optimal intermediate transition point for the stable operation control strategy. By comprehensively considering stability margins and operational efficiency, the system adopts an optimal operational mode during transient processes to smoothly transition to the target operating point. Finally, simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of large signal stability analysis findings and the stable operation control strategies.</description></item><item><title>Development and Performance Analysis of Aquila Algorithm Optimized SPV Power Imputation and Forecasting Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10534859</link><description>Solar photovoltaic (SPV) generators play a vital role in the global pursuit of sustainable energy. However, the intermittent nature of SPV generators poses a challenge to power system planning. Accurate long-term SPV power forecasting is essential, but obtaining high-quality training dsecata for many years is cumbersome due to faults in sensors, communication, or databases, leading to missing values. This paper proposes an attention network (AN) for SPV power imputation to address missing historical data. In addition, the SPV power forecasting model using BDLSTM NN is proposed for forecasting the SPV power in the long-term horizon. During training, the weights and biases of the imputation and forecasting models are proposed to be optimized using the Aquila optimization algorithm (AOA). Training and testing results substantiate that the proposed imputation and forecasting models consistently attain superior accuracy with a reduction in training time regardless of the missing rates, climatic patterns, and seasons as compared to benchmark models.</description></item><item><title>Inertia Estimation for Microgrid Considering the Impact of Wind Conditions on Doubly-Fed Induction Generators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10534804</link><description>With wind power penetration increasing, it is crucial to accurately estimate the impact of wind power generation on grid inertia levels.

The frequency response mechanisms of a DFIG-based wind turbine (WT) are investigated across different wind speed zones. A non-synchronous inertia matrix is formulated, accounting for the impact of varying wind speeds. A Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO)-based identification method is proposed for identifying the elements of the inertia matrix. The simulation reveals that the wind speed affects the microgrid inertia response through the turbine speed control. The method can assess the risk of frequency issues and assist in the safe and stable operation of microgrids.</description></item><item><title>An Electrolyzer Model for Power System Operation Optimization Over Broad Temperature Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10463117</link><description>Electrolyzers are recognized as promising equipment to improve power systems' operation flexibility. However, existing electrolyzer models used in power system operation optimization are either nonconvex or inaccurate when operating over a broad temperature range. Hence, this letter proposes an enhanced feasible operational area of electrolyzer (EFOAE) model. The EFOAE model is the first model that is convex and accurate over a broad temperature range (0 $^{\circ }$C&#8211;80 $^{\circ }$C). Therefore, the EFOAE model is favorable for operation optimization of the power systems with high penetration of renewables. Besides, to reduce errors, this letter improves the current electrolyzer feasible operational area derivation method, and removes the infeasible part in EFOAE. Compared with existing narrow temperature range (60 $^{\circ }$C&#8211;80 $^{\circ }$C) electrolyzer models, using EFOAE may release greater flexibility for power systems' operation, thereby reducing costs by 4.6% and wind curtailment by 63% in case studies.</description></item><item><title>Droop Coefficient Design of Wind Turbine Considering Rotor Speed Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10483536</link><description>This letter provides the design rule of the droop coefficient for the power synchronization loop (PSL) based grid-forming wind turbine (WT) considering the transient rotor speed constraints. The dynamic model for PSL-based WT is established first, and it is shown that the larger the droop coefficient, the larger the steady-state rotor speed deviation is. Accordingly, the maximum droop coefficient for ensuring the existence of equilibrium is derived. Finally, with the proper scaling of the transient rotor dynamic equation, the conservative evaluation of the maximum droop coefficient is obtained to make sure the WT does not touch the lower limit of the rotor speed during disturbance.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Wind Turbines and HVDC Power Transmission Lines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531697</link><description>An innovative scheme for the direct integration of wind turbines into the existing High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission systems without the need for boost power converters and step-up transformers is presented in this article.

Such voltage difference vectors are controllable and have suitable magnitudes for integrating wind turbines into HVDC transmission lines.</description></item><item><title>Singular Perturbation-Based Large-Signal Order Reduction of Microgrids for Stability and Accuracy Synthesis With Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10412691</link><description>The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) highlights the growing importance of microgrids (MGs) in enhancing power system reliability. Employing electromagnetic transient (EMT) analysis in MGs becomes crucial for controlling the rapid transients. However, this requires an accurate but high-order model of power electronics and their underlying control loops, complexifying the stability analysis from the viewpoint of a higher control level. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a large-signal order reduction (LSOR) method for MGs with considerations of external control inputs and the detailed dynamics of underlying control levels based on singular perturbation theory (SPT). Specially, we innovatively proposed and strictly proved a general stability and accuracy assessment theorem that allows us to analyze the dynamic stability of a full-order nonlinear system by only leveraging our derived reduced-order model (ROM) and boundary layer model (BLM). Furthermore, this theorem furnishes a set of conditions that determine the accuracy of the developed ROM. Finally, by embedding such a theorem into the SPT, we propose a novel LSOR approach with guaranteed accuracy and stability analysis equivalence. Case studies are conducted on MG systems to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Event-Triggered Secondary Frequency Regulation by Sharing HESS Power in Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10413203</link><description>The fluctuated power output of renewable energy sources brings new challenges to frequency control, especially for islanded microgrids with small spinning reserves. However, energy storage systems and widespread flexible loads can be employed to the frequency regulation thanks to their flexibility of power outputs. This paper investigates the frequency regulation problem for islanded microgrids with distributed heterogeneous energy storage systems (HESS) composed of battery energy storage systems (BESS) and building thermal energy storage systems (BTESS). A distributed event-triggered balanced power sharing strategy considering denial of service (DoS) attacks is designed for frequency regulation by allocating HESS power according to BESS state of charge (SoC), BTESS state of temperature (SoT) and their capacities. The range of control parameters for a stable controller are all provided by Lyapunov analysis. Moreover, the frequency feedback control gain for HESS is derived by using linear quadratic regulator. Simulation results show that the proposed frequency regulation strategy can guarantee the recovery of microgrids frequency and the proportional sharing of HESS power. Besides, SoC and SoT balancing with fewer communications are achieved, even with considering various parameters of HESS, such as capacity, efficiency and with communication link failures as well as DoS attacks.</description></item><item><title>Control of AC-AC Interlinking Converters for Multi-Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416262</link><description>This paper considers the control of AC-AC interlinking converters (ILCs) in a multi-grid network. We overview the control schemes in the literature and propose a passivity framework for the stabilization of multi-grid networks, considering both AC grid-following and AC grid-forming behavior for the ILC connections. We then analyze a range of AC/AC interlinking converter control methods derived from the literature and propose suitable controllers for this purpose including both AC grid-forming and grid-following behavior. The controller we propose is partially grid-forming; in particular, it is based on a combination of a grid-following and a grid-forming converter to improve the stability properties of the network. Simulation results and theoretical analysis confirm that the proposed ILC control designs are appropriate for the multi-grid network.</description></item><item><title>Fuzzy Granulation Interval-Based Fault Diagnosis Method for Ring-Type DC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416239</link><description>The lack of relevant protection schemes and standards brings significant challenges to the promotion of direct current microgrid (DCMG) technologies. The existing line fault diagnosis methods usually require additional measuring devices to obtain fault signals. Although reducing the number of sensors can lower the system costs, it also increases the difficulty of diagnosis. Pole-to-pole (PP) and positive pole-to-ground (PPG) fault classification under unknown fault resistance, and negative-to-ground (NPG) fault detection under unobvious positive pole current characteristics are two major difficulties. To solve the above issues, a fuzzy granulation interval (FGI) theory-based line fault diagnosis method is proposed in this paper. Only locally measured bus-side voltage and positive pole current signals shared with the converter controller inputs are required. Firstly, the fault characteristics and diagnosis difficulties are analyzed. Then a new NPG fault index interval range (IR) is designed to extract the abnormal post-fault voltage fluctuations. Moreover, the PP/PPG fault classification strategy is designed according to the interval characteristics and capacitor discharge process. Finally, the performance of the proposed method has been evaluated through MATLAB/Simulink simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately discriminate different line faults within 1.5 ms under different fault conditions.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Evaluation of Pilot Virtual-Mesh FREEDMSs by SST Series and Three-Port Power Hub Parallel Energy Routers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423828</link><description>Integrating FREEDMS and an energy router help overcome the variability and intermittency of renewable resources for energy Internet development. Due to the developed information technology interconnection approach, energy routers are expanding with more and more multi-port topologies, which can be considered as a point-to-point connection approach. In this paper, another connection approach is proposed. On the other hand, recently, SST (series) and three-port power hub (parallel) approaches as energy routers for FREEDMS have been getting more and more attention. However, the existing literature focusing on the reliability of FREEDMS infrastructures still needs to be addressed. The FREEDMS infrastructure enhances the smart grid&#8217;s reliability and resilience to support power to communities, so its reliability evaluation is critical to determine its superiority. This paper addresses and compares the reliability evaluation of existing energy routers by SSTs and Three-Port Power Hubs. Instead of series one, the Pilot Virtual-Mesh FREEDMS infrastructure and a parallel energy router approach are proposed.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Anti-Icing and De-Icing Coordination Scheme for Resilience Enhancement in Distribution Networks Against Ice Storms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443290</link><description>Ice storms can cause serious damage to power distribution systems, thus the development of effective anti-icing and de-icing strategies is of great significance. In this article, an optimal anti-icing and de-icing coordinated operation scheme is proposed to enhance the resilience of distribution systems against ice storms, which is based on the ice-melting capacity of distribution lines. Firstly, a comprehensive risk analysis for anti-icing and de-icing in ice storms is provided. Then, a novel critical condition for anti-icing initiation is proposed based on the weather forecast deviation and potential load loss in distribution systems. On this basis, the coordinated optimization model for anti-icing and de-icing in distribution networks with intelligent soft open point and energy storage systems is established, aims at minimizing the overall load loss. Considering the double risk of overloading anti-icing and de-icing methods, the power flow limit violation function is used in the optimization model to reasonably allocate the proportion of various risks. Finally, the proposed method is verified in the IEEE 33-node distribution network.</description></item><item><title>A Coordinated Emergency Response Scheme for Electricity and Watershed Networks Considering Spatio-Temporal Heterogeneity and Volatility of Rainstorm Disasters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10422813</link><description>This paper proposes a coordinated emergency response scheme for the secure operation and mutual coordination of electricity-watershed networks under spatio-temporal heterogeneity and volatility of rainstorms. The risk interdependencies of water flooding and power outages across power distribution networks (PDNs) and watershed networks (WSNs) are formulated, and a rainstorm-triggered failure model is proposed to quantify the potential spatio-temporal outage risk of PDNs and WSNs. A hyperplane transformation based partition method is developed to extract the uneven spatial distribution and temporal variability of rainfalls. Then, a coupled electricity-watershed network model derived from Saint-Venant partial differential equations (PDEs) is formed to describe the load flow of PDNs and nonuniform hydrodynamic processes of WSNs under compounding impacts of rainstorm variability and failure occurrences. Furthermore, an optimal joint scheduling strategy is proposed to coordinate the dynamic PDN reconfiguration and WSN pump cluster drainage. In order to reduce the computational burden of original PDE-constrained emergency optimization problem, a progressive hedging-based accelerated solution algorithm combined with multiple equivalent linearization techniques is presented. Comparative results have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in reducing load shedding and mitigating flood damage losses.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Optimal Dispatch of Electricity-Natural Gas Networks Considering Natural Gas Pipeline Leakage and Linepack</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10439984</link><description>The interdependence of electricity and natural gas networks (ENGNs) has led to increased complexity and competing interests among stakeholders. In the event of a leakage failure in a natural gas pipeline, the changes in pipeline parameters pose significant challenges to the optimization and dispatch of natural gas and power grid supply systems. Hence, it would be difficult to simultaneously coordinate the respective interests and reduce the loss of load in the power grid. This paper first presents a natural gas pipeline flow model that accounts for pipeline leakage and linepack, followed by a two-stage dispatch to optimize the benefits for both electricity and natural gas suppliers, where the optimal dispatch with the worst-case scenario is linearized through mixed-integer programming (MIP). Then, a joint solution model for leakage rate and linepack is established based on the macropore leakage model and the dispatch of natural gas suppliers, considering the impact of natural gas flow rate changes on leakage parameters. The actual natural gas supply and the two-stage optimal dispatch are obtained by using the column-and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage optimal dispatch improves the power supply reliability and offers promising economic prospects for ENGNs, where the accuracy of power grid dispatch is significantly improved considering the natural gas pipeline leakage and linepack.</description></item><item><title>Defining and Characterizing Resilient Region of Interdependent Gas and Power Networks Under Extreme Events</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478308</link><description>With the increasing interconnection between gas and power networks, a small fraction of failed components caused by extreme events may trigger widespread cascading failures in an interdependent gas and power network (IGPN). A question of practical interest is how many initially failed components could break down the whole network, which can help us determine the condition for the collapse of the system. Considering that, the resilient region defined by the expected minimal fraction of initially failed components to break down the system is proposed for IGPNs to analyze the system resilience from a macroscopic perspective. To determine the resilient region, an innovative model is proposed based on the combination of percolation theory (that has been widely used in complex science) and statistical physics methods. Specifically, initial stochastic disturbances are simulated by a percolation model which progressively removes failed components from the network, and the percolation threshold (i.e., a critical fraction of failed components breaking down the network) is used as a statistical indicator for the system collapse conditions. On this basis, the boundaries of resilient regions can be characterized by the curves of the percolation threshold, and the corresponding resilience indices are developed. Considering the realistic failure propagation behaviors triggered by initial disturbances, a flow heterogeneity-driven cascading failure (FHCF) model is proposed, by which the resilient region can be computed numerically. Besides, criticality metrics are proposed to evaluate the influence of each component on the resilient region. Finally, the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on two test IGPNs, and measures to enhance the resilience of IPGNs are concluded.</description></item><item><title>Improving the Load Flexibility of Stratified Electric Water Heaters: Design and Experimental Validation of MPC Strategies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10436431</link><description>Residential electric water heaters have significant load shifting capabilities due to their thermal heat capacity and large energy consumption. Model predictive control (MPC) has been shown to be an effective control strategy to enable water heater load shifting in home energy management systems. In this work, we analyze how modeling tank stratification in an MPC formulation impacts control performance for stratified electric water heaters under time-of-use (TOU) rates. Specifically, we propose an MPC formulation based on a three-node thermal model that captures tank stratification, and compare it to a one-node formulation that does not capture stratification and a standard thermostatic controller. These strategies are compared through both real-time laboratory testing and simulation-based evaluation for different water use patterns. Laboratory experiments show cost reductions of 12.3&#8211;23.2% for the one-node MPC and 31.2&#8211;42.5% for the three-node MPC relative to the thermostatic controller. The performance of the one-node MPC is limited by significant plant-model mismatch, while the three-node formulation better approximates real-world dynamics and results in much more effective cost reduction and load shifting. A simple analysis of how each strategy performs under water use forecast errors is also provided.</description></item><item><title>A Risk Diversification Strategy for Integrated Demand Response Under Imperfect Rationality</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10444038</link><description>Integrated demand response (IDR) is acknowledged as a cost-effective and low-carbon tool that helps alleviate imbalances between energy supply and demand in energy systems. However, the imperfect rationality of consumers can lead to a series of new issues, such as cognitive characteristics of bounded rationality as well as irrationality, subjective uncertainty, and correlated risks. This paper proposes an improved consumer model by using a dynamic subjective weight function with a rationality degree indicator to cope with cognitive characteristics, coupled with a deduced skew distribution modelling the subjective uncertainty. Besides, MESP model is also improved to deal with the correlated risks by managing the diversification level of risks that is defined based on Shannon entropy. The mathematical formulation of the proposed model is expressed as a bi-level stochastic optimization problem, which is equivalently converted into a single-objective optimization problem to be solved efficiently. Simulation results validate advantages of our model in enhancing the accuracy of consumer behavior prediction, effectiveness of incentive strategies, diversification level of response risks, which contributes to achieve a win-win situation between consumers and MESP by decreasing not only total response power deviation as well as cumulative response risks of MESP but also consumer&#8217;s discomfort level.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Fault Modeling of Droop-Controlled IIDG and its Cluster</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10409553</link><description>Fault modeling of inverter-interfaced distributed generators (IIDGs) is the basis of power system fault calculation and protection scheme design. Due to its inherent properties and flexible control strategy, analyzing the transient-state fault responses of droop-controlled IIDG is difficult, and an analytical fault model has yet to be proposed. This work establishes a controlled voltage source-based fault equivalent model of droop-controlled IIDG in synchronous reference frame to address this research gap. The impacts of droop characteristics, virtual impedance, double-closed-loop controller, current limiting, and low-voltage-ride-through requirements are all considered, and the obtained model can cover both the transient- and steady-state fault responses. An IIDG clustering method based on the equivalent admittance matrix of the grid is also proposed, which lays the groundwork for model reduction. A corresponding model aggregation method is then provided. With this, the complexity of fault analysis for peer-to-peer controlled distributed power systems can be significantly reduced. The scheme proposed in this paper is verified by simulation experiments in PSCAD/EMTDC software.</description></item><item><title>Agri-Energy-Environment Synergy-Based Distributed Energy Planning in Rural Areas</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10430377</link><description>Rural passive distribution networks can no longer meet the modern agricultural electrification and cleanliness requirements, and it is urgent to carry out distributed energy planning construction in rural areas. This paper studies the theoretical and methodological aspects of distributed energy planning in rural areas considering crop growth mechanisms. In light of the effects of agricultural load control on agricultural production, we have created a facility-based agricultural load control model rooted in crop physiological ecology. The proposed model encompasses electric irrigation, high-pressure sodium lighting and heating loads. In response to the impact of agricultural load control on carbon emissions in the energy system, carbon cycling within the agricultural and energy systems has been analyzed and modeled. Considering the significant differences in greenhouse load requirements at different growth stages of different crops, the distributed energy planning model is established based on representative daily profiles that reflect typical crop growth patterns. The proposed model constraints encompass constraints related to the healthy growth of crops and constraints within the energy system, with the optimization goal set to minimize the 15-year planning cost. We validate the planning model by applying it to a case study involving a rural energy system in Hebei Province, China, with an annual electricity consumption of 5,600,376 kWh. The adoption of this model led to a cost reduction of  $7.3\times 10^{{ 5}}$  CNY compared to conventional planning methods. The collaborative synergy between agriculture, energy, and the environment manifested in an annual carbon reduction benefit (ACRB) of  $1.7\times 10^{{ 4}}$ CNY from photovoltaic generation and an ACRB of  $1.2\times 10^{{ 4}}$  CNY from greenhouse gas absorption.</description></item><item><title>A Bandwidth-Conscious Event-Based Control Approach to Secondary Frequency Regulation Under Vehicle-to-Grid Service</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433821</link><description>This paper addresses the problem of communication resource-efficient secondary frequency regulation of power grids under vehicle-to-grid supplementary service. First, an event-based frequency regulation framework is established for power grids incorporated with electric vehicle (EV) participation, enabling system performance analysis and control design under event-based communication. The framework also takes into account the EV aggregator dynamics with battery charging/discharging processes under practical travel demands. Second, a novel resource-efficient event-based broadcast mechanism (REBM) is developed for intelligent transmissions of command signals from the dispatch center to the power plant and distributed EV aggregators. By deciding the broadcast actions with the particular consideration of the real-time bandwidth occupancy, the designed REBM is capable to flexibly adapt the command transmission rate to variable network status. Then, a co-design approach to the desired REBM and frequency controller is derived, based on which an implementation algorithm is provided for achieving satisfying secondary frequency regulation performance with enhanced communication efficiency. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed approach is verified through comparative case studies.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Planning of Standalone Net-Zero Energy Systems With Small Modular Reactors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433761</link><description>Renewable-based standalone systems are widely developed worldwide with the decentralization of power and energy systems. However, challenges are posed due to the intermittent nature of renewable resources and the lack of inertia. Small modular reactors (SMRs), a clean but also flexible and controllable energy, can be deployed to provide flexibility and inertia support to standalone energy systems with high penetration of renewable energy. In this paper, we propose a novel standalone net-zero energy system planning scheme that coordinates SMRs with other distributed energy resources, where both steady-state operation constraints and dynamic frequency security constraints are considered to guarantee the operational feasibility of the plan. Since the dynamics of SMR are very complex, the planning model becomes a complex and unanalytical optimization problem. To this end, we first develop a physics-informed data-driven approach to model the dynamic frequency characteristics of SMRs with high accuracy. On this basis, we propose a &#8220;checking and adjusting&#8221; heuristic approach to iteratively solve a series of MILP problems without the non-linear and unanalytical frequency constraint and then check whether the constraint can be satisfied. In this way, we can get a feasible and suboptimal solution in a tractable manner. Comprehensive case studies have been conducted, and results show that the inclusion of SMRs can substantially increase the flexibility and frequency security of standalone net-zero energy systems.</description></item><item><title>Joint Planning of Utility-Owned Distributed Energy Resources in an Unbalanced Active Distribution Network Considering Asset Health Degradation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10436425</link><description>Rapid integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in active distribution networks (ADNs) necessitates advanced planning methods to optimally determine the size, site, and installation time of DERs. However, existing approaches often assume balanced networks and neglect health degradation of DER assets, limiting the accuracy and practicality of the planning results. This paper proposes a new planning method for utility-owned distributed generators (DGs) and energy storage systems (ESSs) in an unbalanced ADN considering asset health degradation. First, the three-phase branch flow is modeled for unbalanced characteristics of ADNs, and host DERs separately in different phases. Then, based on the Wiener degradation process, the aging path of each DG unit is modeled to estimate its available capacity along with service time; the ESS aging is modeled to reflect the degradation cost during charging and discharging. Finally, a copula-based stochastic programming method is presented considering the correlations between renewables and power demands. The inclusion of market volatility in electricity price uncertainty further enhances planning realism. Numerical case studies on an IEEE-34 bus three-phase ADN demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>MADP-Based Explicit Online Operation Policy for Robust Energy Management of ADN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10453347</link><description>This paper proposes a multiparametric approximate dynamic programming (MADP)-based explicit online operation policy for the robust energy management problem of active distribution network (ADN). First, the online energy management problem is described from the perspective of distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Then, the risk-averse concept is introduced to quantitatively control the conservativeness of DRO. Considering that it is a complex online optimal problem, which is intractable for traditional algorithms, an MADP-based explicit online operation policy is proposed in this paper. Specifically, the approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm is improved based on the multiparametric programming theory, according to which an explicit online operation policy can be further derived. Compared to traditional online decision-making policies, which need to execute an optimization program, the proposed policy is able to directly obtain solutions through an explicit expression. In this way, the calculation efficiency can be enhanced significantly. Cases on several test systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Interaction Dynamics Analysis and Active Stabilization of a Weak Grid-Tied Hybrid PV-Wind Power Generator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10466715</link><description>This paper addresses the dynamic stability of a hybrid photovoltaic (PV) and wind turbine (WT) system tied to a weak grid by back-to-back voltage-source converters (VSCs). The overall system stability is assessed by developing a detailed time-domain nonlinear model (TDNLM) and a linearized state-space model (LSSM). The dynamic interactions at both the peak-power point (PPP) and off-PPP operation of the PV and WT power characteristics curves have been examined. The results reveal that the complete system is stable under PV-only and WT-only generation scenarios at the PPP and off-PPP operation regions. However, the PV-WT hybrid system experiences low- and high-frequency fluctuation instabilities in the current-limited region (CLR) of the PV characteristic due to the interaction between the high dynamic resistances of the PV-WT source and the weak grid. Conversely, the system remains stable at the PPP and voltage-limited region (VLR) of the PV characteristic and in all operational regions of the WT characteristic. Motivated by these challenges, a novel active damping method is proposed to mitigate the interaction dynamics, maintaining overall system stability by relocating unstable eigenmodes and reshaping the dc-link transfer function. The proposed damping method offers several benefits: 1) it is simple yet efficient and can be implemented and modeled using linear analysis tools; 2) it allows for dynamic and stable operation across various operating regions; 3) it does not interfere with steady-state performance in both stiff and weak grid operations; 4) it facilitates successful low-voltage-ride-through (LVRT) at different operating regions; and 5) it effectively addresses its shortcomings by eliminating the need for additional voltage or current sensors, thereby enhancing simplicity and reducing cost in comparison to other approaches. Detailed offline and real-time simulations validate the analytical findings and the effectiveness of the proposed stabilization method under different operational scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Clusters Supported Bi-Level Control System With Lower Communication Requirements for a Distribution Network With Distributed Battery and Photovoltaic Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475702</link><description>This paper proposes a bi-level control framework for dynamic microgrid clusters in a distribution network with distributed photovoltaic and battery storage systems. The proposed bi-level control framework comprises interactive secondary and tertiary level control systems. A distributed event-triggered mechanism is proposed for the secondary level control of each dynamic microgrid cluster to achieve frequency and voltage regulation and balancing of the state of charge of battery storage systems within the cluster. At the tertiary level, a receding horizon model predictive control is implemented to minimize transmission power losses and battery storage systems losses by providing optimal battery storage systems output powers and the voltage source converters output voltages, with a one-minute interval. The secondary level control is modified to implement the optimal solutions provided by the tertiary level model predictive control. Furthermore, the secondary level distributed event-triggered control minimizes unnecessary data transmission by introducing a time delay, resulting in a reduced communication burden. The proposed bi-level control framework is validated in real-time on a modified IEEE 13-node test feeder using RTDS with the tertiary level model predictive control solved on a computer via the hardware-in-loop method.</description></item><item><title>A Contextually Supervised Optimization-Based HVAC Load Disaggregation Methodology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10440142</link><description>This paper presents a novel contextually supervised optimization-based approach for disaggregating heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) loads using smart meter or Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition data. To disaggregate the load into HVAC loads, large and infrequently used loads (LIUL), and base loads, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize a set of five loss terms, consisting of the reconstruction errors of the overall load profile, the ramp rate losses, and three distinct loss functions linked with the HVAC load, base load, and LIUL, respectively. To enhance accuracy, we incorporate two forms of contextual information into the problem formulation. First, we utilize mutual information to estimate HVAC energy consumption. Second, we employ a base load dictionary to constrain HVAC load estimation errors. The obtained HVAC load profiles are fine-tuned by abnormal ramp detection followed by binary hypothesis testing. The proposed method is developed and tested using sub-metered residential and commercial building data. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods across various data resolutions and load aggregation levels, showing excellent transferability and generalizability.</description></item><item><title>Electric Vehicles Charging Time Constrained Deliverable Provision of Secondary Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10411057</link><description>Aggregation of electric vehicles (EVs) is a promising technique for providing secondary frequency regulation (SFR) in highly renewable energy-penetrated power systems. Equipped with energy storage devices, EV aggregation can provide reliable SFR. However, the main challenge is to guarantee reliable intra-interval SFR capacities and inter-interval delivery following the automatic generation control (AGC) signal. Furthermore, aggregated EV SFR provision will be further complicated by the EV charging time anxiety because SFR provision might extend EV&#8217;s charging time. This paper proposes a deliverable EV SFR provision with a charging-time-constrained control strategy. First, a charging-time-constrained EV aggregation is proposed to address the uncertainty of EV capacity based on the state-space model considering the charging-time restriction of EV owners. Second, a real-time economic dispatch and time domain simulation (RTED-TDS) cosimulation framework is proposed to verify financial results and the dynamic performance of the EV SFR provision. Last, the proposed charging time-constrained EV aggregation is validated on the IEEE 39-bus system. The results demonstrate that with charging time-constrained EV aggregation, the dynamic performance of the system can be improved with a marginal increase in total cost. More importantly, the charging time constraint can be respected in the proposed SFR provision of the EV aggregation.</description></item><item><title>An Enhanced SD-GS-AL Algorithm for Coordinating the Optimal Power and Traffic Flows With EVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415053</link><description>The electric power distribution network (PDN) and the transportation network (TN) are generally operated/coordinated by different entities. However, they are coupled through electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs). This paper proposes to coordinate the operation of the two systems via a fully decentralized framework where the PDN and TN operators solve their own operation problems independently, with only limited information exchange. Nevertheless, the operation problems of both systems are generally mixed-integer programs (MIP), for which mature algorithms like the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) may not guarantee convergence. This paper applies a novel distributed optimization algorithm called the SD-GS-AL method, which is a combination of the simplicial decomposition, gauss-seidel, and augmented Lagrangian, which can guarantee convergence and optimality for MIPs. However, the original SD-GS-AL may be computationally inefficient for solving a complex engineering problem like the PDN-TN coordinated optimization investigated in this paper. To improve the computational efficiency, an enhanced SD-GS-AL method is proposed by redesigning the inner loop of the algorithm, which can automatically and intelligently determine the iteration number of the inner loop. Simulations on the test cases show the efficiency and efficacy of the proposed framework and algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Graph Reinforcement Learning for Carbon-Aware Electric Vehicles in Power-Transport Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415871</link><description>Transitioning towards a low-carbon future necessitates massive efforts from both the transport and power sectors. Electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a promising approach to realize this objective, leveraging their smart routing strategies and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) techniques. Previous studies have addressed various challenges in EV routing and scheduling through model-based optimization methods while ignoring the system uncertainties and dynamics. This paper focuses on studying the carbon-aware EV joint routing and scheduling problem within a coupled power-transport network that can enable EV recharging behaviors within the transport network while concurrently delivering carbon-intensity services within the power network. Specifically, a carbon emission flow model is introduced as a mechanism for tracing and calculating the nodal carbon intensity signals tailored for EVs to provide their carbon services. To solve this problem, we propose a model-free multi-agent reinforcement learning method that harnesses graph convolutional networks to capture essential network features and employs a parameter-sharing framework to learn large-scale control policies. The efficacy and scalability of the proposed method in achieving cost-effective and low-carbon transitions are verified through case studies involving two power-transport networks with 100 and 1,000 EVs, respectively.</description></item><item><title>DiffCharge: Generating EV Charging Scenarios via a Denoising Diffusion Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418170</link><description>Recent proliferation of electric vehicle (EV) charging load has imposed vital stress on power grid. The stochasticity and volatility of EV charging behaviors render it challenging to manipulate the uncertain charging demand for grid operations and charging management. Charging scenario generation can serve for future EV integration by modeling charging load uncertainties and simulating various realistic charging sessions. To this end, we propose a denoising Diffusion-based Charging scenario generation model coined DiffCharge, which is capable of yielding both battery-level and station-level EV charging time-series data with distinct temporal properties. In principle, the devised model can progressively convert the simply known Gaussian noise to genuine charging demand profiles by learning a parameterized reversal of the forward diffusion process. Besides, we leverage the multi-head self-attention mechanism and prior conditions to capture the unique temporal correlations associated with battery or charging station types in actual charging dynamics. Moreover, we validate the superior generative capacity of DiffCharge on a real-world dataset involving ample charging session records, and attest the efficacy of produced charging scenarios on a practical EV operation problem in the day-ahead electricity market.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Dynamic Pricing of Fast Charging Stations Considering Bounded Rationality of Users and Market Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423379</link><description>Electric vehicles (EVs), as popular transportation carriers and flexible electric loads, couple both the power distribution networks and transportation networks. The pricing schemes of fast charging stations significantly affects the EVs&#8217; on-tirp charging behaviors and the operations of coupled power and transportation networks. This interdisciplinary paper proposes an optimal dynamic pricing method for fast charging stations to boost charging network operator&#8217; (CNO&#8217;s) profits and avoid excessive charging costs of EVs. Time-varying traffic flow and charging demands are generated by a dynamic traffic assignment simulation, where a boundedly rational dynamic user equilibrium model is presented to capture the cost sensitivity of EVs and gasoline vehicle users. Additionally, a market regulator supervises the CNO&#8217;s pricing, balancing the interests of the CNO and users via a regulation constraint. To address the optimal dynamic pricing issue, we propose a three-level Stackelberg game involving the distribution network operator, CNO, and users. The existence of a game equilibrium is assured by the fixed-point theory. A Gauss-Seidel iteration algorithm with inertia weight is designed to solve the pricing problem. The numerical results have corroborated the effectiveness of the proposed method, illuminating the effects of bounded rationality and market regulation on the CNO&#8217;s profits and users&#8217; travel costs.</description></item><item><title>A Robust V2G Voltage Control Scheme for Distribution Networks Against Cyber Attacks and Customer Interruptions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433072</link><description>A decent vehicle-to-grid (V2G) control scheme improves voltage stability and grid reliability of distribution networks (DNs) by providing reactive power and ancillary services. However, unknown malicious attacks in cyber layers and uncertain EV charging/unplugging in physical layers will disturb the measurement process, leading to controller parameters&#8217; mismatching and severe voltage violations. This paper proposes a robust V2G voltage control scheme for DNs investigating cyber attacks and EV customer interruptions. Firstly, the impact of cyber attacks is characterized by time-varying uncertain matrices function with Lebesgur measurable elements, while the EV customer interruptions are represented by Signum variables. Then, a new state-space equation for V2G voltage control in DNs is constructed by incorporating above matrices function and Signum variables. Moreover, a robust voltage controller is proposed for measurement disordered V2G systems to suppress voltage violations while achieving  $H_{\infty }$  performance. By utilizing linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques, sufficient conditions for system closed-loop exponentially mean-square stability and the controller parameter tuning are presented. Case studies conducted on modified IEEE European low voltage test feeder compare two voltage deviation indices of the proposed controller with those of existing methods, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed approach against measurement anomalies.</description></item><item><title>Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional-Based Recurrent Network for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations Demand Forecasting in Energy Market</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10445239</link><description>The increasing adoption of electric vehicles has led to new and unpredictable load conditions for electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs), making charging demand forecasting important to the profitable deployment of EVCSs. Although existing spatial-temporal forecasting models have made significant progress, they ignore the realistic topologies of EVCS networks and the influence of external interference on charging demand. Moreover, limited research exists on developing forecasting models from the perspective of EVCSs participating in the energy market. This paper proposes a novel parallel-structured spatiotemporal mutual residual graph convolution-combined bi-long short-term memory for predicting the charging demand of EVCSs. First, a new mutual adjacency matrix considering both the static and dynamic attributes of EVCSs is constructed. This matrix is then combined with graph convolution and residual blocks to capture multi-level spatial dependencies and map relations between nodes and external factors. Second, to address temporal dependencies, CBi-LSTM combining Bi-LSTM with an additional predictor that considers day-type tendency features is developed. Finally, a parallel structure is adopted to obtain the final prediction results and preserve the integrity of spatiotemporal dependencies. Case studies validated the performance of the proposed model, which demonstrated high forecasting accuracy and the potential for profitable application in the energy market.</description></item><item><title>Resilient Resource Allocations for Multi-Stage Transportation-Power Distribution System Operations in Hurricanes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10445529</link><description>The resilience of distribution networks (DNs) or transportation networks (TNs) has attracted a wide attention due to the frequent occurrence of extreme natural disasters. However, the existing works usually investigate the resilience of two systems independently, which neglects their coordinated operations. This paper models the interactions of DNs and TNs and coordinates multiple resilience enhancement strategies to make a more cost-effective resource allocation scheme for the operation of transportation-power distribution networks (TDNs) in hurricanes. Specifically, resource allocations and TDN operations are designed as a two-stage mixed-integer stochastic programming (TMISP) model, where the first stage is to make resource allocation decisions before the hurricane strikes, and the second stage is to perform multi-stage resilience enhancement strategies to minimize the expected TDN operational losses. The uncertain TDN outages with defensive resources in hurricanes are modeled as decision-dependent uncertainties, which are decoupled into decision-independent uncertainties for generating TDN outage scenarios. A comprehensive scenario reduction method is utilized to reduce the redundancies in simulated scenarios. The penalty-based Gauss-Seidel approach is combined with a scenario-skip technique to solve the TMISP problem with binary variables in both stages. Numerical simulations show that the proposed solution methods provide superior performances in computational efficiency and accuracy, over the traditional scenario reduction and scenario-wise decomposition algorithms in solving the TMISP problem. The investment efficiency is increased with the coordination of various DN and TN resources and multiple resilience enhancement strategies, compared with those of separate allocation schemes.</description></item><item><title>Market-Level Integrated Detection Against Cyber Attacks in Real-Time Market Operations by Self-Supervised Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10426800</link><description>The increasing integration of information and communication technologies into power grids makes the coupling between cyber and physical power system operations intricate. Along with the deregulation of energy markets, there is an increased potential opportunity for cyber attacks, challenging the effectiveness of current cyber protection methods. In a real-time electricity market, attackers can utilize various kinds of cyber attacks to cause significant financial losses and create catastrophic consequences for grid operations. Therefore, detecting cyber attacks in the real-time market is crucial. However, most of the existing detection methods are primarily designed to identify a single type of attack. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of research focused on developing market-level detection methods against cyber attacks based on market-level behaviors. To fill the above gap, in this paper a novel self-supervised learning based method is proposed to detect multiple types of cyber attacks by analyzing real-time locational marginal prices (RTLMPs) data. Specifically, an autoencoder-enhanced generative adversarial network (GAN)-based method is proposed to examine the spatial-temporal correlations of RTLMPs, and determine whether the RTLMPs are compromised by the attackers or not. Finally, Midcontinent Independent System Operator data are employed for case studies, and simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed data-driven method.</description></item><item><title>Risk-Sensitive Mobile Battery Energy Storage System Control With Deep Reinforcement Learning and Hybrid Risk Estimation Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415092</link><description>The mobile battery energy storage systems (MBESS) utilize flexibility in temporal and spatial to enhance smart grid resilience and economic benefits. Recently, the high penetration of renewable energy increases the volatility of electricity prices and gives MBESS an opportunity for price difference arbitrage. However, the strong randomness of both the traffic system and renewable energy leads to difficulty in achieving profit with acceptable risk. To address this problem, this paper proposes a risk-sensitive MBESS control framework based on safe deep reinforcement learning, which can constrain the risk under a certain level according to the company&#8217;s risk preference. The risk-estimation safe deep deterministic policy gradient (RE-SDDPG) algorithm is proposed to learn the optimal policy under the premise of lacking direct risk signals. Moreover, a hybrid risk estimation method is proposed to avoid local convergence caused by inaccurate estimation during the learning process. Last, a parameter-sharing method is applied to increase learning efficiency by sharing the Q networks&#8217; parameters. The proposed methods are tested in the IEEE 30-bus system. The results show that the proposed method can keep the profit at a relatively high level while reducing the risk and increase learning efficiency compared with existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Cyber-Resilience of Power Systems&#8217; AGC Sensor Data by Time Series to Image Domain Encoding</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418545</link><description>The shift to wide area networks (WANs) in power systems has introduced security challenges. While research has focused on attack detection, adversaries can outsmart even advanced anomaly detectors. Further, existing techniques fail to ensure data confidentiality, exposing telemetered data to eavesdropping. To address these evolving threats, we propose a novel framework to enhance power system data communication security over WANs. This innovative approach combines time series to image transformation, digital watermarking, and machine learning. These elements collaboratively encode sensor data into an unintelligible format, maintaining operational impact. We begin by converting time-series data into images with the Gramian Angular Field algorithm. These images are subtly embedded with invisible watermarks. The framework introduces an additional security layer to detect image tampering during communication. Using an Autoencoder-Support Vector Regression model, we restore the watermarked images to the original time series. Notably, the watermarking method is system-independent, maintains sensor data confidentiality, and certifies data integrity. In time-critical power system operations, traditional encryption and authentication can introduce latency. The proposed approach minimizes computational overhead and ensures real-time responsiveness, effectively securing power system data communications. To demonstrate the proposed framework&#8217;s effectiveness, experiments were conducted on the IEEE-39 bus system&#8217;s Automatic Generation Control system.</description></item><item><title>Data Protection Method Against Cross-Domain Inference Threat in Cyber&#8211;Physical Power Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423301</link><description>Recent advancement of data-driven methods has enabled the mining of associations among various data sets, particularly those generated from cyber-physical power grids (CPPG) where different measurements may be inherently coupled by an underlying system. As such, attackers may infer sensitive parameters jointly from several publicly shared electricity data across different security domains based on their revealed associations. Traditional data protection methods, mainly focusing on reducing the risks of direct data probing, may not be applicable to properly guard sensitive information in such scenarios. In this paper, we elaborate on such a data security issue, namely cross-domain inference (CDI), and then propose the decoder-ensemble variational autoencoder (DE-VAE) which is used for noise-adding to protect against such attack. The DE-VAE is designed with a mutual information maximization scheme to preserve the original usability of the noise-added data. Meanwhile, a multi-objective optimization is solved to achieve a trade-off between privacy protection and data usability. Our protection method is evaluated on experiments involving four real-world scenarios in the modern sensor-rich smart power grid. The experimental results show that our method can provide effective protection ability against CDI threats without sacrificing much usability, and achieves a performance gain of more than 45% compared to several non-trivial baselines.</description></item><item><title>DAMGAT-Based Interpretable Detection of False Data Injection Attacks in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433005</link><description>False data injection attacks (FDIAs) significantly disrupt the secure operation of smart grids by manipulating the measured values collected by intelligent instruments. Existing studies have utilized deep learning techniques to enhance the detection of FDIAs, however, these studies often overlook the spatial correlation between power grid topology and measurement data. Meanwhile, the high complexity of deep neural network severely impedes the interpretability of detection models, resulting in the incredibility of detection results. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes an interpretable deep learning FDIAs detection method, named dual-attention multi-head graph attention network, DAMGAT. The DAMGAT introduces a dual-attention mechanism that incorporates both node feature attention and spatial topology attention into a multi-head graph attention network. This mechanism efficiently aggregates attack characteristics and spatial topology information by dynamically capturing the potential correlations between FDIAs detection and measurement data. Furthermore, the proposed model can provide clear and credible interpretations for high-accuracy detection results via analyzing features and spatial topology attention weights. Extensive simulations are performed using the IEEE 14-bus and 118-bus test systems. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art FDIA detection methods in terms of accuracy, while also providing reasonable interpretability for features and spatial dimensions.</description></item><item><title>FDI Attack Estimation and Event-Triggered Resilient Control of DC Microgrids Under Hybrid Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443300</link><description>In this paper, false-data-injection (FDI) attack estimation and event-triggered resilient control of DC microgrid (DC-MG) systems under FDI and denial-of-service (DoS) hybrid attacks are studied. In order to describe more general DoS attack characteristics, a time-constrained DoS attack (TCDA) model is established. This model only requires attack duration information compared to the classic DoS model. Based on the above TCDA model, a new event-based switching DC-MG system model with FDI attack compensation is established by using pulse observer, event-triggered mechanism and switching state feedback control law. In addition, by using the piecewise time-varying Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method related to the attack parameters, the sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of the closed-loop system are given. More importantly, a joint design scheme of event-based state feedback controller and FDI observer is proposed to realize FDI attack estimation and event-triggered resilient control under hybrid attacks of DC-MG. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed joint design scheme is demonstrated through the experimental study of DC-MG with two constant power loads.</description></item><item><title>A Monolithic Cybersecurity Architecture for Power Electronic Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443303</link><description>Power electronic systems (PES) face significant threats from various data availability and integrity attacks, significantly affecting the performance of communication networks and power system operation. As a result, several attack detection and reconstruction techniques are deployed, which makes it a costly &amp; complex cybersecurity operational platform with significant room for incremental extensions for mitigation against future threats. Unlike the said traditional arrangements, our paper introduces a foundational approach by establishing a monolithic cybersecurity architecture (MCA) via incorporating semantic principles into the sampling process for distributed energy resources (DERs). This unified approach concurrently compensates for the intrusion challenges posed by cyber attacks by reconstructing signals using the dynamics of the inner control layer. This reconstruction considers essential semantic attributes, like Priority, Freshness, and Relevance to ensure resilient dynamic performance. Hence, the proposed scheme promises a generalized route to concurrently tackle a global set of cyber attacks in elevating the resilience of PES. Finally, rigorous validation on a modified IEEE 69-bus distribution system and a real-world South California Edison (SCE) 47-bus network, using OPAL-RT under diverse operating conditions, underscores its robustness, model-free design capability, scalability, and adaptability to dynamic cyber graphs and system reconfiguration.</description></item><item><title>Wide Area Measurement-Based Cyber-Attack-Resilient Breaker Failure Protection Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10458870</link><description>Breaker Failure Protection trips the backup breakers when the primary breaker fails, causing a significant loss of load. Hence, a cyber-attack on the Breaker Failure Protection scheme may lead to major disturbance in a power system. Currently, there is a lack of literature addressing the cyber-attack on Breaker Failure Protection scheme. This paper proposes a novel Wide Area Measurement-based cyber-attack-resilient Breaker Failure Protection scheme. Modern digital relays have Phasor Measurement Unit (PMU) integrated with them. A digital relay with PMU functionality is called Relay-PMU in this work. The proposed scheme has two parts. Part 1 is named as Synchrophasor-based Fault Validation Algorithm. It checks whether the Breaker Failure Protection operation is genuine or due to a cyber-attack. Breaker Failure Protection Relay-PMU will trigger the Part 1 of the proposed scheme which runs in a Phasor Data Concentrator. A novel concept named Dynamic Relay White-listing is proposed to avoid the usage of phasors from the susceptible Relay-PMUs. Part 2 is the modifications to the logics of the existing common Breaker Failure Protection schemes to incorporate the decision from the Synchrophasor-based Fault Validation Algorithm. The proposed scheme is computationally efficient and compatible with all common Breaker Failure Protection schemes. PSCAD simulations of the IEEE-118 bus system validate the proposed scheme. The execution time of the proposed scheme in the lab implementation setup adheres to the timeline of the Breaker Failure Protection scheme.</description></item><item><title>Customized Load Profiles Synthesis for Electricity Customers Based on Conditional Diffusion Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10438078</link><description>Customers&#8217; load profiles are critical resources to support data analytics applications in modern power systems. However, there are usually insufficient historical load profiles for data analysis, due to the collection cost and data privacy issues. To address such data shortage problems, load profiles synthesis is an effective technique that provides synthetic training data for customers to build high-performance data-driven models. Nonetheless, it is still challenging to synthesize high-quality load profiles for each customer using generation models trained by the respective customer&#8217;s data owing to the high heterogeneity of customer load. In this paper, we propose a novel customized load profiles synthesis method based on conditional diffusion models for heterogeneous customers. Specifically, we first convert the customized synthesis into a conditional data generation issue. We then extend traditional diffusion models to conditional diffusion models to realize conditional data generation, which can synthesize exclusive load profiles for each customer according to the customer&#8217;s load characteristics and application demands. In addition, to implement conditional diffusion models, we design a noise estimation model with stacked residual layers, which improves the generation performance by using skip connections. The attention mechanism is also utilized to better extract the complex temporal dependency of load profiles. Finally, numerical case studies based on a public dataset are conducted to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>LDM: A Generic Data-Driven Large Distribution Network Operation Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10498082</link><description>With the growing intelligence of power grids, the application of data-driven AI technologies has been widely studied in distribution network (DN) control and operation. However, most existing studies can only address a specific task. The recent surge of powerful, versatile AI models has inspired us to explore whether the grid controller can also evolve toward greater intelligence, enabling it to perform multiple DN operation tasks. To this end, this letter proposes a novel generic data-driven Large Distribution network operation Model (LDM) based on multitask reinforcement learning (MTRL). It can concurrently learn multiple DN operation skills and perform distinct tasks separately. Specifically, to effectively handle the unaligned heterogeneous action spaces across different tasks, action-masking is incorporated. Case studies on a modified 33-bus system prove the generalization capabilities of LDM.</description></item><item><title>An Integrated Framework of Lateral and Longitudinal Behavior Decision-Making for Autonomous Driving Using Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472707</link><description>Lateral lane-changing and longitudinal car-following behavior decision-making is crucial for the implementation of autonomous driving (AD) in complex and dynamic traffic environment. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been increasingly applied to these behaviors due to its powerful environmental adaptability. However, typical RL-based research focused solely on one directional decision-making or output discrete actions in both lateral and longitudinal directions, which is not sufficiently flexible for AD. In view of the close interaction between lane-changing and car-following tasks, this study proposed an integrated framework to realize coupled decision-making using RL. Specifically, double deep Q-network (DDQN) was used to make the lateral lane change command decision-making, and twin delay deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) used to make longitudinal car-following acceleration decision-making. The integration of DDQN and TD3 was deployed to tackle the problem of discrete-continuous hybrid action space in RL. The lateral decision-making was integrated into the actor-critic network for longitudinal decision-making to generate accurate acceleration in lane-changing or lane-keeping conditions. A series of simulation experiments were conducted in typical two-lane straight driving scenarios, validating the feasibility and applicability of the proposed integrated framework. The results reveal that the RL-based coupled decision-making helps enhance the implementation of AD.</description></item><item><title>Aerodynamics-Based Collision-Free Control of Connected Drones in Complex Urban Low-Altitude Airspace Using Distributional Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10494776</link><description>Recent growth in the number of drones has made traffic management unworkable, particularly in urban areas. The safe operation and optimized navigation of drone swarms are now growing concerns. In this article, we use distributional reinforcement learning to prevent drone collisions via aerodynamic acceleration and deceleration. Although the instantaneous acceleration or deceleration of drones during an encounter influences drone kinematics, we note that drone kinematics itself can prevent collisions via instantaneous acceleration or deceleration. This article's central question, then, is how to take drone kinematics into account to improve air traffic intersection flow performance. First, the intercommunication between drone swarms is established via an Internet of drones to send and receive the current state of each drone in the swarm and detect potential collisions. In the presence of obstacles, we first use distributional reinforcement learning to find the inevitable change in kinematic height and guide descents and ascents through air traffic intersections. Here, the drone's energy consumption during instantaneous acceleration or deceleration cannot be ignored. A properly designed speed control is crucial to the power management of the drone. Distributional reinforcement learning is used to control drone acceleration and deceleration to avoid collision risk while minimizing energy consumption according to the reference energy recorded by each drone. We flew drones to gather energy consumption data and, to validate our approach, we subsequently conducted simulations in which travel time and energy consumption were measured. We demonstrate that the proposed kinematics-based drone collision avoidance method exhibits excellent performance in terms of travel time and power management.</description></item><item><title>Approximate Optimal Adaptive Prescribed Performance Fault-Tolerant Control for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle Based on Self-Organizing Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10484982</link><description>This paper investigates the problem of performance-optimized fault-tolerant tracking control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with unknown disturbances and actuator faults. To ensure the prescribed tracking accuracy and save the consumption of control inputs, the prescribed performance function is used to constrain the tracking error, and a performance optimization strategy is designed to plan the virtual control inputs based on the optimized cost function. To deal with the uncertainties caused by unknown disturbances and additive faults, the self-organizing neural network (NN) is employed to estimate these composite unknown dynamics. The structure of the NN can be dynamically adapted according to the complexity of the fitted function, which avoids excessive computational burden. A fault-tolerant estimation law is designed to minimize the impact of AUVs when they are subject to actuator partial multiplicative faults, and the actual fault-tolerant controller is designed based on the dynamic event triggering strategy, which reduces the updating frequency of the control inputs while guaranteeing the safe operation of the system. The proposed control framework enables the AUV to ensure the prescribed tracking accuracy during the tracking process, improving tracking safety and reducing energy consumption for accomplishing the task. Finally, a simulation experiment verifies the effectiveness of the designed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Co-Optimization of Velocity Planning and Energy Management for Intelligent Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles Based on Adaptive Dynamic Programming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10487899</link><description>Intelligent plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (IPHEVs), with advanced environmental sensing and integrated communication capabilities, present tremendous autonomy in drive decision-making and high efficiency in energy economy. In this context, the key control of IPHEVs gradually evolves from energy management among the key components of powertrain to the co-operative velocity planning and energy management, which, nonetheless, are strongly coupled. To tackle it, an intelligent strategy based on adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) is explored to online co-optimize the longitudinal traction and energy management of IPHEV, especially in vehicle-following scenarios. The imbedded cooperative critic and actor networks are constructed to endow the ADP with satisfactory learning capability and calculation speed. The instantaneous reward integrating the nonlinear characteristics of IPHEV powertrain is designed for online learning of critic and actor networks. Substantial simulations demonstrate that the developed ADP is computationally efficient to ensure the driving comfort, safety, and fuel economy of the studied IPHEV when simultaneously planning the vehicle speed and allocating the power within the powertrain. To be specific, the developed strategy can reach 98.01% and 94.22% energy optimality of dynamic programming under urban and mixed driving conditions.</description></item><item><title>An Integrated Self-Modularized Battery Equalizer and Supercapacitor Charger for Hybrid Electric Vehicle Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472064</link><description>This paper proposes a voltage equalizer based on voltage multiplier for the hybrid electric vehicle energy storage system.

Nonetheless, the task remains highly formidable due to the complex road characteristics and the large computational burdens involved. Consequently, the co-optimization technique in off-road scenarios has rarely received scholarly attention. This paper presents an integrated-optimization control framework with active safety module, a cooperative optimization controller, and a path tracking controller for an autonomous HEV. The active safety module deduces the restrictive relationship of both the environment and the vehicle's lateral stability on the power distribution and then determines a reasonable feasible region for cooperative optimization. Besides, the model predictive control (MPC)-based control strategies are designed to achieve satisfying control performance for the co-optimization and the path tracking with the stability constraint conditions. Additionally, a continuation/ generalized minimal residual (C/GMRES) algorithm is developed to mitigate the huge computation burden of the online nonlinear MPC controller, thereby benefiting from real-time control capability. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed control framework and strategy can achieve an efficient power split and path tracking efficacy while greatly reducing the computational burden in the complex off-road scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Coexistence of Energy-Minimizing URLLC and eMBB in Power IoT via NOMA-Based Collaborative MEC Heterogeneous Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10470395</link><description>As the power Internet of Things (PIoT) are widely connected and intelligent, the coexistence of enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) services in power grids is becoming increasingly necessary for precise sensing and control. Specifically, eMBB mainly pursues high data rates, while URLLC requires low-latency and ultra-reliable communications. Since network resources are limited, high throughput eMBB users in a shared environment can adversely affect the ability of URLLC users to achieve low latency and high reliability due to resource contention and interference. Therefore it is particularly difficult to overcome the coexistence challenges in PIoT. In this paper, we propose a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based collaborative mobile edge computing (C-MEC) heterogeneous network model for PIoT (PNCM-HetNets). The main objective is to minimize the total energy consumption while while satisfying URLLC and eMBB offload requests. We develop an alternating optimization-based energy-minimizing resource allocation (AOEMRA) algorithm for PNCM-HetNets, which decomposes the joint optimization problem into subproblems of subchannel allocation, power control and collaborative computing resource allocation. Numerous simulation results show that our algorithm achieves approximated optimal performance with reduced complexity and outperforms benchmark methods in terms of energy savings for users.</description></item><item><title>A Full-Metal Dual-Band Millimeter-Wave Antenna Array With Concomitant Multifold Orthogonal Beamforming for V2V and V2I Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475557</link><description>This article introduces a millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication system with a concomitant multifold orthogonal beamforming (CMOB) antenna array to support vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. Through a single feed, the antenna triggers the TE011 and TE101 modes within the cavity, encompassing dual bands. Concurrently, it integrates slotted elements on various surfaces of the cavity to generate antenna beams distinguished by their orthogonal characteristics. A full-metal cavity provides high power handling capabilities without the need for complex feeding networks. For a 1&#215;4 antenna array, we have employed three different designs: dual orthogonal beams, triple orthogonal beams, and quadruple orthogonal beams. This process is carried out to assess the viability of the designs and to fine-tune the shape of the quadruple orthogonal beams through optimization. Subsequently, a 1&#215;4 antenna array featuring quadruple orthogonal beams is constructed and subjected to measurement. The gains of the array's orthogonal beams are 9.828 dBi and 9.655 dBi, which demonstrates a close correspondence with the simulated outcomes. This serves to affirm the practicality of the design approach.</description></item><item><title>A BAC-NOMA Design for 6G umMTC With Hybrid SIC: Convex Optimization or Learning-Based?</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10477872</link><description>This paper presents a new backscattering communication (BackCom)-assisted non-orthogonal multipleaccess (BAC-NOMA) transmission scheme for device-to-device (D2D) communications. This scheme facilitates energy and spectrum cooperation between BackCom devices and cellular downlink users in 6G ultra-massive machine-type communications (umMTC) scenarios. Given its quasi-uplink nature, the hybrid successive interference cancellation (SIC) is applied to further improve performance. The data rate of BackCom devices with high quality of service (QoS) requirements is maximized by jointly optimizing backscatter coefficients and the beamforming vector. The use of hybrid SIC and BackCom yields two non-concave sub-problems involving transcendental functions. To address this problem, this paper designs and compares convex optimization-based and unsupervised deep learning-based algorithms. In the convex optimization, the closed-form backscatter coefficients of the first sub-problem are obtained, and then semi-definite relaxation (SDR) is utilized to design the beamforming vector. On the other hand, the second sub-problem is approximated by using a combination of sequential convex approximation (SCA) and SDR. For unsupervised deep learning-based optimization, a loss function is properly designed to satisfy constraints. Computer simulations show the following instructive results: i) the superiority of the hybrid SIC strategy; ii) the distinct sensitivities and efficacies of these two algorithms in response to varying parameters; iii) the superior robustness of the unsupervised deep learning-based optimization.</description></item><item><title>A Low Complexity Iterative SC-FDE Receiver for Massive MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478768</link><description>Computing a Gram matrix and a large-dimensional matrix inversion accounts for most of the signal detection complexity in massive MIMO systems. When massive MIMO schemes are combined with Single-Carrier with Frequency-Domain Equalization (SC-FDE), employing powerful iterative equalizers like the Iterative Block Decision-Feedback Equalizer (IB-DFE), the matrix inversion operations need to be computed for each iteration, which further increases the receiver complexity. To avoid the exact matrix inversions in IB-DFE receivers, an alternative structure of IB-DFE is proposed in this work. The proposed IB-DFE receiver allows to incorporate the conventional iterative methods such as Richardson iteration, Gauss-Seidel iteration, etc. to replace the exact matrix inversions in the IB-DFE receiver. In addition, this work proposes Chebyshev accelerated Richardson iteration to improve the convergence rate of the conventional Richardson method and incorporates it with proposed IB-DFE receiver. The simulation results show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce computational complexity compared to the state-of-the-art methodologies while still obtaining a bit error rate (BER) performance similar to that of the conventional receiver.</description></item><item><title>Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient-Based Intelligent Task Offloading for Vehicular Computing With Priority Experience Playback</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478778</link><description>With the development of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology, users' demand for low latency and high-quality network services has increased. However, executing large computing tasks on vehicles with limited resources still faces significant challenges. To address these issues, users can offload computing tasks to nearby base stations or servers. Nevertheless, due to the dynamic and complex nature of the IoV environment, obtaining the optimal task offloading policy in real-time is a great challenge. In this work, first we establish a queuing model for the incoming task flow, then we propose a profit function for task computation and offloading that takes into account the delay, energy consumption, and the user's demand for quality of service (QoS). Considering the dynamic nature and the complexity of the IoV scenarios, we abstract the task offloading as a Markov Decision Process. We choose the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to make the task offloading decision and combine Priority Experience Playback (PER) mechanism to evaluate and select actions so as to output the optimal offloading policy. Experimental results indicate that the offloading decision in our proposed method converges more quickly compared to traditional algorithms.We also discussed the impact of priority experience replay mechanism, learning rate and other factors on reward values. Our proposed method can achieve the minimum latency and energy consumption, effectively adapt to environmental changes, and improve user service experience.</description></item><item><title>Communications Channel Characteristics in the Presence of Aircraft Body Blockage in Urban Air Mobility</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10488677</link><description>In urban air mobility, the blockage of the conductive airframe, including its blades, plays an indispensable role in air-to-air and air-to-ground communications.

However, nonlinear self-interference (SI) introduced by nonideal transceiver components is considered as the main challenge in FD systems. Traditionally, nonlinear SI is characterized by polynomial models, which are computationally expensive. In this letter, a novel neural network (NN) structure, refered to as the convolutional NN with Mish activation function based on knowledge distillation (KD-MCNN), as well as three practical methods for NN design and training are proposed to model nonlinear SI with lower computational complexity. To accommodate hardware with varying computational capabilities, nine KD-MCNN models with different scales are provided. The numerical simulations show that KD-MCNN cancellers exhibit superior performance and computational efficiency compared to both polynomial-based cancellers and existing NN-based cancellers. In particular, the nonlinear SI power can be further reduced by approximately 7.70&#160;dB via the KD-MCNN teacher canceller, which is only 2.48&#160;dB above the receiver's noise floor.</description></item><item><title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Computation Rate Maximization in RIS-Enabled Mobile Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504542</link><description>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology to enhance the performance of mobile edge computing (MEC) network. Nevertheless, the RIS-enabled MEC network design is a non-trivial problem. This paper investigates the RIS-enabled MEC network, where the Internet of Things devices (IoTDs) with limited energy budgets can offload their partial computation tasks to the base station (BS). We first formulate a sum computation rate maximization problem by jointly designing the RIS phase shifts, and the IoTDs' energy partition strategies for local computing and offloading. Then, to handle the non-convex optimization problem, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm, in which the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm is adopted to optimize the RIS phase shifts and the IoTDs' energy partition strategies. Simulation results show that the proposed TD3 solution can reach a better sum computation rate than the benchmark algorithms.</description></item><item><title>PV System Installation Assessment Based on Power Measurement for Balcony Power Plant Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10507888</link><description>Photovoltaic systems for balcony power plant applications are rapidly growing, and with it comes the need for holistic concepts for energy utilization. Since these systems are intended for users without deep technical knowledge, the applications need to work and optimize themselves automatically without the user having to interfere. Therefore, this article presents a method to estimate the azimuth and the inclination of photovoltaic modules by analyzing the on-site power data and comparing it to a power forecast by Forecast. Solar, thereby making it unnecessary for users to provide these values themselves. The information gained hereby can be used to obtain and optimize a power forecast considering prevailing on-site conditions for energy management purposes. This is done by using low-volume power data at hourly resolution, where a single day of data is enough to make an estimation. The results of this method provide PV installation parameters with a resolution of the azimuth in 45$^{\circ }$-steps and the inclination in 15$^{\circ }$-steps, which are matched to the best-fitting power forecast.</description></item><item><title>High-Efficiency TOPCon Solar Cells With Laser-Assisted Localized Boron Doping via Silicon Paste</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10500405</link><description>In the present study, we establish a physical model for laser-assisted localized boron doping in N-type tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) solar cells by employing the fluid dynamics method. Our simulations reveal that a flat-top beam inflicts less thermal damage on silicon than a Gaussian beam at a constant laser energy density. Additionally, we observe an acceleration in the flow rate of molten silicon in the molten pool as the laser energy density increases. This acceleration facilitates efficient doping of boron atoms into the silicon substrate, albeit accompanied by an expansion of the local thermal damage range. In light of these findings, we utilized boron-doped silicon paste as a doping source in experiments conducted on a 15 MW TOPCon solar cells production line employing four distinct laser energy densities. The experiments yielded a reduction in the sheet resistance to 81.9 &#937;/cm in the boron-doped regions, an increase in the peak boron doping concentration to 1.08 &#215; 1019 atoms/cm3, and a doping depth of 2.38 &#956;m. Consequently, the highest efficiency enhancement recorded was 0.14%, culminating in an efficiency of 25.06%. This research outlines the mechanism of the laser-assisted localized boron doping process and provides insights for enhancing the efficiency of TOPCon solar cells.</description></item><item><title>UV Laser Scribing for Perovskite Solar Modules Fabrication, Pros, and Cons</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10528668</link><description>Laser scribing is one of the most challenging steps in fabricating solar modules, which determines their internal resistance, geometrical factor, and efficiency. Pulsed Nd:YVO4 lasers with wavelengths of 355, 532, and 1064 nm are the most common lasers used in the photovoltaic industry. As using one single laser source for all scribing steps is more cost effective, in this article after summarizing recent progress in laser scribing for perovskite modules, a nanosecond UV-laser (355 nm) is used for all scribing steps needed for series interconnections in structures with glass or plastic substrates and studied how different scribing parameters, such as repetition frequency, output average power density, and scan speed, must be selected to adjust the transferred power density to the layer, enabling efficient scribing without overheating and cracking the layers. In addition to producing sharp strips on glass/ transparent conducting layer (TCO) substrates, especially thick fluorine-doped tin oxide, nanosecond UV laser provides a wide window for patterning the perovskite layer without damaging glass/TCO. However, in the case of plastic substrates, melted materials deform the edges of the strips&#8217; profiles. These results, along with reviewed results from the literature, provide a good insight into optimized laser scribing for perovskite solar module fabrication.</description></item><item><title>Metamorphic and Lattice-Matched GaInP Rear-Heterojunction Solar Cells for Improved Performance at Elevated Temperatures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10502388</link><description>We present the characteristics of n-on-p front-junction (FJ) and rear-heterojunction (RHJ) GaInP solar cells at operating temperatures (T) up to 300 &#176;C. Photovoltaic cells with efficient operation at high T may be important for satellite missions near the sun or as laser power converters for sensors operating in harsh environments. In this article, we show that the time-resolved photoluminescence lifetime (${{\tau }_{\text{TRPL}}}$) values in both lattice-matched (LM) n-Ga0.51In0.49P and metamorphic (MM) n-Ga0.37In0.63P double heterostructures are high and increase significantly with T. In contrast, the ${{\tau }_{\text{TRPL}}}$ values in their p-type counterparts are lower and decrease with T. We go on to demonstrate both LM and MM solar cells in FJ and RHJ configurations. The internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of MM RHJ cells increases significantly up to T = 300 &#176;C due to the increase in both ${{\tau }_{\text{TRPL}}}$ and the linear increase in diffusivity with T. In contrast, the IQE for MM FJ cells is nearly unchanged as T increases, while the IQE of LM cells drops sharply across all wavelengths. RHJ cells maintain higher open-circuit voltage and fill factor than their FJ counterparts, leading to a significant efficiency advantage at T = 100&#8211;300 &#176;C. Taken together, our work shows that MM cells perform well at elevated T and that RHJ cells are promising for high-T operation.</description></item><item><title>A Hysteresis Compensation Algorithm for the Generation of Nonlinear Voltage Sweep for IV-Characteristic Measurement of High-Capacitance Solar Modules With Xenon Flasher</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10540034</link><description>Short measurement time of tens of ms at industrial production leads to high influence of parasitic current on the current voltage (IV) curve characterization. This parasitic current deteriorates the measurement accuracy and should be mitigated. However, most methods, like, e.g., sectional measurement or DragonBackTM, are based on either unpractical long measurement time or sophisticated simulations. We present an algorithm for the generation of voltage sweep for low hysteresis measurement of IV characteristics in high capacitive solar modules. Using one linear voltage sweep-based IV characteristics as input, an optimized nonlinear voltage sweep is generated with our algorithm. While the linear voltage ramp during a 93 ms pulse leads to a hysteresis error at maximum power (&#1013;Pmpp) of 1.46% for a 1-cell heterojunction minimodule and 2.35% for a 120-cells heterojunction solar module, the &#1013;Pmpp with the optimized nonlinear voltage ramp is reduced to 0.38% and 0.48%, respectively. The hysteresis error of short-circuit current (&#1013;Isc) and hysteresis error of open-circuit voltage (&#1013;Voc) remain below 0.5% by optimized nonlinear voltage ramp. Thus, all three hysteresis error parameters &#1013;Pmpp, &#1013;Isc, and &#1013;Voc fulfill the standard IEC 60904-1 (edition-3).</description></item><item><title>Measurement of Photovoltaic Module Deformation Dynamics During Hail Impact Using Digital Image Correlation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10551381</link><description>Stereo high-speed video of photovoltaic modules undergoing laboratory hail tests was processed using digital image correlation to determine module surface deformation during and immediately following impact. The purpose of this work was to demonstrate a methodology for characterizing module impact response differences as a function of construction and incident hail parameters. Video capture and digital image analysis were able to capture out-of-plane module deformation to a resolution of &#177;0.1 mm at 11 kHz on an in-plane grid of 10 &#215; 10 mm over the area of a 1 &#215; 2 m commercial photovoltaic module. With lighting and optical adjustments, the technique was adaptable to arbitrary module designs, including size, backsheet color, and cell interconnection. Impacts were observed to produce an initially localized dimple in the glass surface, with peak deflection proportional to the square root of incident energy. Subsequent deformation propagation and dissipation were also captured, along with behavior for instances when the module glass fractured. Natural frequencies of the module were identifiable by analyzing module oscillations postimpact. Limitations of the measurement technique were that the impacting ice ball obscured the data field immediately surrounding the point of contact, and both ice and glass fracture events occurred within 100 &#956;s, which was not resolvable at the chosen frame rate. Increasing the frame rate and visualizing the back surface of the impact could be applied to avoid these issues. Applications for these data include validating computational models for hail impacts, identifying the natural frequencies of a module, and identifying damage initiation mechanisms.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Power Prediction for Bifacial PV Systems in Varied Shading Conditions: A Circuit-LSTM Approach Within a Digital Twin Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10529620</link><description>The prediction of bifacial photovoltaic (bPV) system performance under variable conditions has persistently challenged researchers and practitioners alike, largely due to the unstable and imprecise irradiance measurements and the extensive training processes required for machine learning-based methods. Addressing these issues, this study introduces an innovative digital twin system that integrates a novel circuit-long short-term memory (LSTM) model with the newly proposed triangle-shading pattern estimation method, eliminating dependencies on direct irradiance measurements and historical data. Our approach uniquely combines the adaptability of LSTM networks with circuit models, facilitating real-time power prediction with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. Comprehensive evaluations across various shading scenarios demonstrate the proposed model's superior performance, consistently reducing mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean squared error by over 50% compared with existing methods.

However, maintaining PV system efficiency remains a challenging problem. In desert regions, soiling is one of the most significant environmental factors that can cause PV system loss. In our early work, a PV soiling loss estimation method based on a single-image feature and in-lab testing was developed. In this study, we extend our previous work by incorporating various image features in a machine-learning regression model to predict PV soiling loss. The new model is trained and tested using PV performance data and RAW panel images collected in the field over several months, covering real-time soiling loss levels up to about 28%. There are 479 RAW images with 21 unique soiling loss levels, which were taken under different camera settings. The results show that the new method can reliably predict the soiling loss when the images are taken under similar settings as the training data (R-squared value of 0.98 and normalized RMSE is 0.01 for the training dataset).</description></item><item><title>Effects of Local Economy and Seasonal Cleaning Cycle on Yield and Profit of Soiled Solar Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10550921</link><description>Alongside advancements in photovoltaics (PV) technology, efficient solar farm operation (e.g., strategic panel cleaning) can help lower electricity generation costs in the field. In this work, we study the effects of season-dependent soiling and cleaning on energy yield, revenue, and profit in four locations &#8211; Dhaka (Bangladesh), Oregon City (USA), Berlin (Germany), and Rumah (Saudi Arabia). These locations cover a wide range of soiling rates, season-dependent rainfall, cleaning costs, and tariff rates for a broad techno-economic analysis of soiling-affected solar farms. While a two-month cleaning cycle, for example, apparently seems too long for soiling-prone locations (Dhaka and Rumah) &#8211; this is too frequent for Oregon City and Berlin due to their high cleaning costs. Therefore, the optimal strategy for maximum profit for the latter two locations is to never clean the panels. Even at optimal cleaning cycle (maximum revenue/profit), there is a profit-loss of 13.28%, 19.97%, 1.39%, and 42.88%, compared with the respective soiling-free rated farm output at these locations. We also show the sensitivity of output and profit to the variations in soiling rate and cleaning cost; farms in Dhaka and Rumah show strong sensitivity due to the high soiling rate and low cleaning costs.</description></item><item><title>Multidimensional Evaluation Method for the Operational Status of Photovoltaic Arrays in Large-Scale PV Power Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10506328</link><description>As the core and critical component of photovoltaic (PV) power stations, accurately evaluating the operational status of PV arrays is key to enabling intelligent operation of the power station. In the actual power station, only current and voltage data of the PV array are available, but the outputs of PV arrays exhibit noticeable random fluctuations, making it challenging to comprehensively evaluate the PV arrays in terms of power generation, data quality, and stability. To solve the above problems, this article proposed evaluation indicators for the operational status of arrays from multiple dimensions, including data quality, normalized generated power, performance ratio, dynamic performance, and stability of the arrays. The indicators were calculated individually, and then a comprehensive evaluation and recognition of the arrays&#8217; operational status were achieved through the utilization of weight calculation and quantile method. The article presented a systematic approach for evaluating the operational status of PV arrays using multidimensional evaluation indicators and the comprehensive evaluation method innovatively. The proposed multidimensional indicators provide a comprehensive evaluation of the PV arrays' operational status, without requiring any additional hardware investment. This study aims to provide a theoretical and practical foundation to effectively monitor the operational status of PV arrays. Compared with the traditional fuzzy C-means method, the method can give quantitative evaluation results of the operational status for PV arrays.</description></item><item><title>Implementation of Multiple-Step Quantized STDP Based on Novel Memristive Synapses</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10520271</link><description>Memristors have been widely studied as artificial synapses in neuromorphic circuits, due to their functional similarity with biological synapses, low operating power, and high integration density. Currently, the synaptic weight symbolic limitation and weight update inaccuracy are two challenging issues to be solved. In this work, a novel memristive synapse and a matched mixed-signal neuron circuit are designed to implement robust yet accurate spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning in excitatory and inhibitory synapses. To break through the weight symbolic limitation, a four memristors and two resistors (4M2R) synapse composed of 4M2R for spiking neural network (SNN) is designed. The proposed synapse can be either excitatory or inhibitory (E/I) by rationally arranging the resistors in the circuit, and it is the first of its kind, enabling Hebbian and anti-Hebbian training without additional adjusting of neural signals. In addition, the high symmetricity, linearity, and stability against device variation of the 4M2R synapse can also greatly improve the weight update accuracy. To further address the inaccurate weight update issue caused by signal complexity, a neuron circuit is designed to generate square-wave pulses for spike transmission and synaptic weight modulation. Simulations are carried out in the MATLAB Simscape as well as Virtuoso using SMIC  $0.18~\mu $ m process and a specially developed memristor model for SNN synapse simulation. The simulating results show good agreement with the weight change derived from the algorithmic methods, and the influence of weak signal-induced weight variation on circuit performance can be rigorously assessed.</description></item><item><title>Multibit Content Addressable Memory Design and Optimization Based on 3-D nand-Compatible IGZO Flash</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521670</link><description>Content addressable memory (CAM) has been employed in various data-intensive tasks for its parallel pattern-matching capability. To enhance the density and efficiency of CAMs, emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM) technologies have been exploited in the CAM designs. Recently, the multilevel cell (MLC) characteristics of NVMs have been utilized in several analog and multibit CAM designs, achieving higher density than conventional binary/ternary CAM designs. However, these analog and multibit CAM designs are built with the practical experience of circuit designers, lacking a general analog/multibit design methodology. In this article, we propose a general and effective design and optimization scheme for multibit CAM, using a novel 3-D nand-compatible amorphous indium-gallium&#8211;zinc-oxide (IGZO) flash as a proxy of three-terminal NVM devices. The proposed scheme encodes the multibit data into the flash devices, enabling the 3-D nand flash array to operate as an ultradense nand or nor CAM without significant structural change. For further performance optimization, we propose a design space exploration scheme for optimal CAM parameters. Evaluation results suggest that the CAM design based on our proposed design and optimization scheme achieves over  $35\times $  area per bit saving compared with the representative ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET)-based multibit CAM, and a  $38.1\times $  energy-delay-area product (EDAP) improvement over the state-of-the-art analog CAM, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Channel Package-Scale Galvanic Isolation Interface for Wide Bandgap Gate Drivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10495721</link><description>This article presents the design of a three-channel package-scale galvanic isolation interface for SiC and GaN power switching converters. The isolation interface consists of two side-by-side co- packaged chips fabricated in a low-cost 0.32- $\mu \text{m}$  bipolar CMOS&#8211;DMOS (BCD) technology and includes three isolation data channels based on RF-coupled integrated microantennas. The isolation interface provides a channel for the gate driver control, a bidirectional channel for diagnostic, and a channel for the isolated power supply control. They use on&#8211;off keying (OOK)-modulated RF carriers of 1.5, 0.5, and 1.5 GHz, respectively. The galvanic isolation interface provides a maximum signal rate of 2 and 1.9 MHz for the driver and the power control channels, respectively, whereas the diagnostic channel guarantees half-duplex bidirectional communication up to 15 MHz. Thanks to the package-scale isolation approach, both reinforced galvanic isolation and first-rate common-mode transient immunity (CMTI) are achieved. High immunity to adjacent channel crosstalk is guaranteed by using channel frequency/physical separation. To best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, this is the first implementation of a package-scale galvanic isolation interface with three independent communication channels, including a bidirectional channel, in silicon technology.</description></item><item><title>A Power-On-Reset Circuit With Accurate Trigger-Point Voltage and Ultralow Typical Quiescent Current for Emerging Nonvolatile Memory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10494042</link><description>In this article, a power-on-reset (POR) circuit with accurate trigger-point voltage and ultralow typical quiescent current for emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM) is presented. To keep the trigger-point voltage from the effect of process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) and supply ramp rate variations, low-cost current generators and a current comparator are adopted with brown-out detection (BOD). A protection circuit is utilized for correct operations in different BOD events. Meanwhile, delay blocks are utilized to generate reliable pulse signals that are less influenced by temperature and supply ramp rate. The simulation results show that the trigger-point voltage is 2.08 V with a temperature coefficient (TC) of 81.8 ppm/&#176;C and a deviation to the ramp time of 9.91% for a wide ramp time range from  $10 ~\mu \text{s}$  to dc. In addition, the reset duration time of the POR pulse is also reliable. The proposed POR circuit designed in the 55-nm CMOS process consumes only 0.65-nA typical quiescent current and  $59\times 146\,\,\mu \text{m}$  area, which is suitable for emerging NVM systems.</description></item><item><title>Low Complexity Design of Logistic Distance Metric Adaptive Filter for Impulsive Noise Environments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555050</link><description>In many practical scenarios, non-Gaussian noise contaminates the desired signal and introduces outliers. The recently proposed logistic distance metric adaptive filter (LDMAF) outperforms the existing algorithms and provides better performance in the presence of such outliers. There is a need for efficient hardware architecture for the implementation of LDMAF. This article proposes an efficient VLSI architecture of LDMAF. The implementation of error-gradient function of LDMAF puts significant implementation problem in terms of delay and cost.

This mixed-computation approach uses 4-bit Posit (Posit4), which has higher precision around 0, for representing weights with high sensitivity, while it uses 4-bit FixP (FixP4) for representing other weights. A heuristic for analyzing the importance and the quantization error of the weights is presented to assign the proper number system to different weights. In addition, a gradient approximation for Posit representation is introduced to improve the quality of weight updates in the backpropagation process. Due to the high energy consumption of the fully Posit-based computations, neural network operations are carried out in FixP or Posit/FixP. An efficient hardware implementation of an MAC operation with a first Posit operand and FixP for a second operand and accumulator is presented. The efficacy of the proposed low-precision mixed-computation approach is extensively assessed on vision and language models. The results show that on average, the accuracy of the mixed-computation is about 1.5% higher than that of FixP with a cost of 0.19% energy overhead.</description></item><item><title>iEDCL: Streamlined, False-Error-Free Error Detection and Correction Scheme in a Near-Threshold Enabled 32-bit Processor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559764</link><description>This article presents internal error detection, correction, and latching (iEDCL), a designer-friendly, fully functional error detection and correction (EDAC) approach tailored for energy-efficient near-threshold systems capable of tolerating variations. It embeds error detection (ED), correction, and latching circuits within a flip-flop (FF) with an additional 15 transistors to monitor critical paths. Notably, iEDCL&#8217;s error-aware capability remains stable despite clock latency and parasitic effects, relieving designers of extensive involvement and eliminating false errors. iEDCL is automatedly implemented in an ARM Cortex-M0 processor at 55 nm without extra architecture modifications, incurring only a 6.78% area overhead. An adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) loop enables automatic operation, achieving high energy efficiency beyond the point of the first failure while maintaining a predefined error rate. Measurement results obtained from different dies at various temperatures demonstrate significant energy savings achieved by the iEDCL processor, with up to 16.9% and 49.1% reductions compared to critical baseline and signoff designs, respectively, while maintaining a 5% error rate at a 16 MHz frequency. To the best of our knowledge, this article presents one of the first FF EDAC implementations fully operational without potential false errors at near-threshold voltages while enhancing energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>HRM: M-Term Heterogeneous Hybrid Blend Recursive Multiplier for GF(2n) Polynomial</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10518006</link><description>Hardware-efficient polynomial multipliers are desired to satisfy the ever-growing demands of computing within the finite field space toward developing a strong cryptosystems. This research meticulously explores polynomial multiplication from the context of algebraic structures by introducing a novel hetero-blend recursive multiplier that harnesses the strengths of the contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) designs. The heterogeneous-blend recursive multiplier (HRM) adeptly merges the footprint efficiency of the Karatsuba multiplier (KM) and the compute-latency benefits of the overlap-free KM (OKM) at higher stages, while at lower bounds, it capitalizes the optimal balance of footprint and compute-latency benefits of the schoolbook multiplier (SBM). To further enhance the performance, HRM integrates the heterogeneous term division throughout its stages which is a characteristic find taken from the prior work on M-term nonhomogeneous Karatsuba multiplier (MNHKA). Furthermore, a MATLAB framework has been devised to expedite the exploration process in the finite field design space resulting from the heterogeneous usage of the M terms across multiple stages. The presented HRM design undergoes comprehensive evaluation when benchmarked against contemporary SOTA designs including KM, OKM, their corresponding homogeneous M term variants referred to as M-term Karatsuba multiplier (MKM), M-term OKM (MOKM) alongside recent variants of composite M-term Karatsuba multipliers (CMKA), MNHKA, and equivalent overlap-free variant M-term nonhomogeneous overlap-free Karatsuba multiplier (MNHOKA). The field-programmable gate array (FPGA) synthesized results for the HRM designs on Zynq ZCU-104 board showcase a best-case of 17.288% lookup table (LUT) savings, 5.68% reduction in delay, and 20.88% gain in area-delay product (ADP) compared with the optimal SOTA design, while also revealing a 13.49% reduction in LUT usage, 5.45% decrease in delay, and 12.97% improvement in ADP when compared with the best among MNHKA and MNHOKA designs. Furthermore HRM designs synthesized on the Cadence GPDK45 library achieved a best-case footprint saving of 16.18%, a critical path delay improvement of 29.53%, a remarkable 45.66% gain in the ADP, a substantial 30.37% reduction in power consumption, and a noteworthy 38.63% improvement in power per area when compared with the optimal SOTA design. In comparison to the leading MNHKA and MNHOKA designs, the HRM designs exhibit a best-case footprint improvement of 5.77%, 8.31% reduction in delay, 16.76% enhancement in ADP, a significant 20.18% power savings, and a notable 17.71% improvement in power-per-unit-area (PPA).

This article proposes a 112-channel system-on-chip (SoC) design for neural signal acquisition and processing, comprising full-channel read-out circuits, neural signal-processing accelerators, and a 32-bit RISC-V core. A clock-domain-crossing (CDC) structure is devised to minimize data storage overhead in read-out circuits, facilitating comprehensive data acquisition and high-throughput simultaneous transmission from all channels. The channel-specific processing unit incorporates hardware-efficient designs for lossless compression, spike detection, and extraction of spike features.

With the recent advances of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology, in particular, the necessity to endow interconnected devices with security facilities has increased as well. In this context, the efficient implementation of ROs on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) is crucial, even though it hides some pitfalls. This article presents a new design strategy for multistage ROs relying on the carry chains (CCs) available into modern FPGA devices. Several configurations of ROs designed as proposed here have been characterized in terms of hardware costs, jitter, and temperature/voltage sensitivity. In all the evaluated cases, the proposed design allows to achieve predictable routing schemes through the automatic place and route (P&amp;amp;R), while reducing slice occupancy and energy consumption by up to 50% and 44%, respectively, in comparison with the traditional lookup table (LUT)-based ROs. When realized on a Artix-7 device, the basic version of the proposed oscillator realized using 33 inverting stages allows obtaining multiphase outputs oscillating at 29.7 MHz with a standard deviation less than 10 kHz. The analysis conducted also demonstrates the high flexibility of the novel circuits, such as the possibility to easily change their behavior depending on the target application requirements. As an example, by exploiting additional pass-through elements, the proposed scheme achieves a sensitivity of 49 kHz/&#176;C that is more than 4 times higher than that shown by the corresponding traditional LUT-based competitor, thus making it more suitable for thermal monitoring applications.</description></item><item><title>A Design Framework for Generating Energy-Efficient Accelerator on FPGA Toward Low-Level Vision</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559268</link><description>Low-level vision algorithms play an increasingly crucial role in a wide range of applications, such as biomedical, security, and autopilot. The low-level vision accelerators have also been extensively researched. As low-level vision is often deployed in embedded devices, its accelerators need to achieve high energy efficiency. Meanwhile, the broad application scenarios of low-level vision contribute to its rapid iteration. Designing energy-efficient accelerators for quickly evolving low-level vision algorithms demands substantial effort. Therefore, a design framework specifically tailored for the generation of low-level vision accelerators is urgently needed. In this article, we propose an end-to-end algorithm-hardware generation framework, EffiVision, on field-programmable gate array (FPGA), aimed at generating highly energy-efficient dedicated accelerators for low-level vision neural networks. EffiVision proposes a hardware template that features multiple parallelisms and large architecture exploration spaces specifically designed to accommodate the characteristics of low-level vision networks. Then, it employs activation-weight aware mixed-precision quantization and FPGA-aware NNLUTs to search the suitable hardware parameters within the hardware template, generating highly energy-efficient accelerators tailored for low-level vision networks. We used EffiVision to perform hardware generation for three low-level vision neural networks fast super-resolution convolutional neural network (FSRCNN), denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNN), and demosaicing convolutional neural network (DMCNN) on Xilinx FPGA development boards, achieving the best energy efficiencies of 174.9, 97.8, and 92.7 GOPS/W, respectively. The generated accelerators of FSRCNN and DnCNN are  $1.11\times $  and  $3.37\times $  more efficient than previous works.</description></item><item><title>A 40-Gb/s PAM-3 Receiver With Modified Summer-Merged Slicers and PRTS Checker</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10517958</link><description>This article presents a 40-Gb/s (25.6 GBaud) quarter-rate receiver utilizing three-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM).

Particularly, a coupled technique with bandpass (CTB) characteristic between the kth output node and the ( $k+1$ )th input node of amplification units (AUs) is adopted in the DPA design. It generates an additional signal reuse path (SRP) to reuse part of the output signal to superimpose the input signal, and then they will be reamplified to the output artificial transmission line (O-ATML). Moreover, due to the bandpass characteristic, the signal reuse can be manipulated to target the upper cutting edges of the working band to alleviate sharp gain and power roll-off. By carefully controlling the SRP, the overall gain, output power, and bandwidth are enhanced and extended. The systematic design approach for the DPA is detailed with circuit implementations and optimizations. To validate the proposed concept, a DPA MMIC prototype is implemented and fabricated in a commercial 0.25- $\mu $ m gallium nitride (GaN)-on-silicon carbide (SiC) high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) process. It shows the compact layout within a die size of 3.36 mm2. Under 28-V VDD power supply, the measured results show a flat  $14.8\pm 1.0$ -dB small-signal gain with 10.0-GHz wide operating bandwidth and good impedance matching conditions. A saturated output power ( ${P} _{\text {sat}}$ ) of 7.25 W with peak power-added efficiency (PAE) exceeding 38.7% is achieved. The proposed DPA obtains around 1.54&#8211;2.16-W/mm2 power density associated with an average PAE of 34.5% over the entire frequency range.</description></item><item><title>ALT-Lock: Logic and Timing Ambiguity-Based IP Obfuscation Against Reverse Engineering</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559389</link><description>We present a logic ambiguity-based intellectual property (IP) obfuscation method that replaces traditional key gates with key-controlled functionally ambiguous logic gates, called LGA gates. We also protect timing paths by developing timing-ambiguous sequential cells called TA cells. We call this locking scheme ambiguous logic and timing logic locking (referred to as ALT-Lock). ALT-Lock ensures a two-pronged system-level security scheme where the attacker is forced to unlock not only combinational logic obfuscation but also timing obfuscation. We show that a combination of logic and timing ambiguity (TA) provides security against oracle-guided attacks. This method is superior to other traditional IP protection schemes such as combinational or sequential locking as it guarantees security against both oracle-guided and oracle-free attacks, while ensuring low power, performance, and area (PPA) overhead.</description></item><item><title>Symmetric and Multiphase-Interleaved Ladder Bucks for DC Capacitors Elimination</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10510403</link><description>To improve power density, a symmetric switched-capacitor (SC) ladder buck (SLB) is proposed in this brief that eliminates the fixed ladder in an SC ladder buck (SCLB) by tying the dc nodes in two 180&#176;-phase-shifted cells together. Unlike flying capacitor multilevel converters (FCMCs) that minimize the inductor current ripple, the ladder topology within an SCLB splits the inductor current optimally among the ladder switches, such that the overall equivalent output resistance is minimized. M-phase interleaving is proposed in this brief to allow SLB to regain this current splitting capability when operating via duty cycles larger than 0.5. Simulation results of a six-level four-phase design in 180-nm CMOS verify the performance advantages of the proposed topology.</description></item><item><title>An Unconditional Evenly Spaced STRO With a New Mitigated Drafting Effect Muller C-Element</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10520312</link><description>Muller C-element (MCE) can be utilized in synchronous circuits by forming an oscillator so-called self-timed ring oscillators (STROs). STROs can oscillate in evenly spaced and burst modes, among which the former is desirable for synchronous design. This work introduces a new current mode logic (CML) MCE with an emphasis on evenly spaced oscillation mode in STROs. The proposed MCE is evaluated theoretically in terms of speed with load capacitances of  $C_{L}=25$  and 100 fF.

Moreover, the speed, power, area, and Charlie and drafting effects of the proposed design are compared with those of other CML MCEs. The results show a better drafting effect (about 68% improvement) for the proposed design, leading to the evenly spaced oscillation mode in STROs. All simulations are implemented in 180-nm CMOS technology.</description></item><item><title>A D-Band OOK Transmitter With 50-GHz Bandwidth Achieving 32-Gbps Data Rate in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10414476</link><description>A broadband high-data-rate  ${D}$ -band OOK transmitter (TX) is designed in this article for high-speed communication. The TX consists of an adjustable signal source, a broadband high-speed OOK modulator, and a wideband low-noise power amplifier (LNPA). The proposed LNPA can be utilized simultaneously in both the TX and the receiver to improve the RF bandwidth of the system, thus increasing the data transmission rate. Additionally, a dual-mode balun was utilized, which is compatible with single-ended and differential interfaces. The TX was fabricated in a 28-nm bulk CMOS process and achieved more than 5-dBm output power under 1-V supply voltage with 167-mW dc power consumption. For testing purposes, the TX is connected to a receiver via wire bonding, achieving a data rate of 32 Gbps in the OOK modulation scheme. Moreover, a wideband antenna was designed and implemented on printed circuit board (PCB) for the over-the-air (OTA) transmission, supporting data rates of 20 Gbps at a distance of 6 cm. To the best of our knowledge, this work demonstrates the widest RF bandwidth and the highest data rate in TXs without predistortion and equalization, which can provide excellent performance for  ${D}$ -band high-speed communication.</description></item><item><title>A Phase-Modulation Phase-Shifting Phased-Array Transmitter With Phase Self-Calibration and Deep PBOs Efficiency Enhancement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416729</link><description>In this article, a digital phase-modulation (PM) phase-shifting (PS) phased-array transmitter is proposed. Both PM and PS are implemented in a PS modulator. Meanwhile, a self-calibration loop is introduced in the PS modulator for improved phase linearity and minimized phase error. The phase control voltages for the PS modulator are generated from the self-calibration loop based on the output signals and reference signals. To reduce the calibration time, a capacitor-array-based state store memory is introduced in the self-calibration loop. Efficiency at 2.5-/6-/12-dB power back-off (PBO) is enhanced by class-G Doherty switched-capacitor power amplifier (SCPA). As a verification of the concept, a 2.1&#8211;2.9-GHz four-element phased-array transmitter is designed and fabricated in a conventional 40-nm CMOS technology. The transmitter features a 10-bit fast-locking phase self-calibration with measured 0.4&#176; rms phase error and 0.2-dB rms power error. The measured peak saturated output power of each element is 26.95 dBm at 2.4 GHz. Besides, the measured system efficiency at 0-/2.5-/6-/12-dB PBO is 37.25%/34.24%/30.12%/21.23%.

The proposed QHC receiver front end employs analog correlation, two-step synchronization with a digital-assisted path, and time-interleaved (TI) sampling methods for low-power synchronization and demodulation.

Such a TRX array can support fast auto-beam-steering in both receiver (RX) and transmitter (TX) arrays. The link-tracking loop is introduced to generate the phase and amplitude control codes of the RX array, which can automatically steer the RX beam to the unknown target direction to establish the RX link. After the RX link is located, the link-tracking loop provides a phase control code to steer the TX beam toward the target. Meanwhile, the time division modulator consists of four digital power amplifiers (DPAs), a quadrature signal generator, and a sign-map circuit. The time division modulator can not only tune the LO power for RX gain flatness improvement but also provide a baseband-to-RF direct conversion in TX mode. The measured link-tracking time and peak TX system efficiency are  $7~\mu \text{s}$  and 25.3%, respectively, while the proposed TRX array can support 4.8 Gb/s 64-QAM and 8 Gb/s 16-QAM transmission.</description></item><item><title>A Fractional-N Sampling PLL With a Merged Constant-Slope DTC and Sampling PD</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10438423</link><description>This article presents a 3.3&#8211;4.5-GHz fractional- $N$  analog sampling phase-locked loop (SPLL). A merged constant-slope digital-to-time converter and sampling phase detector (CSDTC-SPD) allows phase error detection as well as quantization noise (QN) cancellation in a single ramp generation, which reduces the source of noise and nonlinearity. A modified multimodulus divider (MMDIV) with two phase retimers reduces the required CSDTC-SPD linear range and decreases the noise from the CSDTC-SPD. To verify the principle, a prototype SPLL was implemented and fabricated in a conventional 40-nm CMOS technology.

Zero-voltage switching (ZVS) turn-on control for each active diode is developed to minimize converter power loss when rectifying 40.68-MHz input ac voltage. Synchronous PFM control is also proposed to regulate both outputs and provides fast load transient responses.

The output cross-regulation is unnoticeable under load step changes. Compared with the prior art, the proposed dual-output regulating rectifier is the first to support ac input with the highest resonance frequency of 40.68 MHz that results in the reduction of the receiver (RX) coil size by at least four times.</description></item><item><title>A 64-Channel Inverter-Based Neural Signal Recording Amplifier With a Novel Differential-Like OTA Achieving an NEF of 0.84</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10445022</link><description>This article presents an inverter-based multichannel low-power low-noise neural signal recording amplifier with a novel differential-like operational transconductance amplifier (OTA). The differential-like OTA consists of two asymmetric branches. The inverting branch used for multichannel inputs has more inverters in parallel than that of the noninverting branch used for reference. Two virtual rails with very low impedance are designed in the differential-like OTA to effectively reduce the noise-efficiency-factor (NEF) and crosstalk in input channels. The NEF and the effective average current per channel decreases as the number of channels increases. Furthermore, by optimizing the current ratio of the inverting and the noninverting branches of the OTA, the NEF of the proposed amplifier is minimized and approaches the NEF of an ideal inverter of  $\sqrt {2}/2$  as the channel counts increase to infinity. The area per channel is reduced even more significantly as the channel counts increase. The proposed amplifier architecture with 4-channel, 16-channel, and 64-channel configurations were fabricated and measured. The results show that the noise, power, and area performance were all improved by integrating more channels in parallel. For the 64-channel amplifier, the measured NEF is 0.84, the effective average current per channel is 422 nA and the area per channel is only 0.044 mm2.</description></item><item><title>An Enhanced Class-F Dual-Core VCO With Common-Mode-Noise Self-Cancellation and Isolation Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10453607</link><description>In this article, an enhanced class-F voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with common-mode-noise self-cancellation (CM-NC) and common-mode-noise isolation (CM-NI) technique is proposed. With the proposed CM-NC technique, the common-mode-noise current of the drain coil and that of the nearby source coil are in the opposite direction. Therefore, the magnetic fields generated by the two coils cancel each other, which reduces the noise injected into the VCO from power supply and the ground node. Moreover, the principle of decoupling between the two inductors is also employed to eliminate the influence of the common-mode tail inductor on the differential mode. By winding the gate coil into a double-turn structure, the coupling noise from the drain inductor to the gate is opposite to the induced current of the gate coil, thereby cutting off the noise coupling path from the drain to the gate. Thanks to the dual-core 8-shaped inductor structure, the phase noise (PN) is improved without increasing the area, compared with existing methods using separated and dedicated tail filtering inductors. The VCO is fabricated in a 65-nm complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The measured tuning range is 21.7% from 11.5 to 14.3 GHz. The PN and figure of merit (FoM) at 1-MHz offset are &#8722;119.2 and 192.8 dBc/Hz, respectively. The power consumption across the frequency tuning range is 5.6&#8211;10 mW.

An asynchronously tuned coupled resonator (ATCR) circuit model is introduced to effectively design PA&#8217;s non-ideal transformer-based broadband output matching network (OMN). Two adaptive feedback linearizers (AFLs) and multi-gated transistor (MGTR) techniques are adapted to optimize the linearity. Both amplitude-to-amplitude (AM&#8722;AM) and amplitude-to-phase modulation (AM&#8722;PM) distortion are improved over one octave with these techniques. A prototype PA is implemented in 28-nm bulk CMOS to verify the proposed ideas. The measured PA realizes 76%  $S_{21}\,\,-$ 3-dB fraction bandwidth (FBW) from 19.7 to 43.8 GHz, fully supporting five operating bands in 5G new radio (NR) frequency range 2 (FR2), i.e.,  $n$ 257&#8211; $n$ 261. The measured  $\vert $ AM&#8722;PM $\vert $  is less than 4&#176; over 24&#8722;43 GHz. The large-signal measurement results show that the PA realizes 18.7&#8722;20.3-dBm  $P_{\mathrm {sat}}$ , 16.8&#8722;19-dBm OP1dB, 24.9%&#8722;35.5% PAEmax, and 20.6%&#8211;29.7% PAEP1dB over 22&#8722;40 GHz.

The proposed SNR-enhanced 8-ary (SNRE-8) scheme modulates pulse width, position, and amplitude to improve the SNR. The proposed SNRE-8 modulation leverages the wireline channel loss to perform the modulation. Digital decoding of mutually exclusive eyes generated by the proposed SNRE-8 modulation further improves the eye margin at the receiver. A 27-Gb/s transceiver is implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process employing the proposed modulation. A PAM-8 transmitter is implemented on the same chip for comparison purposes. Compared to the PAM-8 modulation, the proposed SNRE-8 modulation shows an average SNR improvement of 10.6 dB at the near-end eye at the cost of 6.6% eye width reduction. With the aid of a time-domain feed-forward equalizer (FFE) and a continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE), the proposed SNRE-8 transceiver achieves a bit error rate (BER) of  $10^{-8}$  on a 9-dB loss channel with an energy efficiency of 5.39 pJ/bit.</description></item><item><title>A 26-Gb/s Framed-Pulsewidth Modulation Transceiver for Extended Reach Optical Links</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10477935</link><description>This article proposes a high-speed framed-pulsewidth modulation (FPWM) transceiver that applies a time-domain modulation scheme for increased spectrum efficiency. The achieved coding gain is 75%, indicating that the minimum pulsewidth is increased by 1.75 times compared to an NRZ scheme with an identical data rate. Such bandwidth reduction renders dispersion tolerance both in copper and optical channels. The encoder and decoder employ successive approximation (SA) and weighted sum (WS) algorithms for power-and-area efficiency. The FPWM demonstrates an 8-dB SNR gain over NRZ at 15-km single-mode fiber (SMF) transmission while maintaining identical back-to-back performance. The FPWM scheme shows 6-dB higher receiver sensitivity at a bit error rate (BER) of 2e-5 than the PAM-4 signaling in 26-Gb/s back-to-back transmission and achieves 4-dB SNR gain at 20-km transmission.

The driver of the transmitter (TX) configured with two different types of current mode PAM-4 drivers generates CMDM-8, a mixed signal of single NRZ and differential PAM-4. If the common-mode voltage (VCM) of the two types of PAM-4 drivers is different, the VCM of the CMDM-8 signals swings between the two different VCM even if the two PAM-4 drivers generate the identical PAM-4 signal in the DM. Therefore, the TX can generate the NRZ signal in the CM while transmitting the PAM-4 signals. At the receiver (RX), the CMDM-8, which combines NRZ and PAM-4 signals, is divided into NRZ and PAM-4 signals in the analog front end. The divided analog signals are converted to the 3-bit digital data in the decoder. The 3-bit decoder recovers the NRZ and PAM-4 signals to the original data. When 2 bits are recovered from the PAM-4 signal, the VCM of the PAM-4 signal is not constant due to the residual NRZ signal. Thus, the proposed PAM-4 decoder applies an offset-based PAM-4 decoding method to achieve robustness against the VCM change. The prototype was fabricated with a 28-nm CMOS technology and had a maximum data rate of 48 Gb/s. The transceiver with an area of 0.117 mm2 enabled a bit error rate (BER) of 10 $^{-12}$  at 9.08-dB attenuation and had a power efficiency of 4.40 pJ/bit.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Integrated Multi-Phase Voltage Regulator With Flying-Capacitor-Based Inter-Inductor Current Self-Balancing Scheme and Charge-Recycling Gate Driver</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10430195</link><description>This article presents a fully integrated voltage regulator (FIVR) featuring a high power density, fast dynamic voltage scaling (DVS), and self-balanced inductor currents.

A dynamic power distribution (DPD) scheme is employed to adjust the duty ratios of the outputs based on changing load conditions. The WPDT system makes use of the different reflected impedances of the two outputs to enable reliable data transfer. Implemented in a standard 65-nm CMOS process, the system achieves an uplink data rate of 423.75 kb/s, confirmed through experiments with pseudorandom binary sequence input data at distances of 6, 10, and 15 mm. Notably, the measured maximum power transfer efficiency (PTE) at coil separation of 6, 10, and 15 mm are 62.7%, 50.8%, and 32.4%, respectively, with an overall improvement of more than 20% in light-load efficiency compared to previous approaches.</description></item><item><title>DiTTO: A Distance Adaptive Over 100-mW Wireless Power Transfer System With 1.695-Mb/s Uplink Telemetry and a Shared Inductor Two-Output Regulating Rectification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475412</link><description>This article presents a wireless power transfer (WPT) system that incorporates a seamless uplink data telemetry and a simultaneous shared inductor dual-output (SIDO) regulating rectification (RR) under distance variation over a single WPT link. The proposed double charging keying (DCK) uplink data modulation method assisted by a dynamic zoom control breaks the trade-off between power delivery to the load (PDL) and uplink data such that the high data-rate uplink data telemetry no longer limits the amount of PDLs. Furthermore, DCK alleviates the design difficulty in simultaneous uplink data telemetry and RR. The dynamic ZOOM-based digital control algorithm is employed to ensure reliable uplink data telemetry and rapid transient response of SIDO-RR with two  $\Delta \Sigma $ -loops under distance variations. This work achieves 1.695-Mb/s uplink data rate while delivering up to 108 mW to two independent loads over 10&#8211;42-mm single-link distance. The chip fabricated in standard 65-nm CMOS occupies 0.2-mm2 active area and its performance is validated through in vivo experiments.</description></item><item><title>A High Common-Mode Transient Immunity GaN-on-SOI Gate Driver With Quad-Drive Control Technique for High dV/dt 1700-V SiC Power Switch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10506900</link><description>This article proposes a gallium nitride (GaN)-based isolated silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET gate driver with an on-chip metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;metal (MIM) capacitor that has high data rate and low propagation delay. The improved common-mode transient immunity (CMTI) envelope detection technique eliminates the common-mode current ( $I_{\mathrm {CM}}$ ) to improve the CMTI. In addition, the proposed isolated gate driver (IGD) with quad-drive control (QDC) technique reduces power loss and gate ringing effect.

Battery-free communication based on wireless power transfer (WPT) can eliminate the battery to reduce the size of a wireless implant, realizing minimally invasive surgery. However, conventional battery-free implants suffer from a short communication range, such as inductive coupling, near-infrared (NIR) transmission, and active body-channel communication (BCC), which cannot apply to deep brain zones. Ultrasonic power transfer and communication benefit from a low channel loss, but the low carrier frequency leads to a low data rate, which is not able to transfer full-span neural signals such as spikes and multichannel signals. In this work, a galvanically-switching passive-BCC technique is proposed for neural implants, to extend the effective range of both power transfer and wireless communication. The brain tissue is utilized to form a galvanic loop for power delivery, while the neural-recording data switch the loop current to conduct passive BCC. The proposed technique is implemented in a neural recording chip fabricated in a 55-nm CMOS process. Through-tissue measurement shows that the chip realizes a battery-free communication range of 5.5 cm, with a bit-error rate (BER) of  $4.4 \times 10^{-6}$ . In the in-vivo demonstration, a 5.9-mm3 flexible prototype with the proposed chip inside is fully implanted into a Sprague&#8211;Dawley rat, where the neural signals are read battery-free through the passive-BCC technique.</description></item><item><title>A 125 &#956; m-Pitch-Matched Transceiver ASIC With Micro-Beamforming ADC and Multi-Level Signaling for 3-D Transfontanelle Ultrasonography</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418877</link><description>This article presents a pitch-matched transceiver application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for a wearable ultrasound device intended for transfontanelle ultrasonography, which includes element-level 20-V unipolar pulsers with transmit (TX) beamforming, and receive (RX) circuitry that combines eightfold multiplexing, four-channel micro-beamforming ( $\mu $ BF), and subgroup-level digitization to achieve an initial 32-fold channel-count reduction. The  $\mu $ BF is based on passive boxcar integration, merged with a 10-bit 40 MS/s SAR ADC in the charge domain, thus obviating the need for explicit anti-alias filtering (AAF) and power-hungry ADC drivers. A compact and low-power reference generator employs an area-efficient MOS capacitor as a reservoir to quickly set a reference for the ADC in the charge domain. A low-power multi-level data link, based on 16-level pulse-amplitude modulation, concatenates the outputs of four ADCs, providing an overall 128-fold channel-count reduction. A prototype transceiver ASIC was fabricated in a 180-nm BCD technology, and interfaces with a 2-D PZT transducer array of  $16\times16$  elements with a pitch of  $125 ~\mu \text{m}$  and a center frequency of 9 MHz. The ASIC consumes 1.83 mW/element. The data link achieves an aggregate 3.84 Gb/s data rate with 3.3 pJ/bit energy efficiency. The ASIC&#8217;s functionality has been demonstrated through electrical, acoustic, and imaging experiments.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Dynamic Event-Driven Capacitive Sensor Interface Circuits Based on Self-Reconfigurable SAR Capacitance-to-Digital Conversion for High-Density Robotic Tactile Sensing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10436653</link><description>Covering robots entirely with electronic skins (e-skins) has been a long-term aspiration. However, the number and density of the tactile sensors are limited by factors such as routing complexity, signal latency, and power consumption. Inspired by neural signal processing, we present a multichannel capacitive interface circuits that read out the sparse tactile signals in an event-driven (ED) manner. A self-reconfigurable successive-approximation-register capacitance-to-digital converter (SR SAR CDC) is proposed to reduce power consumption in passive-sampling (PS) mode and to achieve high resolution in noise-shaping (NS) mode. To support parallel recording in NS data converters, we propose a 2 $^{N}$  oversampling-rate (2 $^{N}$ -OSR) code division multiplexing (CDM) technique. Besides, an ED inter-integrated circuit (ED-I2C) protocol is proposed to reduce communication data burden and routing complexity. Fabricated in 55-nm CMOS technology, the multichannel capacitive sensor interface occupies a chip area of 2.244 mm $^{\textrm {2}}$ . At a frame rate of 3.47 kHz, this work achieves a measured single-channel signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) of 51 dB and a power consumption of 7.2  $\mu \text{W}$ /Ch in NS mode. The stand-by power can be further reduced to 1.6  $\mu \text{W}$ /Ch in PS mode. The ED sensing protocol significantly reduces the data burden for processing and communication, supporting a high-density integration of 4.8 sensors/cm $^{\textrm {2}}$  and 16 sensors/wire.</description></item><item><title>A 28-nm Floating-Point Computing-in-Memory Processor Using Intensive-CIM Sparse-Digital Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10438365</link><description>Computing-in-memory (CIM) chips have demonstrated promising high energy efficiency on multiply&#8211;accumulate (MAC) operations for artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Though integral (INT) CIM chips are emerging, the floating-point (FP) CIM chip has not been well explored. The high-accuracy demand of larger models and complex tasks requires FP computation. Besides, most of the neural network (NN) training tasks still rely on FP computation. This work presents an energy-efficient FP CIM processor. It is observed that most of the exponent values of FP data are concentrated in a small region. Therefore, the FP computations are divided into intensive and sparse parts and then executed on an intensive-CIM sparse-digital architecture. First, an FP-to-INT CIM workflow for the intensive FP operations is designed to reduce the CIM execution cycles. Second, a flexible sparse-digital core is proposed for the remaining sparse FP operations. Utilizing both the intensive-CIM and sparse-digital cores, this work can achieve both high energy efficiency and identical accuracy to the FP algorithm baseline. Considering the FP CIM execution flow, a CIM-friendly low-bit FP training method is proposed to further reduce the execution cycles. Besides, a low-MAC-value (MACV) CIM macro is designed to utilize the more random sparsity brought by FP alignment. The 28-nm fabricated chip shows 275&#8211;1615-TOPS/W@INT4 and 17.2&#8211;91.3-TOPS/W@FP16 macro energy efficiency from dense to the average sparsity on the tested models.</description></item><item><title>RoboVisio: A Micro-Robot Vision Domain-Specific SoC for Autonomous Navigation Enabling Fully-on-Chip Intelligence via 2-MB eMRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10445424</link><description>This article presents RoboVisio, an efficient and highly flexible domain-specific system-on-chip (SoC) for vision tasks in fully autonomous micro-robot navigation. A novel hybrid processing element (PE) is proposed, in which classic vision tasks achieve high efficiency by using a 2-D-mapping architecture, while convolutional neural network (CNN) is executed in an efficient output-channel-parallel systolic manner. Combining both processing schemes into a single PE array future-proofs the architecture, facilitating next-generation CNN-heavy vision algorithms, while saving 40% area and leakage with no power overhead and throughput loss, compared with two separate array implementations. To further improve energy and area efficiency, the design incorporates a number of key features: 1) 2-MB magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) for non-volatile fully-on-chip weight storage; 2) a unified image-activation memory (IAMEM) with block-swapping-based input/output image buffering that reduces buffer footprint by 50% and eliminates data copy for multi-frame buffering; and 3) a combination of weight buffering and CNN loop ordering that reduces weight memory system power by 75%. Fabricated in 22-nm CMOS, the design achieves 0.22 nJ/pixels for Harris corner feature detection (a classic or non-CNN vision task) and 3.5 TOPS/W (16-bit OP) for CNN, a 40%&#8211;170% efficiency improvement over state-of-the-art edge machine learning (ML) SoCs using non-volatile memory (NVM).</description></item><item><title>FlexSpin: A CMOS Ising Machine With 256 Flexible Spin Processing Elements With 8-b Coefficients for Solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10412172</link><description>Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are essential in various applications, including data clustering, supply chain management, and communication networks. Many real-world COPs are non-deterministic polynomial-time hard problems intractable using classical computers. Ising machine, the hardware accelerator based on the Ising model and annealing operation, has gained much attention as an alternative for solving COPs. The COPs are mapped to the Ising model, and their optimal/near-optimal solutions are explored by the intrinsic convergence property of the Ising machine. However, prior Ising machines based on locally connected spins have limitations in solving hard COPs due to significant overhead while mapping the Ising model to the inflexible hardware topology. In this work, we propose a scalable CMOS Ising machine with a network of flexible processing elements (PEs) to map and solve complex COPs with minimal overhead. The proposed Ising machine implements 256 PEs, where each PE is reconfigured to 1-to-4 spins with 28 spin interactions based on 8-bit coefficients. A 65-nm prototype chip has been fabricated, and a range of COPs have been mapped and solved, including max-cut and Boolean satisfiability problems.</description></item><item><title>SP-PIM: A Super-Pipelined Processing-In-Memory Accelerator With Local Error Prediction for Area/Energy-Efficient On-Device Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10471387</link><description>Over the past few years, on-device learning (ODL) has become an integral aspect of the success of edge devices that embrace machine learning (ML) since it plays a crucial role in restoring ML model accuracy when the edge environment changes. However, implementing ODL on battery-limited edge devices poses significant challenges due to the generation of large-size intermediate data during ML training and the frequent data movement between the processor and memory, resulting in substantial power consumption. To address this limitation, certain ML accelerators in edge devices have adopted a processing-in-memory (PIM) paradigm, integrating computing logic into memory. Nevertheless, these accelerators still face hurdles such as long latency caused by the lack of a pipelined approach in the training process, notable power and area overheads related to floating-point arithmetic, and incomplete handling of data sparsity during training. This article presents a high-throughput super-pipelined PIM accelerator, named SP-PIM, designed to overcome the limitations of existing PIM-based ODL accelerators. To this end, SP-PIM implements a holistic multi-level pipelining scheme based on local error prediction (EP), enhancing training speed by 7.31 $\times $ . In addition, SP-PIM introduces a local EP unit (LEPU), a lightweight circuit that performs accurate EP leveraging power-of-two (PoT) random weights. This strategy significantly reduces power-hungry external memory access (EMA) by 59.09%. Moreover, SP-PIM fully exploits sparsities in both activation and error data during training, facilitated by a highly optimized PIM macro design. Finally, the SP-PIM chip, fabricated using 28-nm CMOS technology, achieves a training speed of 8.81 epochs/s. It occupies a die area of 5.76 mm2 and consumes between 6.91 and 433.25 mW at operating frequencies of 20&#8211;450 MHz with a supply voltage of 0.56&#8211;1.05 V. We demonstrate that it can successfully execute end-to-end ODL for the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets. Consequently, it achieves state-of-the-art area efficiency (560.6 GFLOPS/mm2) and competitive power efficiency (22.4 TFLOPS/W), marking a 3.95 $\times $  higher figure-of-merit (area efficiency  $\times $  power efficiency  $\times $  capacity) than previous work. Furthermore, we implemented a cycle-level simulator using Python to investigate and validate the scalability of SP-PIM. By doing architectural experiments in various hardware configurations, we successfully verified that the core computing unit within SP-PIM possesses both scale-up and scale-out capabilities.</description></item><item><title>iMCU: A 28-nm Digital In-Memory Computing-Based Microcontroller Unit for TinyML</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10436137</link><description>Tiny machine learning (TinyML) envisions executing a deep neural network (DNN)-based inference on an edge device for improving battery life, latency, security, and privacy. Toward this vision, recent microcontroller units (MCUs) integrate in-memory computing (IMC) hardware to leverage its high energy efficiency and throughput in vector&#8211;matrix multiplication (VMM). However, those existing works require large IMC hardware, severely increasing the area overhead. In addition, most existing works use analog&#8211;mixed-signal (AMS) IMC hardware, exhibiting limited robustness over process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Finally, none can support a practical software development framework such as TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TFLite-micro). Due to these limitations, those MCUs did not present the performance for the standard benchmark MLPerf-Tiny, which makes it difficult to evaluate them against the state-of-the-art neural (not necessarily IMC-based) MCUs. In this article, we design a new IMC-based MCU, titled iMCU, for TinyML to address those challenges. In the design process, we: 1) define the optimal set of acceleration targets and 2) devise an area-efficient computation flow that requires the least amount of IMC hardware yet still provides a significant acceleration. In addition, we develop: 1) state-of-the-art digital IMC macros and 2) create the accelerator based on the macros, which can support the proposed computation flow in a fully pipelined manner. Combining those innovations, we prototyped the iMCU in a 28-nm CMOS. The measurement results show that the iMCU significantly outperforms the prior IMC-based MCUs in compute density, energy efficiency, and SRAM density (total SRAM size/total SRAM area). It also achieves a compact footprint of 2.73 mm2.</description></item><item><title>Scaling-CIM: eDRAM In-Memory-Computing Accelerator With Dynamic-Scaling ADC and Adaptive Analog Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10438359</link><description>This article presents Scaling-computing-in-memory (CIM), an energy-efficient embedded dynamic random access memory (eDRAM)-based in-memory-computing (IMC) accelerator with a dynamic-scaling readout for signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) boosting and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) overhead reduction. It greatly saves the ADC cost by reducing the required number of ADC-bit and ADC operations by codesigning the algorithm and hardware. Scaling-CIM proposes three key features: 1) dynamic scaling ADC (DSA) boosts SQNR of multibit operation even with low-bit ADC; 2) adaptive analog bit-parallel (AABP) accumulation reduces the redundant ADC operation; and 3) layer-wise adaptive bit-truncation (LABT) search further enhances efficiency on benchmarks.

The proposed design achieves a stable unity gain by proposing a new pole and zero scheme with very low power consumption, drawing only 3.3 mA from a 1.8 V power supply while driving a load capacitor as large as 100pF. To achieve rail-to-rail input swing, the design uses both NMOS and PMOS differential pairs at the input and biases them in the subthreshold region to provide an identical net trans-conductance over the rail-to-rail input common mode. Furthermore, an adaptive biasing is employed and the current sources are kept ON during large signal transitions at the input, thus eliminating crossover distortion and providing a high slew rate of 40 V/ $\mu \text{s}$  at a 100 pF load capacitor. The design employs chopping at 2.5 MHz and is enhanced with a local ripple reduction loop, making the OpAmp suitable for high gain and wide bandwidth applications with less filtering required. The design also reduces the input bias current significantly from 500 nA to 1.5 nA by buffering the input and applying it to the modified bootstrap switches.

However, the need for a trade-off between the front-end gain and CCIA area, imposed by the input capacitance, restricts the miniaturization of such sensors. We propose a Complementary Transimpedance Boosting (CTB) technique to relieve this challenging gain versus area trade-off. The proposed CTB applies to both the DC and AC paths of a CCIA. CTB also reduces AC gain degradation, suppressing low-side gain peaking of the frequency response without significantly increasing input-referred noise. The Gain-Noise-Area Efficiency (GNA) and Gain-Power-Area Efficiency (GPA) factors are also introduced for holistic comparisons with other front-end amplifiers regarding noise, gain, and power consumption. CTB-based CCIAs (CTB-CCIA) are fabricated in  $0.18~\mu $ m CMOS, with the highest single-stage AC gain of 289 V/V achieved. Occupying only 0.011 mm2, a conventional CCIA with the same area will have  $14.4\times $  less gain while requiring at least two stages. The CTB-CCIA has a competitive NEF of 4.92 within a signal bandwidth of 0.21 Hz &#8211; 8.7 kHz, suitable for multi-channel applications.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Integrated 1 GHz 8A Imax Step-Down and Step-Up Switched Capacitor Voltage Regulator in 3 nm FinFET Technology Featuring Auto Mode Transition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10477169</link><description>This paper presents a fully integrated continuous-scalable conversion-ratio (CSCR) switched-capacitor voltage regulator (SCVR), capable of supporting a wide range of voltage conversion ratios and high load current for SOCs used in computing and other applications. This design can achieve both step-down and step-up voltage conversion and has phase-merged turbo modes to deliver higher output current. It can autonomously and dynamically transition between step-down and step-up modes based on conversion ratio and between regular and turbo modes depending on load current. This SCVR is designed using Intel&#8217;s 3nm FinFET technology and is capable of an output voltage range of 0.5V-1.2V from an input of 1.1V. Furthermore, the input voltage can be in the range 1.1-1.3V for the same output voltage range. It can deliver up to 8A of load current at a 1GHz flying capacitor switching frequency and exhibits a peak efficiency of 88%. This design minimizes the added die area for the converter by implementing the flying capacitors over the load domain and achieves a maximum active area power density of 14W/mm2. The converter uses a fast asynchronous voltage droop detector, in combination with auto-transition to turbo modes, to achieve excellent transient response-an output voltage droop of 37.5mV was measured for a fast (100ps) load current step from 0.1A to 6A. It also features configurable maximum switching frequency reduction and clock interleaving to achieve an output voltage ripple of 20mV.</description></item><item><title>A 0.65 V 4 dB NF 2.4 GHz Sub-Passive RF Down-Converter With Trans-Frequency Current-Reusing Scheme Achieving Low Flicker Noise and High Linearity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10533240</link><description>In this article, a 2.4 GHz low-power sub-passive radio frequency (RF) down-converter that employs trans-frequency current-reusing technique is proposed. Part of the RF trans-conductance ( $\bf {g_{m}}$ ) stage is reused as the bias current source of the trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) to realize trans-frequency current reusing, thereby saving 30% power consumption of the sub-passive down-converter. Compared with a conventional passive down-converter where the flicker noise from the TIA&#8217;s bias current source is fully fed into the intermediate frequency (IF) output terminal, the flicker noise originating from the TIA&#8217;s current source supplied by the RF  $\bf {g_{m}}$  stage is up-converted and filtered out. The flicker noise corner frequency is cut down to 20 KHz, making it possible to apply zero-IF receiver for narrow-band communications. The linearity is also improved by sufficiently cancelling third-order transconductance from PMOS and NMOS  $\bf {g_{m}}$  transistors across a wide input swing range, which is contributed by their asymmetrical bias current in the low-noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA). Fabricated in TSMC 40 nm RF CMOS process, the prototype occupies a die area of 0.27mm2. Operating at 2.4 GHz, the sub-passive RF down-converter achieves a measured conversion gain (CG) of 56 dB and a noise figure (NF) of 4 dB, while implementing a 23 dBm output third-order intercept point (OIP3) with 0.8 mW power consumption at a supply voltage of 0.65V.</description></item><item><title>A High Sensitivity CMOS Rectifier for 5G mm-Wave Energy Harvesting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10449887</link><description>This manuscript details the design and analysis of a CMOS rectifier in TSMC 65 nm for the 5G NR2 band and aims to overcome the challenge of achieving high rectified voltage while optimizing for PCE (power conversion efficiency).

However, they are difficult to be applied in three-dimensional (3D) circuits, where exist electric/magnetic resonances and mutual couplings. Herein, a general  $N+3$  coupling matrix is synthesized, which the 3D physical structure can be determined directly, regardless of specific lumped/distributed circuit values. The  $N+3$  matrix enables explicit efficiency calculation of the amplifiers as well as scattering parameters, which offers a comprehensive evaluation and prediction of the circuits&#8217; performances. Moreover, the coupling matrix facilitates easy integration of the on-chip transistor with the 3D high-Q resonators. Thus, conventional planar matching circuits can be removed, allowing for reduced losses and compact architecture. The technique will be more valuable for millimeter or terahertz waves as the operating frequencies, and therefore, planar circuit losses increase.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced Dual-Mode Reciprocal Doherty Power Amplifier Using Modified Combining Load and Parameter Sweeping Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415373</link><description>This article presents a theoretical analysis and circuit design for an enhanced dual-mode reciprocal Doherty power amplifier (DM-RDPA). To achieve bandwidth enhancement, an improved combining load design strategy is proposed, providing more accurate back-off impedance across a wider target bandwidth. Additionally, a sweeping analysis method is developed to determine optimal design parameters. The enhanced combining load design space of the proposed DM-RDPA is visualized, providing an intuitive view of the appropriate impedance solution space. To validate this enhanced DM-RDPA architecture and the corresponding design analysis method, a prototype PA was designed and fabricated using commercial GaN transistors. The implemented PA achieves two different Doherty operation bands: 0.95-1.9 GHz (66.7% fractional bandwidth) in Mode I and 0.67-0.93 GHz (32.5% fractional bandwidth) in Mode II. Drain efficiency of 47.3%-62.2% and 44.7%-62.1% is obtained by the fabricated DPA at 6 dB back-off in Mode I and Mode II, respectively. When driven by a 20 MHz modulated signal with 8 dB peak to average power ratio (PAPR), the fabricated DPA presents higher than 42% average efficiency in both Mode I and Mode II.</description></item><item><title>IIP2-Calibration-Free Receiver Front End With Notch-Filtered Low-Noise Transconductance Amplifier for 5G New Radio Cellular Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416724</link><description>This paper presents an input-referred second-order intercept point (IIP2)-calibration-free receiver (RX) front end with a notch-filtered low-noise transconductance amplifier (LNTA) for 5G new radio (NR) cellular applications. The LNTA adopts a proposed dual-band third-order LC notch filter with a band-switchable differential inductor with a center tap. It rejects transmitter leakage and out-of-band blockers. Consequently, the RX front end has enhanced blocker tolerance and meets the IIP2 requirement without any IIP2 calibration. The RX front end comprises the broadband LNTA with the dual-band LC notch filter, current-mode passive mixers with a 25% duty-cycle local oscillator signal, and transimpedance amplifiers. Fabricated through a 65 nm CMOS process, the RX front end was characterized primarily in the low band and mid band of 5G NR sub-6 GHz bands. It achieved a noise figure of 3.5 dB, conversion gain of 41.5 dB, out-of-band input-referred third-order intercept point of 2.1 dBm, and IIP2 of more than 59 dBm. It drew a bias current of 11.7 mA from a nominal supply voltage of 1 V.

The PA employs a series-combining transformer (SCT) in the output matching network to deliver high output power. To extract high passive efficiency of the output matching network both in the 2.4- and 5-GHz bands, a new efficiency-oriented design methodology of reconfigurable dual-band output matching network is proposed. Besides, the reconfigurable dual-band inter-stage matching network using power splitting structure is introduced. Based on the proposed methodology, the PA is designed and fabricated in 40-nm CMOS technology, and the passive efficiencies of the implemented output matching network are 70.3% and 73.8% at 2.4 and 5.5 GHz respectively. For continuous-wave, the proposed PA achieves a saturated power ( $\text{P}_{\mathrm {sat}}$ ) of 25.4 and 24.4-24.8 dBm with power-added efficiency (PAE) of 25% and 20.8-27.3% in the 2.4- and 5-GHz WLAN bands, respectively. The proposed PA outperforms other reconfigurable dual-band or multi-band PAs in terms of the efficiency. When testing with 802.11ax signal with 1024-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), a -35-dB error vector magnitude (EVM) specification can be satisfied in the 2.4- and 5-GHz bands.</description></item><item><title>Protecting the Intellectual Property of Binary Deep Neural Networks With Efficient Spintronic-Based Hardware Obfuscation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10532138</link><description>Well-trained deep neural network (DNN) models are considered valuable assets because they require large amounts of data, expertise, and resources to achieve desired performance. Hence, protecting the intellectual property of such hard-to-develop models against unauthorized usage or model leaking is a significant concern. This paper proposes a novel key-based obfuscation method that locks the model with a significant accuracy drop when the incorrect key is applied. Due to the importance and developments of binary neural networks (BNNs) in hardware implementation of state-of-the-art DNN models, we study our method on BNNs. The proposed model protection solution leads to a higher accuracy drop with even a lower perturbation rate across different binary neural network architectures and benchmark datasets than its state-of-the-art counterpart. Furthermore, we present an efficient spintronic-based in-memory computing structure for the hardware implementation of the proposed method. We validate the proposed design using post-layout simulations based on the TSMC 40nm technology. With the same approach for hardware implementation, our proposed design provides, on average, 18%, 41%, and 40% improvements regarding the area, average power consumption, and weight modification energy per filter in the neural network structure, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Clock Period-Jitter Measurement With Low-Noise Runtime Calibration for Chips in FinFET CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10477395</link><description>Process migration from bulk to FinFET CMOS pronounces die-to-die and within-die process variations. Runtime variations get severe as the clock frequency goes higher. Facing these two issues makes on-chip clock period-jitter measurement with a high resolution very difficult. In this work, we propose low-noise runtime resolution calibration and jitter measurement for designing a period-jitter measurement circuit, called a period-jitter sensor (PJS), in the face of higher variations imposed on the PJS. Essential design techniques include edge-triggered and symmetrical architecture and circuits for noise reduction, variation resiliency, and power saving. As a test vehicle, we have designed a PJS to measure the clock quality of an LPDDR4-4266 physical layer with the clock cycle time and the maximum period jitter specified to be 468.82ps and &#177;30ps, respectively. The design specifies the minimum runtime resolution to be better than 1.0 ps. Measurement results show that the 0.0192mm $^{2}~2.133$ GHz PJS in 14nm FinFET CMOS achieves a sub-ps resolution in runtime and only consumes around 1mW across all PVT conditions, making multiple embedding of the PJS in a complex SoC feasible.</description></item><item><title>Novel Radiation Hardened Pre-Discharge Sense Amplifier for Double Data Rate Magnetic Random Access Memory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10517868</link><description>The ever-increasing demand for non-volatile memories with high density, low power consumption, and resistance to radiation has led to the emergence of Double Data Rate Magnetic Random Access Memory (DDR-MRAM) as a promising technology. However, the reliability of DDR-MRAM in harsh radiation environments remains a challenge. This paper presents a novel radiation-hardened pre-discharge sense amplifier specifically designed for DDR-MRAM application. The paper investigates the effects of radiation on the unhardened pre-discharge sense amplifier (PDSA) circuit and proposes solutions at both the device and circuit levels. At the circuit level, two distinct circuits have been proposed: one involves the duplication technique (PDSA-D) and the other employs a feedback circuitry (RT-PDSA) to harden sensitive transistors in the PDSA. The proposed radiation tolerant PDSA (RT-PDSA) circuit demonstrates significant improvements in terms of single event upset (SEU) as well as double node upset (DNU) mitigation by considering minimum sensitive nodes layout area separation concept and enhanced compared to unhardened PDSA circuit. The overall performance of the proposed circuit has been analyzed in terms of the figure of merit (FOM), which includes critical charge tolerability, the number of sensitive nodes, recovery time, and area. The proposed RT-PDSA circuit has  $11.95\times $  and  $8.7\times $  higher FOM compared to the hardened PDSA at the device level, and PDSA-D circuit, respectively. Moreover, the proposed circuit exhibits robustness against process variations, making it a promising solution for enhancing DDR-MRAM&#8217;s reliability in radiation-intensive environments.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Efficient and High-Throughput CNN Inference Engine Based on Memory-Sharing and Data-Reusing for Edge Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521770</link><description>This paper proposes implementation-friendly and dynamically reconfigurable VLSI-algorithm for convolutional neural network (CNN) inference engine.

Achieved through algorithm and hardware co-optimizations, we propose a compact recurrent spiking neural network with two recurrent layers, one fully connected layer, and a low time step (1 or 2). The 2.79-MB model undergoes pruning and 4-bit fixed-point quantization, shrinking it by 96.42% to 0.1 MB. On the hardware front, we take advantage of mixed-level pruning, zero-skipping and merged spike techniques, reducing complexity by 90.49% to 13.86 MMAC/S. The parallel time-step execution addresses inter-time-step data dependencies and enables weight buffer power savings through weight sharing. Capitalizing on the sparse spike activity, an input broadcasting scheme eliminates zero computations, further saving power. Implemented on the TSMC 28-nm process, the design operates in real time at 100 kHz, consuming  $71.2~\mu $ W, surpassing state-of-the-art designs. At 500 MHz, it has 28.41 TOPS/W and 1903.11 GOPS/mm2 in energy and area efficiency, respectively.</description></item><item><title>PipeCIM: A High-Throughput Computing-In-Memory Microprocessor With Nested Pipeline and RISC-V Extended Instructions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504552</link><description>The large number of multiply accumulate (MAC) operations in Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) leads to substantial data migration and computation. Although computing-in-memory (CIM) proves to be a promising paradigm for MAC operations, high throughput CNN accelerator still confronts bottlenecks from: the low MAC utilization and the uncessary off-chip memory access. In this paper, we propose a high throughput CIM-based CNN accelerator PipeCIM with three hierarchies of pipelines: Intra-Macro, Near-Memory and Tile-Level. The Intra-Macro Pipeline parallelly executes data transfer and in-memory-computing (IMC) operations. The Near-Memory Pipeline alleviates memory access for pooling and data reshaping. The Tile-Level Pipeline establishes a layer-wise pipeline to further improve the throughput while reducing control complexity. PipeCIM introduces the nested scheme and a Unidirectional Divergent Connection Protocol (UDTCP) to simplify the control of data flow with the help of customized RISC-V instructions. To validate our design, PipeCIM was prototyped in 55 nm process node, achieving energy efficiency of 133.8 TOPS/W and peak throughput of 819 GOPS with a 16KB CIM array, which can accelerate VGG-16 to  $128.56\times $  or Inception to  $19.754\times $  compared to the baseline.</description></item><item><title>Design of Optoelectronic In-Sensor Computing Circuit Based on Memristive Crossbar Array for In Situ Edge Extraction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10518003</link><description>The rapid development of artificial intelligence has brought a huge amount of data, and the traditional image processing architecture that separates sensing, storage and computation will face the problems of high power consumption and processing latency. Focusing on these problems, this paper proposed a design scheme of memristor-based optoelectronic sensing circuit, which can integrate image perception, storage, and processing into one entity. Without large-scale data transmission and conversion, the corresponding energy consumption can be avoided effectively. Firstly, an optoelectronic sensing circuit based on memristive crossbar array is proposed, which realizes the acquisition and in situ storage of image information by embedding the photoelectric converters into the memristive array. On this basis, the corresponding peripheral circuit is designed to accomplish the in situ edge feature extraction for the stored image. The extraction process is large-scale parallel computing in the analog domain, and the speed is significantly improved compared with the traditional solution. Moreover, the extraction accuracy of the circuit can reach more than 99%, and it also can withstand a certain degree of programming error and has strong robustness.</description></item><item><title>Graph Attention Networks to Identify the Impact of Transistor Degradation on Circuit Reliability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10535497</link><description>Reliability is one of the key concerns in circuit design. The circuit must be able to tolerate transistor degradation to sustain reliability against timing failure. Whether a transistor is degraded due to noise, aging, or poor manufacturing, a circuit must uphold a timing error-free functionality over its entire projected lifetime. Transistors are hardened (designed stronger than necessary) to tolerate these degradations. However, hardening (e.g., widening the transistors) comes at the cost of additional area and power. Hence, it is necessary to identify and selectively harden specific transistors within a circuit. In this work, transistors that prolong a circuit&#8217;s delay when they are degraded are termed &#8220;susceptible&#8221;, and thus, are to be hardened. Identifying the susceptible transistors within a circuit is a complex task, for example, Monte Carlo circuit simulations require days to identify susceptible transistors in a single circuit. Consequently, current solutions are costly in terms of time and limited in their application. Instead, machine learning (ML) can offer a fast (inference in seconds) and universal (applicable to unseen circuits) alternative. However, traditional ML techniques struggle with inference on topology-based problems, while recent graph neural networks (GNNs) excel in these applications. Therefore, this work presents the first ML to classify susceptible transistors with GNNs. We use GNNs, specifically Graph Attention Networks (GAT), because the topology of the cell strongly affects how each transistor degradation affects performance. For instance, series-connected transistors amplify their impact, while parallel-connected ones can offset each other&#8217;s influence. Our GAT-based approach employs a heterogeneous graph in combination with GAT&#8217;s attention mechanism to capture the circuit&#8217;s topology and its impact on the analysis. Our evaluation demonstrates the capability of our approach to classifying transistors according to their impact within the ASAP7 standard cell library&#8217;s standard cells in mere 0.04 s (compared to days of Monte Carlo simulation time) while achieving 80.4% accuracy on unseen circuits.</description></item><item><title>Comprehensive Diagnosis Strategy for Power Switch, Grid-Side Current Sensor, DC-Link Voltage Sensor Faults in Single-Phase Three-Level Rectifiers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10513436</link><description>Accurate fault detection and localization are essential for single-phase three-level (SPTL) rectifier systems with high reliability requirements. However, power switch faults, grid-side current sensor (CS) faults, and DC-link voltage sensor (VS) faults can all contribute to distorted output in the rectifier system, posing challenges for existing diagnostic methods tailored for single-type faults, as they struggle to distinguish between these various faults. Therefore, this study proposes a comprehensive diagnosis technology for open-circuit (OC) faults, CS faults, and VS faults of SPTL rectifiers on the basis of a reduced-order observer. To achieve this, the method begins by expanding and transforming the state equation of the rectifier with faults, ensuring complete decoupling of the OC fault vector from the initial system states and sensor faults. Subsequently, an assessment of the initial system state, CS faults, and VS faults is achieved via the design of a reduced-order observer. Using these estimation results, fault detection variable and its adaptive thresholds is designed, along with fault-distinguishing variables to differentiate between sensor faults and OC faults. Simultaneously, sensor fault identification method and OC fault location method are introduced. Finally, the validity and resilience of the comprehensive diagnostic approach are confirmed through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test results under diverse scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Sampled-Data Control for Buck-Boost Converter Using a Switched Affine Systems Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10453340</link><description>This paper focuses on the sampled-data control for a DC-DC buck-boost converter, which is modeled as a class of continuous-time switched affine systems (SASs). The controller of the closed-loop system, in which both the control inputs and switching signals are sampled-data-dependent, is designed to ensure convergence of the system state to a specified region. This region comprises multiple ellipsoids centered around some shifted points that need to be determined, which can better characterize the convergence region under non-uniform sampling intervals. By introducing a switching multi-shifted-point-dependent Lyapunov functional, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure practical stability of the presented SASs. The proposed design scheme generalizes the switching quadratic Lyapunov function based method, and provides a smaller and more accurate invariant set. Moreover, the method is extended to SASs with uncertainties, and the corresponding robust stability conditions are provided. Finally, the superiority of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a case study of a DC motor driven by a buck-boost converter.</description></item><item><title>A 43.9 &#956;s IRS Controller SoC With Grid-Based Phase-Shift Optimization in 28 nm CMOS Technology for Next- Generation Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10529718</link><description>Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is one of the promising technologies for next-generation communication systems. Although IRS can enhance the integrity of the transmitted signal, however, it requires additional phase-shift optimization task, potentially increasing the total processing latency of the system. To implement a phase-shift optimization algorithm with low-latency, for the world-first, IRS controller SoC for saving the base station (BS) transmit (TX) antenna power is presented with novel latency reduction techniques; 1) grid-based phase-shift elements with a coarse-grained update, 2) quality-aware approximate processing element with low-resolution saturation arithmetic, 3) optimized data-flow scheduling with double-buffer architecture, and 4) novel low-latency weight update tracking technique. By adopting the proposed techniques, the fully-optimized SoC architecture can enhance the processing latency and energy consumption by 93% and 68%, respectively, compared with the unoptimized SoC architecture. The proposed system is designed and fabricated in 28 nm CMOS technology, where the implementation results show that the fully-optimized SoC system can achieve  $43.9~\mu $ s of processing latency while saving 14.5 dB of TX antenna power for optimizing the  $16\times 16$  grid-based IRS architecture with  $128\times 8$  MU-MIMO configuration.</description></item><item><title>Design of Miniaturized Sub-6 GHz Rectifier With Self-Impedance Matching Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10532127</link><description>This work presents a novel concept of self-impedance matching in rectifier design by integrating a driving rectifier in parallel with a conventional voltage doubler circuit. The input impedance of the wideband rectifier is perfectly matched with the use of driving rectifier, which consists of a half-wave rectifier, a series stub line, and a grounding capacitor. The series stub adjusts the operating frequency and the efficiency bandwidth (EBW) of the proposed rectifier. This approach streamlines the rectifier design by eliminating additional input impedance matching networks and offers simultaneous control of EBW and operating bandwidth. Instead of a conventional lossy microstrip line, a Defected Ground Structure (DGS) is employed to design a high-impedance series stub line which makes the proposed circuit compact with improved quality factor. The experimental results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed rectifier, achieving more than 50% power conversion efficiency (PCE) for the frequency range of 3 GHz to 5.8 GHz, covering entire sub-6 GHz band of the 5G network with minimal variation.

This approach involves sharing one rectifying network (i.e., the common items) between two or more parallel rectifiers, thereby significantly simplifying the design process. In contrast to the traditional global optimization method for multi-band (e.g., &gt;3 bands) rectifier design, our RNCIE strategy can help realize the modular decomposition of the rectifier, including the rectifying network and impedance matching network (with the help of filter branches), thus leading to a significant reduction in design cost and complexity. Additionally, the unique advantage of the RNCIE contributes to in-depth analysis of the influencing factors on the total efficiency of the rectifier. Consequently, the RF-DC conversion efficiency of an example prototype of the rectifier design can be optimized to 44.6% @ 1.8 GHz, 45.4% @ 2.1 GHz, 41.7% @ 2.6 GHz, 33% @ 3.5 GHz, 30.2% @ 4.9 GHz, and 23% @ 5.8 GHz at an input power level of &#8722;10 dBm. Meanwhile, our rectifier with a shared rectifying network can improve the total efficiency when multi-tone signal inputs are used (27% @ &#8722;20 dBm, 43% @ &#8722;10 dBm for a six-tone signal). The strategy is verified by experimental measurements and paves the way for the efficient and accurate design of multi-band rectifiers of high efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Wide-Input-Range Time-Based Buck Converter With Adaptive Gain and Continuous Phase Preset for Seamless PFM/PWM Transitions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10464357</link><description>In this paper, a wide-input-range buck converter with a dual time-based PWM and PFM control is presented.

Digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) existing on the ZU28DR RFSoC are used as digital front-ends of the transmitter (TX) and the receiver (RX), respectively.

The proposed technique samples data at the data edge per 2-unit intervals (UIs). When the data transition occurs, the comparator generates the decision error because the cross point does not have a vertical margin. To have a sufficient vertical margin, the proposed RX uses a high-pass filter (HPF) for the correct decision. In contrast, when there is no data transition, the comparator generates the correct decision without the HPF because the vertical margin of the data is already large. For the proposed DE sampling, the RX requires an HPF and two comparators that receive the input and output of the HPF. The inputs of the two comparators with different vertical margins generate the decision time differences between the two comparators. A time-based transition detector (TBTD) uses these decision time differences to determine whether a data transition has occurred.

Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) is typically employed for down-sampling to reduce the size of point cloud and enhance the representational capability by preserving contour points in point cloud analysis. However, due to low parallelism and high computational complexity, high energy consumption and long latency are caused, which becomes a bottleneck of hardware acceleration. In this brief, we propose an adjustable multi-stream block-wise FPS algorithm, adjusted by four configurable parameters, according to hardware and accuracy requirements. A unified hardware architecture with one parameter is designed to implement the adjustable multi-stream block-wise FPS algorithm.

Energy harvesting systems have a high potential for deployment in WSN to monitor natural environments and industrial equipment. With limited resources, including power and chip area, an energy harvesting system demands thorough resource allocation to several circuits like a control system, sensors, and a transceiver. Also, such systems are required to function with low-peak power to adapt to the fluctuation of harvested energy. This brief presents a System-on-Chip (SoC) featuring a tiny 16-bit processor for batteryless systems.

Specifically, the proposed structure uses a coupled transmission line (CTL) connected in shunt at the diode anode to suppress the second harmonic of three frequencies concurrently while adopting well with a TB fundamental matching network, enabling an efficient TB power recycling mechanism for efficiency enhancement with a miniature size. The CTL operation is investigated in the closed-form equations. For validation, a Schottky diode-based rectifier is simulated, fabricated, and measured.

By analyzing the instantaneous power in the two-phase stationary frame, an improved algorithm to reconstruct input voltages is proposed to realize constant active power. The proposed control strategy does not require phase-lock loop and therefore can be applied in wide ac input frequency application. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Fast-Processing Implementation Method of Virtual Space Vector Modulation for the Impedance-Source Three-Level Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10422850</link><description>The impedance-source (IS) three-level inverter has been put forward to implement buck-boost operation and obtain multi-level output waveforms.

According to the relationship of three-phase modulation waves, a proper differential-mode voltage injection scheme is developed to control the NPV balance actively. In order to boost the dc input voltage, the maximum and minimum modulation waves are further moved upwards and downwards, and the shoot-through (ST) states are properly generated without affecting the normal ac output voltage. Doing so, the VSVM strategy for IS three-level inverter is simply implemented by carrier-based modulation (CBM) approach.

However, this type of method is susceptible to bad pixels. Although some sorting-based algorithms can correct these bad pixels, the corresponding storage and computation overheads are large. To solve this problem, this brief proposes a new black-level correction method: the Iterative Median-Averaged Adaptive Black-Level Correction Method (IMA-BLC). The proposed method can remove the effect of bad pixels by shifting the filter window and obtaining median values in consecutive intervals with low hardware overhead. The average of all median values is then calculated to provide the statistically significant black level value. We have implemented the IMA-BLC framework on the FPGA platform. The proposed method has the lowest hardware cost and power consumption compared to some common black level correction methods with bad pixel correction capability.</description></item><item><title>Multiobjective Optimization for PSIJ Mitigation and Impedance Improvement Based on PCPS/DR-NSDE in Chiplet-Based 2.5-D Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10436422</link><description>The utilization of modular chiplets in interposer-based 2.5-D heterogeneous systems simplifies fabrication and design, however, it also introduces significant noise challenges. This article presents a collaborative jitter-aware optimization in 2.5-D integrated circuits (ICs), incorporating power supply induced jitter (PSIJ), system impedance, target impedance, and decoupling capacitors, based on the hybrid precomputation and prestorage/duplicate removal-nondominated sorting differential evolution (PCPS/DR-NSDE) algorithm. An automatic channel model algorithm and a uniform decoupling capacitor placement strategy are proposed to improve the design efficiency. Then, the system transfer impedance, simultaneous switch current, sensitivity function, and amplification factor are individually modeled, leading to the assembly and verification of the final PSIJ in the 2.5-D system. A precomputation and prestorage (PCPS) strategy is proposed to handle high-time-consuming modules in the objective function and a duplicate removal (DR) operation is added to improve algorithm performance. The proposed PCPS/DR-NSDE is faster than traditional algorithms and has optimal hypervolume and coverage-metric (C-metric) indicators. The procedures for further obtaining desired solutions in the Pareto front are discussed. The impact of practical constraints and target impedance is also analyzed. This work provides a collaborative optimization and analysis of jitter, noise, and impedance in 2.5-D systems.</description></item><item><title>Congestion-Aware Vertical Link Placement and Application Mapping Onto 3-D Network-on-Chip Architectures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10453351</link><description>3-D Network-on-Chip (NoC) technology has emerged as a compelling solution in modern System-on-Chip (SoC) designs. This NoC technology effectively addresses the escalating need for high-performance and energy-efficient on-chip communication in various applications, including high-performance computing (HPC), graphics processing units (GPUs), and multiprocessor SoCs (MPSoCs). However, the efficient mapping of applications onto 3-D Network-on-Chips (3-D NoC) remains a complex challenge, necessitating the development of improved algorithms to address the issue. In this context, we present a novel neural mapping model with a reinforcement learning (RL) approach (NeurMap3D) to design application-specific 3-D NoC-based IC. Additionally, we propose the neural congestion-aware through-silicon vias (TSVs) placement and application mapping (NCTPAM) approach, which not only addresses application mapping but also incorporates TSVs placement and load balance across the TSVs for the specific application. In order to reduce the CPU execution time of NCTPAM algorithm, we propose incorporating a partial model parameter  $(\theta)$  update mechanism. Experimental results indicate improved performance in terms of minimizing communication cost, load balancing across TSVs and energy consumption, highlighting the potential of our approach to enhance the efficiency of these synthesized network architectures.</description></item><item><title>3D-TemPo: Optimizing 3-D DRAM Performance Under Temperature and Power Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10439997</link><description>3-D DRAM provides a significant performance boost resulting from substantial memory bandwidth. However, the stacked memory architecture exhibits high power density, causing thermal hotspots. Further, systems under power constraints require careful planning for intelligent allocation of the available power to their various components. A straightforward dynamic power management policy of allocating more power to potentially high memory activity 3-D DRAM ranks so as to maximize system performance causes a rise in the temperature of such ranks, making them susceptible to thermal stalls and shutdown by dynamic thermal management (DTM) strategies. A rise in rank temperature, in turn, increases the leakage power of memory ranks, affecting power budgeting decisions. Thus, a coordinated strategy for power budgeting and thermal management is needed. We propose an adjacency-aware dynamic power budgeting technique, 3D-TemPo, which dynamically performs a reward-based power allocation to memory ranks, in order to maximize 3-D DRAM performance under power and thermal constraints, and is sensitive to strong thermal correlations between vertically adjacent ranks. We evaluate 3D-TemPo using SPEC CPU2017 and PARSEC 2.1 benchmark suites and observe speedups of  $1\times $  to  $17.94\times $  compared to baseline strategies.</description></item><item><title>Fast and Scaled Counting-Based Stochastic Computing Divider Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10436412</link><description>This article presents novel designs for stochastic computing (SC)-based dividers, which promise low latency, high energy efficiency, as well as high accuracy for error-tolerant arithmetic operations. We first introduce CBDIV, which is based on the recently proposed counter-based SC concept and correlation-based SC to perform division. Then, we introduce FSCDIV, which further improves the accuracy of CBDIV by applying a scaling strategy and mitigating the latency by optimizing the counting scheme. The FSCDIV will equally scale up the divider and dividend before the division process, and thereby avoid large relative error when both input values of the divider and dividend are small. The proposed fast counting method accelerates FSCDIV by counting new bit pair (0&#8211;1 pair) among only half of the stochastic number bitstream instead of the entire bitstream, resulting in almost half of the counting latency and one-fourth of the overall division operation latency. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CBDIV, implemented in a 32-nm technology node, outperforms state-of-the-art works by 77.8% in accuracy, 37.1% in delay, 21.5% in area, 50.6% in area delay product (ADP), and 25.9% in power consumption. Compared to the fixed-point division baseline, CBDIV also achieves a 31.9% reduction in energy consumption and is more energy efficient than existing SC-based dividers for binary inputs and outputs required in efficient image processing implementations. Moreover, we demonstrate that FSCDIV improves delay by 56.4%, ADP by 16.0%, energy consumption by 45.0%, and accuracy by 61.2%. We also evaluate CBDIV and FSCDIV designs in a contrast stretch image processing workload, and the results show that the proposed designs can improve the image quality by up to 18.3 dB on average when compared to state-of-the-art works.</description></item><item><title>ReApprox-PIM: Reconfigurable Approximate Lookup-Table (LUT)-Based Processing-in-Memory (PIM) Machine Learning Accelerator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443597</link><description>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success in various applications. Numerous hardware accelerators are introduced to accelerate CNN execution with improved energy efficiency compared to traditional software implementations. Despite the achieved success, deploying traditional hardware accelerators for bulky CNNs on current and emerging smart devices is impeded by limited resources, including memory, power, area, and computational capabilities. Recent works introduced processing-in-memory (PIM), a non-Von-Neumann architecture, which is a promising approach to tackle the problem of data movement between logic and memory blocks. However, as observed from the literature, the existing PIM architectures cannot congregate all the computational operations due to limited programmability and flexibility. Furthermore, the capabilities of the PIM are challenged by the limited available on-chip memory. To enable faster computations and address the limited on-chip memory constraints, this work introduces a novel reconfigurable approximate computing (AC)-based PIM, termed reconfigurable approximate PIM (ReApprox-PIM). The proposed ReApprox-PIM is capable of addressing the two challenges mentioned above in the following manner: 1) it utilizes a programmable lookup-table (LUT)-based processing architecture that can support different AC techniques via programmability and 2) followed by resource-efficient, fast CNN computing via the implementation of highly optimized AC techniques. This results in improved computing footprint, operational parallelism, and reduced computational latency and power consumption compared to prior PIMs relying on exact computations for CNN inference acceleration at a minimal sacrifice of accuracy. We have evaluated the proposed ReApprox-PIM on various CNN architectures, for inference applications, including standard LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet-18, &#8722;34, and &#8722;50. Our experimental results show that the ReApprox-PIM achieves a speedup of  $1.63\times $  with  $1.66\times $  lower area for the processing components compared to the existing PIM architectures. Furthermore, the proposed ReApprox-PIM achieves  $2.5\times $  higher energy efficiency and  $1.3\times $  higher throughput compared to the state-of-the-art LUT-based PIM architectures.</description></item><item><title>Inter-Task Energy-Hotspot Elimination in Fixed-Priority Real-Time Embedded Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10457858</link><description>Multitask real-time embedded systems are often restricted by tight energy budgets, whilst they usually have environmental interactions through software-controlled energy-hungry peripheral modules, such as LTE, WiFi, and GSM. The way that the driver calls are used within the embedded software to do such a control introduces program energy-hotspots (EHs) from the peripheral module perspective, namely, the code pieces wasting the system energy. By the energy waste, we mean that the energy consumption is reducible via some program code modifications without threatening the system schedulability and logical correctness. This article examines the program EHs of fixed-priority real-time tasks where two types of energy inefficiency can occur: 1) intra-task type, causing energy waste even if a task runs individually and 2) inter-task type, happening due to the interaction between different system tasks, namely, preemption scenarios even if there is no intra-task EH. The main cause of such EHs is the unnecessary time intervals between the driver calls, causing extra energy consumption by peripheral modules. We propose some static analysis methods to automatically detect and eliminate both types of intra- and inter-task EHs regarding their mutual relevance, according to the extreme (worst-case and best-case) execution times of certain task code parts. Our manipulations on the tasks to eliminate the EHs include some program code modifications with the awareness of system schedulability and logical correctness, and changing some scheduling decisions, namely, limiting the preemption points. After applying our proposed method to the test tasks, our simulation results show an energy reduction of up to 19%.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Power Variation-Tolerant 7T SRAM With Enhanced Read Sensing Margin for Voltage Scaling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10439970</link><description>Reducing the minimum operating voltage  $(V_{\mathrm {min}})$  and improving the variation tolerance are the main design challenges of voltage-scalable static random access memories (SRAMs). This article presents a variation-tolerant 7T SRAM with reduced data-dependent read bitline (RBL) leakage to enhance read sensing margin and improve  $V_{\mathrm {min}}$  without any assist techniques. The design implements a delay-tracking-based adaptive timing generation technique and an error detection circuit for process, voltage and temperature variation-tolerant operation and reliable dynamic voltage scaling. An 8-kb SRAM macro is implemented in 55-nm CMOS technology to demonstrate our design.

Though several schemes have been developed over the years, unfortunately, they suffer from time-consumption, power-consumption, and resource-bound tradeoff issues. Another major issue concerns designing efficient architecture to perform the alignment of multiple sequences. A novel hierarchical multiprocessing architecture, designed around pipelined processing elements, is presented for multiple pairwise sequence alignment at hardware-speed. In addition to parallel intrasequence trace-back value generation, it can efficiently perform parallel intersequence computation to attain maximum utilization of processing elements. It can accomplish parallel trace-back operations to achieve massive parallelism. It consumes  ${O({ni})}$  or  ${O({ji})}$  clock-cycles to perform alignment operations for  $j$ -nucleotide query and  $i$  reference sequences of  $n$ -nucleotide, instead of  ${O({(n+j)i})}$  or  ${O({nji})}$  clock-cycles used in state-of-the-art architectures. The entire architecture is evaluated for 16-to-512 multiple sequences of 16-to-512 nucleotides. It achieves  $\approx 1.6$  to  $\approx 24~\mathrm {GCUPS}$  (GCUPS: Giga cell updates per second) throughput and  $\approx 5$  to  $\approx 12.5~{\mathrm{ GCUPS/W}}$  power-efficiency for 16-to-64 sequences and  $\approx 1.6$  to  $\approx 5.6~{\mathrm{ GCUPS/W}}$  for 128-to-512 sequences. The peak throughput for 1024-nucleotide sequence is 128 GCUPS, and power-efficiency is  $41~{\mathrm{ GCUPS/W}}$ . Finally, the presented architecture exhibits a gain of  $\approx 2\times $  in throughput and  $\approx 6\times $  in power-efficiency compared to state-of-the-art architectures.</description></item><item><title>On-Device Continual Learning With STT-Assisted-SOT MRAM-Based In-Memory Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10453336</link><description>Due to the separate memory and computation units in traditional von Neumann architecture, massive data transfer dominates the overall computing system&#8217;s power and latency, known as the &#8220;Memory-Wall&#8221; issue. Especially with ever-increasing deep learning-based AI model size and computing complexity, it becomes the bottleneck for state-of-the-art AI computing systems. To address this challenge, in-memory computing (IMC)-based Neural Network accelerators have been widely investigated to support AI computing within memory. However, most of those works focus only on inference. The on-device training and continual learning have not been well explored yet. In this work, for the first time, we introduce on-device continual learning with STT-assisted-SOT (SAS) magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM)-based IMC system. On the hardware side, we have fabricated a STT-assisted-SOT MRAM (SAS-MRAM) device prototype with 4 magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs, each at 100 nm  $\times50$  nm) sharing a common heavy metal layer, achieving significantly improved memory writing and area efficiency compared to traditional SOT-MRAM. Next, we designed fully digital IMC circuits with our SAS-MRAM to support both neural network inference and on-device learning. To enable efficient on-device continual learning for new task data, we present an 8-bit integer (INT8)-based continual learning algorithm that utilizes our SAS-MRAM IMC-supported bit-serial digital in-memory convolution operations to train a small parallel reprogramming network (Rep-Net) while freezing the major backbone model. Extensive studies have been presented based on our fabricated SAS-MRAM device prototype, cross-layer device-circuit benchmarking and simulation, as well as the on-device continual learning system evaluation.</description></item><item><title>APIM: An Antiferromagnetic MRAM-Based Processing-In-Memory System for Efficient Bit-Level Operations of Quantized Convolutional Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10457534</link><description>Quantized convolutional neural network (QCNN) is an attractive approach that reduces hardware overheads, especially for energy-constrained systems. However, existing QCNNs still require nontrivial hardware resources and memory capacity in order not to compromise model accuracy. To address this issue, we propose an antiferromagnetic magnetic random-access memory (ARAM)-based processing-in-memory (PIM) system, leveraging bit-level sparsity. Three optimization techniques are proposed to optimize hardware resource utilization while preserving CNN accuracy. First, the ARAM-based memory subsystem allows dynamic adaptation of variable bit-width across CNN layers. Second, the bit-level accelerator employs the bit-fusion format engineered for processing data from the ARAM subsystem. Third, a customized data path within the RISC-V core guarantees efficient instruction processing to the ARAM-based memory subsystem and bit-level accelerator, enabling optimal bit-level data transmission and computation. Experimental results demonstrate that this design remarkably reduces data movement by 50%&#8211;83% across existing CNNs. Compared to state-of-the-art designs, it enhances throughput and latency by an average of  $5\times $  and  $10\times $ , respectively. In addition, this design achieves speedups between  $1.63\times $  and  $2.96\times $ , outstripping other designs in AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet18 benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Design of Sequential Load Modulation Balance Amplifier Using Multiobjective Particle Swarm Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443236</link><description>In this article, a multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MPSO) method is presented for the design of a sequential load modulation balanced amplifier (SLMBA).

However, NVM devices are prone to device variations. Consequently, the actual DNN weights mapped to NVM devices can differ considerably from their targeted values, inducing significant performance degradation. Many existing solutions aim to optimize average performance amidst device variations, which is a suitable strategy for general-purpose conditions. However, the worst-case performance that is crucial for safety-critical applications is largely overlooked in current research. In this study, we define the problem of pinpointing the worst-case performance of CiM DNN accelerators affected by device variations. Additionally, we introduce a strategy to identify a specific pattern of the device value deviations in the complex, high-dimensional value deviation space, responsible for this worst-case outcome. Our findings reveal that even subtle device variations can precipitate a dramatic decline in DNN accuracy, posing risks for CiM-based platforms in supporting safety-critical applications. Notably, we observe that prevailing techniques to bolster average DNN performance in CiM accelerators fall short in enhancing worst-case scenarios. In light of this issue, we propose a novel worst-case-aware training technique named A-TRICE that efficiently combines adversarial training and noise-injection training with right-censored Gaussian noise to improve the DNN accuracy in the worst-case scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate that A-TRICE improves the worst-case accuracy under device variations by up to 33%.</description></item><item><title>Cross-Domain Optimization of Low-Power Mixed-Signal Sensor Systems Under Classification Accuracy Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10457029</link><description>Optimizing mixed-signal systems-on-chips (SoCs) is a challenging task, especially when they involve both analog building blocks and machine-learning (ML) algorithms which make the overall system performance hard to predict. This article proposes a methodology for optimizing complex mixed-signal sensor systems, which consists of three steps: 1) modeling Pareto-optimal local performance of individual circuits; 2) building a macromodel of the mixed-signal system performance, including local nonidealities; and 3) finding the optimal set of system-level parameters using numerical optimization. The methodology is applied to the use case of an electrocardiogram (ECG) sensor system with embedded arrhythmia classification, with the objective of minimizing the system power consumption while imposing constraints on inference accuracy. Different numerical optimization methods are compared to evaluate their respective performance on the minimization task: gradient-based, genetic, or Bayesian optimization. The proposed methodology achieves the optimization in a reasonable execution time of 10 h, which had not been previously demonstrated on such complex mixed-signal system. Among the different methods tested, Bayesian optimization provides the best-success rate of 97% and fastest convergence speed.</description></item><item><title>Accelerating Real-Valued FFT on CPU-FPGA Platforms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472631</link><description>The real-valued fast Fourier transform (RFFT) is an ideal candidate for implementing a high-speed and low-power FFT processor because it only has approximately half the number of arithmetic operations compared with traditional complex-valued FFT (CFFT). Although RFFT can be calculated using CFFT hardware, a dedicated RFFT implementation can result in reduced hardware complexity, power consumption and increased throughput. However, unlike CFFT, RFFT has irregular signal flow graphs which hinders the design of efficient pipelined architectures. In this article, utilizing open computing language (OpenCL), we propose a high-level programming method for the implementation of pipelined architectures of RFFT on FPGAs. By identifying the regular computational pattern in the flow graph of RFFT, the proposed method essentially uses a for loop to implement the RFFT algorithm, and later with the help of high-level synthesis tools, the loop is fully unrolled to automatically build pipelined architectures. Experiments show that for a 4096-point RFFT, the proposed method achieves a  $2.49\times $  speedup and  $3.09\times $  better-energy efficiency over CUFFT on GPU, and a  $21.12\times $  speedup and  $16.09\times $  better-energy efficiency over FFTW on CPU, respectively. Compared to Intel&#8217;s CFFT design on the same FPGA, the proposed one reduces 12% logic resources and 16% DSP blocks, respectively, while achieving a  $1.48\times $  speedup.</description></item></channel></rss>
