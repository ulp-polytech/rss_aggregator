This article suggests a new spatial magnetic field configuration for transmitting coils in wireless power transfer systems to tackle these problems. The construction features a square base with a rhombus embedded inside it, along with four rectangular sides that are coiled in a noncrossing manner. This configuration ensures a consistent distribution of magnetic field in three dimensions. In order to guarantee that many UAVs are charged simultaneously without interfering with one another, the LCC-S topology is used to accomplish the characteristic of constant current at the main side and constant voltage at the output side. During UAV hovering, output dc&#8211;dc is combined with charge management to achieve hovering power supply and constant current charging with minimum size. The experimental results show that when the UAV hovers in the three-dimensional conical space volume above the WPT platform, it maintains a stable output power with an approximately constant 84.5% transmission efficiency.

Through the strategic adjustment of the input admittance, the conductance of the low-power diode decreases progressively with increasing power, while the conductance of the high-power diode increases correspondingly. This conductance-based power allocation method ensures that the power is rectified consistently by the most appropriate diode, regardless of the power level, and, thus, enables efficient rectification across an extended range. This letter presents a rectifier typology to substantiate the proposed strategy. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the adaptive power division strategy, with the rectifier showing efficiency in excess of 60% from 5 to 29.5 dBm, giving a power dynamic range of 24.5 dB.</description></item><item><title>Conditional Sixth-Harmonic Injection to Improve the Linear Modulation Range of Three-Phase Voltage-Source Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648706</link><description>Overmoduation techniques are used to improve dc bus voltage utilization for three-phase voltage-source converters (VSCs), resulting in significant reduction in fundamental voltage gain.

The goal is to provide a low-cost and easy-implemented impedance measurement technique that does not rely on actual disturbance sources or prior controller knowledge. In this method, only two-phase sampling channels are needed to measure positive- and negative-sequence impedances of GCC at the same time. This method works well with converters employing various control strategies, and its universality is proved by theoretical analysis.

This letter leverages the spread spectrum technique in a class E inverter-driven, highly resonant system to address these challenges. However, a conventional class E inverter would be optimized toward a single frequency, and directly leading to hard switching issue when applying spread spectrum. By examining original classical class-E design method, it enriches the understanding of the design under frequency modulation scenarios. Through simulation, it investigates the tradeoffs among various goals, including efficiency, voltage stress, output ripple, and EMI reduction. It develops an IPT system according to the design strategy, achieving zero-voltage switching across a frequency modulation range of 0.95&#8211;1.05 MHz and maintaining an efficiency of 87%. This approach resulted in a 13-dB EMI reduction compared to a 1 MHz classical class E design.</description></item><item><title>A Modulation Method With Current Zero-Crossing Distortion Elimination and Voltage Balance Control for the RSHMC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645288</link><description>Hybrid multilevel converters have gained more popularity due to their unique superiority. Thus, the reduced switch hybrid multilevel (RSHMC) converter is adopted in this article which consists three H-bridge cells and a Vienna rectifier. The RSHMC converter combines the advantages of these two topologies and can output higher voltage level by adopting fewer switching devices compared with other multilevel converters. However, the Vienna rectifier of the RSHMC converter has the inherent current zero-crossing distortion (CZCD) problem, which will increase the total harmonic distortion of the grid-side current. Thus, a modulation method based on phase disposition-pulsewidth modulation is proposed to eliminate the CZCD of the RSHMC converter by selecting redundant switching states. Besides, in order to ensure the normal operation of the RSHMC converter, the proposed modulation method can also realize the voltage balance control of the floating capacitor and the neutral point which is also realized by selecting the switching states to charge or discharge. Consequently, the RSHMC converter can operate normally with balanced voltage and without CZCD after adopting the proposed modulation method. Finally, the feasibility and correctness of the proposed modulation method are verified by simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Evaluation of Capacitor Voltage Balancing Control Strategies for Multilevel DAB Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666267</link><description>Dual active bridge converter with multilevel neutral point clamped topology has shown potential to be a viable solution for medium-voltage dc systems. However, it will face a crucial challenge with regard to capacitor voltage balancing. In order to mitigate the negative effects caused by the voltage imbalance, e.g., overvoltage on certain devices, various control strategies for voltage balancing have been developed. To better design and implement the voltage balancing strategies, this article evaluates several voltage balancing approaches, i.e., modified duty cycle (MDC) method, modified phase shift and duty cycle (MPSDC) method, fixed switching state (FSS) method, and complementary switching state (CSS) method. These voltage balancing approaches have distinct characteristics in terms of dynamics, efficiency, robustness, applicability with modulation strategy, and implementation complexity. Evaluation results show that the MDC and MPSDC methods have advantage of extending to various control strategies. However, they are affected by current polarity identification, and have large current and power fluctuations. The FSS method is the most robust and the simplest one, but it also has poor dynamics. On the other hand, the CSS method can deliver smooth dynamics and high efficiency, but it relies on identifying the polarity of inductor current, and it cannot be used to the single phase shift and triple phase shift control strategies. Based on the evaluation results, the suitable applications of different voltage balancing methods are discussed.</description></item><item><title>Forced Fluorinated Liquid Cooling for Medium Voltage SiC Power Modules: Concurrently Addressing Electrical and Thermal Challenges</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638826</link><description>Enhanced insulation and superior thermal characteristics are crucial in advanced packaging for medium voltage (MV) silicon carbide (SiC) power modules. Nonetheless, the reduction in thermal resistance typically compromises insulation level due to the decreased number of insulation layers. In this paper, the forced fluorinated liquid cooling is proposed, whereby fluorinated liquid (3M FC-40) is directed into the power module, substituting silicone gel and diminishing thermal resistance. Through the utilization of forced fluorinated liquid cooling, a reduction of 21&#176;C in junction temperature at full load is demonstrated in the experiment, compared to traditional water cooled power modules. Furthermore, there is a 35.6% reduction observed in the maximum temperature rise &#916;Tj. As dissipation power is transferred from the topside of the chip to the fluorinated liquid, the possibility of unlimited stacking of direct bonded copper (DBC) is enabled to lower the electrical field, thereby facilitating insulation at the chip bottom side without any worries regarding heightened thermal resistance. Forced fluorinated liquid cooling resulted in a 39&#176;C reduction in the double-stacked DBC power module. Moreover, partial discharge (PD) detection under square wave revealed that the DBC immersed in the fluorinated liquid remains free from PD at 10 kV, a significantly higher threshold than observed with silicone gel. A higher partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) is anticipated for double-stacked DBC when immersed in 3M FC-40. Thus, the forced fluorinated liquid cooling can be considered a promising solution for the next generation of MV SiC power modules.</description></item><item><title>A High Accuracy and Low-Cost Fatigue Life Evaluation Method for IGBTs Based on Variable-Parameter Power Cycling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648866</link><description>Fatigue life of insulated gate bipolar transistor modules (IGBTs) is critical to the reliable application during their long-term servicing. At present, time-consuming and costly power cycling tests are commonly used to obtain the fatigue life model of power electronics devices. In this article, a lower cost and higher efficiency method for the evaluation on the fatigue life of IGBTs was proposed based on variable-parameter power cycling. First, theoretical feasibility of the proposed method was discussed based on fatigue theory. Then, details concerning on the proposed method were described combining with the power cycling data obtained from electro-thermal coupling simulations. Finally, power cycling under both constant and variable parameter was carried out to IGBT modules for experimental verifications. Results dedicate that the fitted fatigue life deduced from the degradation curve of electro-thermal characteristics of IGBTs under variable-parameter power cycling was well consistent with that directly measured from constant-parameter power cycling. It results in an order of magnitude increase in test efficiency and an order of magnitude decrease in costs, which brings huge economic benefit and high efficiency to the fatigue life evaluation of IGBTs.</description></item><item><title>An Alternative Junction-to-Case Thermal Resistance Test Method for High Power Press-Pack IGBTs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660505</link><description>Press-pack insulated gate bipolar transistors (PP IGBTs) is well suited for high-voltage, high-power applications due to their double-side cooling, ease of series connection, and higher power density. It is very important to measure the junction-to-case thermal resistance (Rthjc) for evaluating thermal performance, with high accuracy. However, the existing thermal resistance test methods will have the problem of low accuracy when it is used in PP IGBTs. In this article, a new thermal resistance test method is proposed based on the transient dual-interface method (TDIM), different from traditional TDIM, which can obtain two transient thermal impedance (Zth) curves without disassembling the fixture, and determine the Rthjc through the separation point. The 4500 V 3000 A StakPak PP IGBTs is used as the measurement object. The results show that compared with the traditional TDIM, the new method is very simple to operate, and the test results are more accurate than thermocouples, which is more suitable for PP IGBTs. The single-side thermal resistance of the PP IGBTs is analyzed, and the emitter side is even worse due to the disc spring. The Rthjc calculated by single-side thermal resistance is close to the proposed method, but fluctuates widely.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated PWM-Based Active Thermal Control for Power Semiconductor Devices in Parallel Grid-Tied Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10663216</link><description>This article proposes a new active thermal control method for power semiconductor devices in parallel grid-tied inverters using coordinated pulsewidth modulation (PWM), which breaks the limitation that the PWM-based active thermal control cannot reduce the switching frequency below rated value, and therefore provides more regulation freedom to improve the reliability of power semiconductor devices. In specific, both frequency and phase shift values of PWM sequences will be adjusted coordinately to relieve the junction temperature of parallel inverters while keeping the total high-frequency harmonics at point of common coupling (PCC) to meet the quality requirement. The presented method is applicable to parallel inverters with identical or different input power. Finally, experimental results verified the performance of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Optimization and Validation of Current Sharing in IGBT Modules With Multichips in Parallel</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665971</link><description>Multichips paralleled insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) power modules are widely employed in industrial and automotive power conversion systems. The asymmetry of the circuit topology and the differences in chip characteristics are the main reasons for the unbalanced current distribution among parallel chips, leading to excessive electrical stress in power modules, which in turn forces the power modules to operate at a reduced rated current. Additionally, the unbalanced current distribution inevitably results in different chip losses, which are further amplified under high current loading conditions, causing some chips to be overheated, and significantly reducing the reliability. Optimizing the circuit topology is a common method to improve current distribution, but global changes often entail higher costs and longer development cycles. Moreover, the electrical parasitic of the fast recovery diodes (FRD) chip branches are not given sufficient attention in circuit topology research. Under rectification and blocked conditions in electric vehicles, FRDs often become the bottleneck for lifespan due to excessively high junction temperatures. Therefore, this article conducts a comparative analysis of the circuit parasitic in IGBT and FRD loops with several typical layouts, without changing the substrate and chip dimensions, and proposes a current sharing slot structure design to balance the parasitic parameters. Compared with the direct bonded copper (DBC) layout of the typical EconoDUAL power module, the optimized module reduces the current imbalance of FRD from 45.5% to 11.6% and the switching loss can be reduced by 8.6%. By adopting the current sharing groove, the parasitic parameter distribution can be further improved while maintaining a fixed DBC layout, considering the IGBT and FRD branches in concert. Finally, the steady-state and transient current sharing characteristics were verified under constant current and inverter conditions. Under constant current conditions, the temperature difference of FRD in the upper and lower parallel layout modules was reduced by 16.7&#8201;&#176;C, and the junction temperature of IGBT was significantly lowered. Under inverter conditions, the highest junction temperature of the columnar layout modules could be reduced by 10&#8201;&#176;C, and the temperature difference of FRD decreased by 62%. This article significantly optimizes the current imbalance issue through layout design, reduces the thermal equilibrium difference of the module under application conditions, and is conducive to improving the output capacity and fatigue life of the module, providing a solution for the design of power modules with high junction temperature operation capability and high-reliability.</description></item><item><title>Evaluation and MHz Converter Application of 1.2-kV Vertical GaN JFET</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638831</link><description>The 1.2 kV vertical GaN fin-channel junction field-effect transistor (JFET) is an emerging industrial device with low specific on-resistance (RON), normally-off operation, and avalanche capability. This article reports the first comprehensive evaluation of 1.2 kV, 75 m&#937; gallium nitride (GaN) JFET in converter applications. The RC-interface gate driver is optimized through the double-pulse test (DPT). To quantify the device's conduction loss, an in-situ measurement of dynamic RON is performed in a continuous DPT at steady-state. The vertical GaN JFET shows no dynamic RON issue. Subsequently, a GaN JFET-based half bridge is evaluated in a zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) buck converter under various frequencies, duty cycles, and load conditions. For comparison, similarly-rated SiC mosfet and Si IGBT are tested in the same converter. Benefitting from the lowest output capacitance and output charge, the GaN JFET requires a short deadtime and enables MHz operation in the 800-V ZVS buck converter. The GaN converter achieves a maximum efficiency of 97.7% at 1 MHz and 98.0% at 500 kHz and shows a general advantage in frequency and efficiency compared to the same converters based on SiC mosfet and Si IGBT. In addition, under the operational driver condition, the 1.2 kV GaN JFET shows a long short-circuit withstanding time of over 40 &#956;s at 800 V. These results provide key reference for the application of 1.2 kV GaN JFETs and suggest that a GaN device with proper designs can achieve excellent stability and robustness.</description></item><item><title>Miniaturized Current Shunt With High Bandwidth and Low Parasitics for High-Integrated Applications: Electro-Thermal Considerations and Co-Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638787</link><description>The development of current sensors for wide-bandgap (WBG) applications consistently emphasizes high bandwidth, minimal invasiveness, and integration. Despite the meticulous design that enables current shunts to achieve excellent performance with high bandwidth and low parasitics, their inherent bulkiness remains a significant challenge for their integration into high-integrated applications that depend on the high switching speeds of WBG power devices. This study thoroughly investigates and uncovers the tradeoff faced by traditional current shunts in balancing miniaturization and high bandwidth. Building upon this understanding, the miniaturized current shunt (MiniShunt) concept is introduced to overcome inherent limitations and achieve both high performance and compact size. To realize this concept, a physical implementation that involves the high-density stacking of multiple coupled transmission lines is presented. Additionally, a thermal network model specifically for the proposed MiniShunt configuration is developed and a comprehensive thermal analysis methodology for the current shunts is established. By applying this methodology to finite element analysis, the thermal safe operating area for the MiniShunt can be determined, further providing valuable insights into its maximum static power dissipation and maximum energy loss. These findings contribute to the development of a highly compact 9 &#215; 9-mm, 100-m&#937; current shunt with an ultrahigh bandwidth of 3 GHz, near-zero parasitic inductance, and a maximum energy loss of 2.0 J at a reference temperature rise limit of 20 &#176;C. Extensive experiments conducted in both the frequency and time domains serve to further validate the advantages of the MiniShunt in terms of its miniaturization, integration, ultrafast response, and low invasiveness for future high-integrated power electronics applications.</description></item><item><title>Insulation Capability at 10 kV, &gt;300 V/ns of a Nonlinear Resistive Polymer Nanocomposite Field-Grading Coating in a 15-kV Silicon Carbide Module</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648830</link><description>Emerging medium-voltage silicon carbide devices offer the potential to achieve more efficient and compact power electronics for grid-tied applications. However, the lack of an effective insulation solution for packaging the devices has slowed their widespread adoption. Recently, a nonlinear resistive polymer nanocomposite coating has been introduced to enhance the insulation by reducing localized electric field stress inside the modules. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the insulation capability of the polymer nanocomposite under high dv/dt. Half-bridge modules of 15-kV silicon carbide devices were packaged with the nanocomposite coating at the triple points on the module substrate. All the modules were tested free of partial discharge at 20 kV for 1 min. One module underwent a repetitive double-pulse test at 10 kV, 2 A and was switching at a peak dv/dt &gt; 300 V/ns. These findings further support the coating's potential as a viable practical solution to the insulation challenge of medium-voltage power modules.</description></item><item><title>Droop Control of Three- and Four-Leg Hybrid Parallel Inverters Based on Three-Phase Generalized Coordinate Transformation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637483</link><description>In recent years, widespread adoption of three-leg inverters has been observed. However, there is often a need for three-phase four-wire inverters to provide a neutral connection for asymmetrical loads within microgrid contexts. This article proposes a three- and four-leg hybrid inverter parallel structure to address the above issues. The aim is to fulfill the four-wire requirement under asymmetrical load conditions and mitigate the voltage unbalance problem. The article begins by investigating the output voltage balance control of three- and four-leg inverters and the control techniques of the hybrid parallel system. Deficiencies in traditional power droop control and virtual impedance control under unbalanced conditions are identified by calculating the inverter's output power under asymmetric load conditions. To address these issues, the article adopts average power droop and proposes a novel virtual impedance method. This method considers the impact of line impedance differences on the distribution accuracy of active power and unbalanced load current, effectively improving their distribution accuracy. Connecting three- and four-leg inverters in parallel, the four-leg inverter is capable of significantly reducing the zero-sequence voltage of the common load terminal and enhances three-phase voltage balance. Finally, experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the improved virtual impedance control.</description></item><item><title>An Additional Damping Torque Method for Low-Frequency Stability Enhancement of Virtual Synchronous Generators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638828</link><description>Low-frequency oscillations may occur in a virtual synchronous generator (VSG), resulting from an insufficient equivalent damping ration, which may be a serious stability issue for VSG. Thus, an additional damping ration is expected to be provided without affecting droop behaviors and the inertia response of VSG. To that end, an analytical approach based on combining a damping torque model and a small-signal model is developed to investigate the damping behaviors of the VSG. The relationship between the two models is brought to light, indicating that the damping torque model is suitable for qualitative analysis to give the contribution of different feedback loops to the system damping level. Subsequently, the latter is adopted for quantitative analysis to illustrate the damping ration of the system. Furthermore, an additional damping torque method is proposed, which can provide an extra damping ration for the system by increasing the equivalent positive damping torque and guaranteeing that the original droop characteristics and inertia are not compromised. Besides, the proposed control method is implemented by inserting an auxiliary branch into the power control loops of VSG. Experimental results verify the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed additional damping method.</description></item><item><title>Exact Linearization Control of a Two-Stage DC&#8211;AC Converter With a Power Pulsating Buffer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638817</link><description>This article proposes to combine full feedback linearization with full state feedback and trajectory tracking control in order to obtain a high performance dc&#8211;ac boost converter. The system is composed of a boost converter, an inverter, and a power pulsation buffer, which removes the ripple from the dc-link, and allows reducing the size of its capacitor. This can improve the reliability of the system, as smaller capacitors do not need to be electrolytic. The use of full feedback linearization enables a stable controller at any point of operation, while the trajectory tracking control allows high performance tracking of the references (required for smaller capacitor values). The steady state performance and disturbance rejection capabilities are provided by the full state feedback control. In addition, the effect of parametric mismatches is analyzed, and the robustness of the proposal is validated through simulations and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>A Nonlinear Hybrid Impedance Matching Technique for Electromagnetic Exploration Transmitter With 96% Multifrequency Signal Energy Utilization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10640305</link><description>In electromagnetic exploration applications, the grounded cable and transmitting coil transducers are typical inductive loads that can cause reactive power occupation problems to power converters and limit the effective utilization of transmission signal energy. However, the existing impedance matching techniques show poor compatibility with nonlinear square voltage signals, which use multiple harmonic components to efficiently acquire geological information of multiple depths. To address these issues, a novel nonlinear hybrid impedance matching (NHIM) technique that combines a passive thyristor-controlled capacitor (TCC) and active insulated-gate bipolar transistor-controlled converter (ICC) is proposed to provide multifrequency impedance matching simultaneously under varying frequency conditions. In this article, the nonlinear matching strategy is first introduced. Then, the NHIM parameter optimal design is proposed considering the reduction of dc supply voltage requirement. After that, a cooperative control strategy is proposed, including multifrequency power calculation, impedance identification, and control reference calculation for TCC and ICC to constitute fundamental and high-frequency reactive power compensation. Finally, comparative simulations and experiments verify the cooperative design methodology of the proposed NHIM. Compared with the existing broadband matching, the proposed method ensures 12%&#8211;460% spectral amplitude enhancement and over 96% multifrequency signal energy utilization, which is a 10%&#8211;13% performance improvement over previous techniques.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Control for Smooth Power Direction Transition of Bidirectional Resonant CLLC Converter With Wide Voltage Gain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645296</link><description>The resonant CLLC circuit has become a mainstream choice for isolated bidirectional dc&#8211;dc converters due to its high efficiency. However, the power is inversely related to the switching frequency, resulting in a power control blind area under conditions of low gain and light load. This blind area can induce voltage oscillations during power direction transitions, potentially affecting the connected circuits and the grid. Incorporating phase-shift control can eliminate the blind area, but it also reduces efficiency. Consequently, the operational scope of phase-shift control should be minimized as much as possible. Meanwhile, the switching devices driven by frequency control differ between forward and backward modes. As an intermediate state, phase-shift control must ensure smooth transitions of the drive signal of primary and secondary sides. To address these challenges, this article analyzed the boundaries of the blind area at different gains and calculated the relationship between power and the phase-shift angle. Furthermore, it analyzed the coupling variations of frequency and phase-shift angle and achieved smooth transitions in frequency and phase-shift angle during the transition based on digital synchronous rectification control. Finally, a unified control scheme was established and verified through experiments to achieve overall high efficiency and smooth bidirectional transitions.</description></item><item><title>A Non-Resonant ZVS Four-Switch Flyback Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645305</link><description>The four-switch flyback (FSF) converter has the advantages of low switch voltage stress and zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) with the leakage inductance energy. However, if the clamping capacitor is too small, its voltage will oscillate, and the negative magnetizing current for realizing ZVS is difficult to be accurately obtained since it is generated by resonance. In this article, the clamping capacitor is intentionally designed quite large so that its voltage keeps nearly constant. The resultant converter is called nonresonant ZVS FSF converter. The operating principle of the converter is analyzed, and the method to accurately control the negative magnetizing current is proposed, which not only minimizes the magnetizing current ripple, but also realizes ZVS for all the power switches. Finally, a 400-W prototype is built and tested in the lab, and experimental results are provided to verify the operating principle of the FSF converter and the proposed control method.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Intelligent Control Using Hippocampus-Based Fuzzy Neural Networks for Active Power Filter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645310</link><description>To tackle harmonic issue in the power grid, an intelligent control scheme consists of fast integral terminal sliding-mode control and hippocampus-based fuzzy neural network (HBFNN) is proposed and applied to active power filter (APF) to eliminate harmonics in this article.

Afterwards, a fast integral terminal sliding-mode controller is developed for APF. The system stability is subsequently proved according to Lyapunov stability criterion, and the finite-time convergence of tracking error is certified. In addition, based on the biological structure and characteristics of the hippocampus, an innovative HBFNN is constructed to approximate the controller. Furthermore, the adaptive laws derived by the Lyapunov's theorem can realize the automatic adjustment of parameters and ensure closed-loop stability. Ultimately, relevant simulation and experimental results corroborate the availability and superiority of the designed intelligent control strategy in harmonic elimination.</description></item><item><title>Active Power Decoupling Control for Three-Level Buck Four-Leg Current Source Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10652896</link><description>Significant pulsating power exists on the dc side of three-phase four-wire inverters in the case of unbalanced or nonlinear loads, which will degrade the power quality of the dc side voltage.

These unique characteristics introduce challenges to the impedance matching of ULF electroacoustic transducer. In other words, advanced impedance matching strategies to simultaneously maintain high transmission efficiency and broadband acoustic radiation are untapped. To address these issues, a controllable T-type broadband impedance matching network (CTIMN) is proposed here. First, the matching principle of CTIMN is newly developed by deriving two equivalent circuits from both the output of power amplifier and the input of ULF electroacoustic transducer. Then, the parameter design method based on the exhaustive method is proposed to yield the optimal parametric design for CTIMN. Combined with the adaptive proportional-resonant control strategy, the operating principle of CTIMN is illustrated.

However, there exists a tradeoff between disturbance rejection and noise immunity for traditional linear ESO (TLESO). Compared to TLESO with similar bandwidth, phase-locking loop observer (PLLO) exhibits a better output tracking performance but weaker noise suppression capability. By combining the advantages of TLESO and PLLO, an adaptive LESO (ALESO) is proposed in this article, which utilizes TLESO in steady state and PLLO during transient state. The dynamic and noise-suppression performances of different observers are analyzed and compared systematically. The proposed ALESO inherits good dynamic response of PLLO and noise-suppression performance of TLESO, without using high bandwidth. It also possesses the advantages of simple structure, requiring few tuning parameters and ease of parameter tuning. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ALESO design, it is employed to a 500 W dual-active-bridge dc&#8211;dc converter for pulsed power applications. Experiments results show that, in comparison with TLESO, the proposed ALESO has resulted in 33.3%/37% and 60%/73.3% reductions in output voltage undershoot/overshoot and setting time, respectively, under load step-up/down.

However, the nonidentical high-frequency link (HFL) inductor is unavoidable, causing mutual interferences among submodules, and deteriorating the decoupling and voltage balance performances of conventional IVS strategies. Thus, a general decoupling IVS control strategy is proposed for ISOP DAB converter with nonidentical HFL inductors. First, an improved small-signal state-space model of ISOP DAB converter with a full-rank matrix is proposed to present the coupled performance of the ISOP DAB converter with nonidentical HFL inductors. Based on the improved model, a general decoupling method is proposed by invertible and gain-regulated matrices to achieve a diagonal matrix with uniform diagonal elements in the small-signal model, revealing and solving the sneak coupled performances among control loops. Next, a decoupling IVS control strategy is proposed by shaping full-order input impedance to solve the issues and coupled effects of multiple modes in the operation submodules. Then, the IVS controller is designed and detailed in the frequency and time domains, achieving input voltage balance and avoiding oscillation among submodules with better dynamics and more stable responsiveness. Moreover, the better characteristics of input impedance, output impedance, and input voltages in the proposed decoupling IVS control strategy are discussed and compared with traditional strategies. Finally, experiments are set up to verify the proposed general decoupling IVS control strategy for ISOP DAB converter with nonidentical HFL inductors.</description></item><item><title>Design and Validation of a Multioutput Wireless Power Transfer System Using MPC Controller</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10706646</link><description>This article presents a novel approach that combines Kalman filtering and model predictive control (MPC) algorithms to achieve stable output in a multioutput wireless power transfer (WPT) system for automated guided vehicles (AGVs).

However, existing temperature evaluation methods cannot accurately evaluate the temperature distribution of chips under surge conditions. This article proposes an experimental-simulation iterative modeling method, which is based on the electro-thermal coupling finite element model to simulate and calculate the temperature distribution of diode chips under surge conditions. The simulated I-V trajectory and temperature distribution are in good agreement with the experimental results. In addition, by monitoring the degradation of electrical characteristic parameters of diode chips under surge conditions and analyzing the scanning electron microscope results of failed chips, it was concluded that the single surge limit of the chip can be determined by the occurrence of aluminum electromigration phenomenon, and the critical conditions for the chip to reach the surge limit were quantitatively determined with the assistance of simulation results. Finally, based on the proposed temperature evaluation method, the relationship between the number of chip bonding wires and the surge limit was obtained.</description></item><item><title>A Compact, Single Stage, &gt;1 kV Medium-Voltage Line Impedance Stabilization Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643328</link><description>This article presents the design of a single-phase, single-stage line impedance stabilization network (LISN) for medium-voltage (MV) applications. More than 1 kV rated wide-bandgap (WBG) power semiconductor switches are increasingly utilized in new, emerging power electronics energy systems to improve power density and efficiency. However, due to inherently fast-switching speeds, WBG switch modules emit considerable electromagnetic interference (EMI) (e.g., common mode or differential mode). State-of-the-art offers standardized LISN solutions to validate and certify the new energy system for electromagnetic compatibility. However, most are for low voltage applications (i.e., &lt; 1 kV). MV LISNs (i.e., &gt; 1 kV) are rare until recently and literature does not provide sufficient guidelines for designing and characterizing such devices. It has been a critical challenge for many scientists and engineers to reliably certify the emerging MV energy systems (e.g., electric ships and aircraft). This article addresses such a technology gap. Specifically, a CISPR 16-1-2 compliant 50 &#937;/50 &#181;H LISN with 1.5 kV, 75 A and 30 MHz measurement capability has been proposed. Detailed performance study versus non-linear parasitic parameters variations in MV inductors and capacitors have been done. Based on new understandings, novel techniques to intuitively mitigate unwanted parasitic have been proposed to develop the proposed LISN successfully. Thorough characterization of important LISN parameters are presented and factors influencing them are analyzed. A rigorous analysis, experimental tests, and in-depth comparisons over state-of-the-art have been made to validate the effectiveness. This is done through the state-of-the-art 300 kVA MV EMI testbed.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Analysis of a Novel Distributed Magnetic-Pole Permanent Magnet Planetary Machine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531764</link><description>A novel distributed magnetic pole permanent magnet planetary machine (DMPPMPM) is proposed in this article, which has the advantages of high power density, high integration, reliable transmission, and simple controllability.

In view of the drag reduction requirements of micro vehicles, a piezoelectric traveling wave drag reducer (PTWDR) is proposed in this article. The PTWDR can be embedded into the surface of micro vehicles, with the merits of small size, high drag reduction efficiency and low energy consumption. We analyzed the structural changes of turbulent flow field caused by the actuation of PTWDR, and revealed the turbulent drag reduction mechanism. The control parameters selecting method to achieve required drag reduction performance under different operating conditions are proposed. The good drag reduction effects in various regions of the vehicles can be achieved by reasonably arranging PTWDR. The friction drag and total drag experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of PTWDR in achieving drag reduction, and the maximum drag reduction rate can reach 58%. Finally, the energy saving efficiency of PTWDR are studied, and it is confirmed that PTWDR can achieve net energy savings. This study provides an important reference for on-demand active drag reduction and net energy saving of micro vehicles.</description></item><item><title>Robust Control System Tuner and Cascaded Adaptive Vectorial Filter-Based PV-Battery System With a Dual-Loop ANF-PLL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10528786</link><description>This article presents a three-phase, single-stage photovoltaic (PV) system with a battery energy storage (BES) that functions in both grid-tied and islanded modes.

A parameter-switching methodology with the selected scheduling parameter is provided and the visual analyses of performance guarantees are analyzed. MADRC-gs is applied to a practical denitrification process of an in-service 660MW power plant. Actual operational data illustrate that MADRC-gs can reduce hourly average integral absolute error by about 22.61% and 43.18% in high-load and low-load ranges, respectively. Even though the power plant experiences lifting and lowering powers frequently, MADRC-gs can still obtain better control performance compared to the original controller and MADRC, and show a promising application potential in energy and chemical industries.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Round-Robin Protocol-Based Secondary Control for ESSs Under FDI Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538177</link><description>This article focuses on the distributed secondary control problem for energy storage systems (ESSs) under false data injection (FDI) attacks. To solve the problem, a $\boldsymbol{k}$-step attack estimation method is first proposed to estimate the unknown attacks and the estimation error converges to zero as the number of estimation steps increases to infinity. Next, we design a Round-Robin (RR) communication protocol to alleviate the communication burden among ESSs. Based on the estimator state and the RR communication protocol, a distributed secondary security controller is proposed by introducing a time-varying gain for each ESS. Different from the existing secondary control results on ESSs, the developed result can achieve state of charge (SoC) balancing and proportional power-sharing with restricted communication under FDI attacks. It is shown that the SoC balancing and proportional power-sharing objectives can be achieved under the developed methods. Finally, a real-time experiment is introduced to show the effectiveness of the developed methods.</description></item><item><title>Self-Adjusting Domain Adversarial Transfer Learning Algorithm for Power Transformer Lifetime Prediction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10546914</link><description>Accurate prediction of the remaining useful lifetime of power transformers plays a crucial role in effective operation and health maintenance of the entire power grid. Machine-learning based data-driven solution is effective on mitigating the high financial and time costs induced by traditional prediction schemes, however, this solution is limited by data distribution, data volume, data quality, and variations of prediction scenarios, making it difficult to achieve good prediction performance. To address this concern, a self-adjusting domain adversarial transfer learning (SDATL) algorithm for power transformer lifetime prediction is first proposed in this article. It extracts features from source and target domains by stacked convolution sparse auto-encoder (SCSAE), measures distributions of source and target domains by the adversarial domain adaptive module. Furthermore, it implements advantageous transfer learning after determining the transfer object. Moreover, the parametric linear rectification unit (PReLU) adaptive adjustment module is designed and constructed to further improve the prediction accuracy by optimizing the network structure through network transfer and iteration. The proposed SDATL network is evaluated by using condition monitoring data from six dry-type transformers and compared with existing prevalence data-driven algorithms. The evaluation and comparison results validate higher prediction accuracy and better adaptability of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Fractional-Order Gradient Neural Solution to Time-Variant Quadratic Programming With Application to Robot Motion Planning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10551266</link><description>This article proposes the fractional-order gradient neural network (FO-GNN) model for time-variant quadratic programming (TVQP) problems, marking the first integration of fractional calculus into neural solver design for cyclic motion planning in robotics. The FO-GNN evolves from traditional GNNs by employing fractional gradient operators, thus bypassing the differentiation typically required in zeroing neural networks (ZNNs). This innovation leads to a streamlined computational approach and convergence that does not rely on the convexity of the energy function. Compared to ZNN, standard GNN, and MATLAB&#8217;s quadprog, the FO-GNN offers enhanced precision and expedited convergence for both time-invariant and TVQP challenges.

The reliability of the SST is crucial. However, active switches are prone to failures, which can have severe consequences. For the matrix-type SST (MT-SST), the time-varying dc-link voltage poses challenges for accurate and rapid fault diagnosis. This article proposes a comprehensive fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control method for the open-circuit (OC) fault of a single switch in MT-SST. By comparing the estimated and measured values of the resonant capacitor voltages, the algorithm identifies the OC fault. Additionally, a reduction in the duty cycle of specific switches is introduced to assist in fault localization through monitoring of voltage changes. However, this method can only identify the OC fault on one side of MT-SST when the direction of power flow remains constant. To ensure fault tolerance, the primary and secondary side full-bridge is reconfigured into a quasi-half-bridge structure. The developed methods have the advantages simplicity and reliability. Finally, a 1.5 kW prototype is built, and the validity and feasibility of the proposed methods are verified.</description></item><item><title>Parameter Estimation of DAB Converter Using Intelligent Algorithms and Steady-State Modeling Considering Nonidealities</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10546328</link><description>Parameter estimation of dual active bridge (DAB) converters is a powerful tool in the applications of fault location, modulation strategy optimization, and preventive maintenance. However, most of the existing parameter estimation techniques often rely on costly experimental measurements and only estimate some converter parameters. To address these problems, we apply intelligence techniques to propose a flexible, generalized, and reliable multiparametric estimation methodology. Specifically, the circuit nonidealities, including the dead-time effect and the power loss, are considered to derive accurate open-loop and closed-loop steady-state models of the DAB converter. Then, the dynamic behavior and stability of the DAB converter are investigated based on those theoretical models. Next, a back-propagation (BP) neural network optimized by the genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to establish training models. Notably, the datasets used in training are generated from the derived DAB models, eliminating the need for parameter data collection from different converters. Finally, the accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability of the GA-BP are compared with traditional estimation methodologies and the pretrained BP model. Illustrative results demonstrate that the proposed intelligent approach is an effective approach for parameter estimation.</description></item><item><title>Online Bridge-Level Junction Temperature Evaluation of IGBTs via Emitter Parasitic Inductance Voltage Undershoot</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10530860</link><description>Insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) junction temperature evaluation is vital for health assessment. However, most of the existing IGBT junction temperature (Tj) evaluation approaches require the same number of detecting units and IGBTs. In this article, a thermosensitive electrical parameter based on the turn-off induced voltage veE undershoot between Kelvin and power emitters of lower IGBT for two IGBTs junction temperatures estimation in half-bridge module is proposed, which is independent of bond wires fatigue. The veE ringing of lower IGBT under designed time sequence has a good linear dependency with Tj of upper and lower IGBTs. An improved peak detector circuit is designed to extract the veE with no disruption to normal operation. Double-pulse test and three-phase converter platforms are built to verify the feasibility of industrial applications. Calibration results show that there is good linearity and high sensitivity between IGBT junction temperature and veE undershoot under various working conditions. Besides, the approach has high accuracy in junction temperature monitoring validated by infrared. Therefore, this novel bridge-level Tj estimation method has a good commercial prospect.</description></item><item><title>Interleaved Switching for Loss Minimization in Adjacent Cell-to-Cell Balancing Architectures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521813</link><description>The cell-to-cell variation in capacity and impedance leads to a charge imbalance within the battery pack, which tends to degrade its various states and the available energy. Therefore, a Battery Management System (BMS) equipped with a charge equalization circuit (CEC) will enhance the overall performance of the pack, resulting in improved electric range and grid storage capacity. The adjacent cell-to-cell (AC2C) architecture has a higher equalization loss because charge distribution is limited between adjacent cells and the hard-switching operation of their connected CECs. A charge equalization algorithm where interleaved switching of CECs with variable duty control is proposed in this article. The proposed switching operation improves the equalization loss by regulating the equalization current (rms and average) relative to the balanced state of the individual cell. To study the equalization performance for diverse scenarios of imbalance, a 48 V, 20 Ah pack with AC2C buck-boost CEC is configured in the PLECS simulation environment, where the proposed algorithm has achieved around 32% reduction in equalization loss. For experimental validation, an 18 V, 10.4 Ah LCO battery pack connected to the BMS and a series AC2C equalization unit are developed for the balancing operations.</description></item><item><title>A Digital Twin Approach for Online Impedance-Based Stability Analysis of Three-Phase AC Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10541872</link><description>In contemporary electrical distribution systems, multiple parallel inverters collaborate to form an advanced power distribution network, which poses stability challenges. Small-signal analysis is a fundamental method for characterizing interactions between system impedances. In three-phase ac systems, stability assessment involves examining the source-to-load impedance ratio in the complex dq plane using the Generalized Nyquist criterion (GNC). In this context, the digital twin (DT) concept is arising as the forefront of energy sector digitization, providing real-time data through high-fidelity models mirroring physical systems. This article presents a stability analysis method employing a DT approach to determine the closed-loop impedance of the physical system and estimate the connected system's equivalent impedance. Broadband excitation based on pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS) is applied with Fourier techniques for frequency response extraction. Impedance ratio assessment is performed on an edge-computing platform, delivering real-time stability information. Experimental results are provided for a dual-hybrid converter, one operating as a grid-forming system and the other in grid-following mode. The outcomes demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the proposal as a foundational approach to enhance robustness based on stability indexes.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Step-Wave AC Voltage Collection System for Renewable Energy Sources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10530354</link><description>To further reduce the losses and footprint of the key power conversion equipment in the conventional sine-wave alternating current (ac) voltage collection system for renewable energy sources, a novel step-wave ac voltage collection system is proposed in this letter, where the voltage on the point of common coupling (PCC) is regulated as a four-level step wave by sending end converter (SEC). With this particular waveform, the semiconductor switches in SEC are able to operate at only line frequency and two-level voltage source converter (VSC) can be used to eliminate the bulky capacitor of the MMC submodule. Therefore, the switching losses are significantly reduced compared with the conventional sine-wave voltage converters. Moreover, the direct current (dc) voltage utilization is improved by 10%. The power loss of the whole collection system can be reduced by 27.2% compared with the traditional sine-wave system using MMC. The effectiveness of the proposed system is verified by simulation and a 500&#160;W prototype.</description></item><item><title>Operating-Point-Parameterized State-Space Models of Black-Boxed Grid-Following Inverters for Maximum Transferable Active Power Prediction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10541860</link><description>This letter introduces an efficient method for analytically predicting the maximum transferable active power (MTAP) of a grid-following inverter (GFLI), considered as a black box, under any arbitrary short circuit ratio (SCR), X/R ratio, and reactive power injection level. By measuring the GFLI's admittance at several different operating points, an operating-point-parameterized state-space model (OPP SSM) is developed and exploited to predict the MTAP. The proposed method obviates the need for repetitive electromagnetic transient time-domain simulations or frequency-domain impedance criteria by gradually increasing active power output until the MTAP is reached. The feasibility of the synthesized OPP SSM for MTAP prediction has been experimentally validated on a power-controlled GFLI, demonstrating its potential for aiding the integration of inverter-based resources in modern power systems.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Two-Stage Benders Decomposition and Dual Dynamic Programming for Hydrothermal-Wind Planning With Intra-Stage Cost Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552437</link><description>The continuous increase of renewable energy sources (RES) brings challenges to electric power system planning, since RES effects must be considered in both short-term dispatch and mid/long-term planning (MLTP). In the latter, immediate or intra-stage cost functions (ICF or ISCF) have been proposed in the literature to provide thermal generation costs for each weekly/monthly stage, to address the uncertainty and high variability of RES without explicitly discretizing the stage in hourly steps. This work proposes a combined two-stage Benders decomposition and dual dynamic programming (DDP) approach to improve the construction and consideration of such ISCF for the MLTP problem. In this case, a set of subproblems considering hourly aspects as load curve, RES intermittency and peak capacity of hydro-generation are iteratively solved in the DDP master problem of each stage, for several scenarios of RES generation profiles, along DDP iterations. Since the discretization points of the ISCF are obtained on demand, this approach yields more accurate ISCF functions, specially in multi-area systems. The methodology is validated for both a tutorial case and a case based on data from the large-scale Brazilian system, where more realistic mid-term policies are obtained when compared to current approaches, with a reduced number of subproblems.</description></item><item><title>Graph Spatio-Temporal Networks for Condition Monitoring of Wind Turbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552429</link><description>Condition monitoring of wind turbines (WTs) is essential for advancing wind energy. Existing data-driven methods heavily rely on deep learning and big data, leading to challenges in distinguishing true faults from false alarms, impacting operational decisions negatively. Thus, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph neural network framework that incorporates prior knowledge. Prior WT knowledge is utilized by establishing a spatially structured directed graph embedded in a graph attention network (GAT). The features in WTs&#8217; supervisory control and data acquisition system are indicated by the nodes in GAT. Then, the global and local attention embedding layers as well as long short-term memory layers are employed to combine spatio-temporal information from each node. Finally, the condition monitoring in WTs&#8217; graph and node-level are established, and a fault propagation chain at node-level is constructed for explaining condition monitoring results. To demonstrate the explainability, robustness and sensitivity of the proposed approach, a comparative analysis between a true fault case and a false alarm case are given, and anomaly detection results are also reported.</description></item><item><title>Nonlinear Behavior and Transient Stability of Grid-Following Converters Using Direct Power Control Under Weak Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555420</link><description>Ensuring reliable operation of renewable energy sources requires robust grid-connected converters. Depending on the choice of synchronization methods, grid-connected converters may exhibit distinct nonlinear behavior that plays a vital role in determining their transient stability. Recently, the grid-voltage-modulated direct power control (DPC) has been proposed as an alternative to the conventional phase-locked loop (PLL) to enhance the dynamic response of the grid-following converter (GFLC). However, existing studies have primarily treated the DPC-based GFLC as a linear system. In this paper, we investigate the nonlinear behavior of this converter under weak grids using a large-signal model based on double reference frames. Our findings reveal that the DPC-based GFLC demonstrates sustained oscillation. Interestingly, the stable periodic orbit observed does not arise from a Hopf bifurcation but rather a saddle-node bifurcation of periodic orbits. This critical bifurcation is characterized by the coexistence of a stable periodic orbit and a stable equilibrium point, resulting in a sudden contraction of the converter's stability region. Furthermore, we provide a comparison between the nonlinear behavior of PLL-based GFLCs and DPC-based GFLCs. To validate our findings, we present full-circuit simulations and laboratory experiments.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Functional Integrated Converter for Dynamic Voltage Restoration and Reactive Power Compensation in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555312</link><description>Conventionally, parallel-connected or series-connected power quality control devices cannot compensate for both the voltage fluctuation and reactive power simultaneously. To improve the equipment utilization and reliability of the existing power quality control devices, a multi-functional integrated converter (MFIC) is proposed, which can effectively integrate the functions of both dynamic voltage restoration and reactive power compensation. When the grid voltage sags or swells, the MFIC works in the series access mode to achieve voltage regulation function. When the grid voltage is normal, the MFIC works in the parallel access mode to achieve unity power factor operation at the grid side. Compared with the traditional series-connected power quality control device, the MFIC only has one more coupling capacitor, markedly improving the utilization factor of equipment. In addition, the port voltage of the converter module in MFIC is clamped to zero when a short circuit or grounding fault occurs. Meanwhile, a large equivalent impedance is formed to effectively limit the line fault current, which improves the reliability of the MFIC itself and its connected grid as well. Furthermore, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed topology and strategy are verified by simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Power System Decarbonization: A Comparison Between Carbon Taxes and Forcing Coal Power Plant Retirements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555380</link><description>The U.S. power system faces a 2035 decarbonization target, though the exact pathway to the target remains unclear. Policy instruments, like carbon taxes and forcing coal plants to retire through various mechanisms, could help achieve the target. It is critical to analyze and compare decarbonization policies as different policies lead to different costs, emissions pathways, and political challenges. In this paper, we explore the ramifications of adopting alternative decarbonization policies. We assume a particular carbon tax to be the benchmark policy and compare it to alternative carbon tax and forced coal retirement policies in terms of emissions and costs. We use a power system dispatch model that co-optimizes unit commitment, energy, and frequency regulation capacity to simulate system evolution over multiple years, including retirements and renewables/storage expansion, under each policy. Our case study highlights the trade-offs between policies. We find that, counter-intuitively, higher carbon taxes do not always achieve lower emissions due to the complexity of dispatch, resulting profits and retirements, and the addition of renewables/storage. In contrast, forced coal retirements result in lower power system costs but higher emissions than the benchmark policy, with a large range of possible outcomes across different retirement cases.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Multistage Distribuionally Robust Programming to Hydrothermal Economic Dispatch With Renewable Energy Sources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561496</link><description>The multistage solution is very important to achieve optimal hydrothermal economic dispatch considering the uncertainty of renewable energy sources. In data-driven settings, only some historical trajectories are available and the probability distribution is unknown. A data-driven scheme for multistage stochastic hydrothermal economic dispatch with Markovian uncertainties is proposed in this paper. Then a data-driven distributionally robust stochastic dual dynamic programming (DDR-SDDP) is proposed to tackle the corresponding computational intractability, where the conditional probability distributions are estimated by using kernel regression. The out-of-sample performances are improved by distributionally robust optimization on a Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity set. Furthermore, a scenario aggregation method is designed to reduce the computational burden. Numerical results for a practical regional power system in China are presented and analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Co-Optimizing Distributed Energy Resources in Linear Complexity Under Net Energy Metering</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568387</link><description>The co-optimization of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources is considered for prosumers under the net energy metering tariff. The distributed energy resources considered include renewable generations, flexible demands, and battery energy storage systems. An energy management system co-optimizes the consumptions and battery storage based on locally available stochastic renewables by solving a stochastic dynamic program that maximizes the expected operation surplus. To circumvent the exponential complexity of the dynamic program solution, we propose a closed-form and linear computation complexity co-optimization algorithm based on a relaxation-projection approach to a constrained stochastic dynamic program. Sufficient conditions for optimality for the proposed solution are obtained. Numerical studies demonstrate orders of magnitude reduction of computation costs and significantly reduced optimality gap.</description></item><item><title>Control and Power Balancing of an Off-Grid Wind Turbine With Co-Located Electrolyzer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10569094</link><description>Co-locating electrolyzers and offshore wind can significantly reduce the cost of green hydrogen. However, without a grid connection, a new control paradigm is required for the electrolyzer to follow the variable power supplied by the wind turbine. Commercial electrolyzers have power ramp rate limitations, which can result in a mismatch between the wind turbine and electrolyzer power, leading to frequent shutdown and potentially unstable operation. This paper is the first to develop a control system for this off-grid operation with three mechanisms to dynamically balance the power, including energy storage, rotor inertia, and enhanced pitch control. The results show that a $6.8 million supercapacitor is required with a power rating and capacity of approximately 6.7 MW and 8.5 kWh to enable the system to operate through 99% of the annual wind variation. If the electrolyzer ramp rates can be doubled, the same operating hours can be achieved using only control-based power balancing methods at the cost of a marginal reduction in energy production. If commercial electrolyzer ramp rates can be tripled, the system is able to operate without the need for any power balancing.</description></item><item><title>Real-World Scale Deployment of Hydrogen-Integrated Microgrid: Design and Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571822</link><description>The development and utilization of hydrogen hold the potential to revolutionize new power systems by providing a clean and versatile energy carrier.

Addition of energy storage systems in an IBR power plant makes it feasible to have frequency control at the power plant level. While frequency control appears as a simple frequency-power droop control to adjust real power commands to inverter-level controls with measured frequency as an input, care must be taken to avoid interactions among the plant frequency control with communication delays, inverter-level control effects, and the frequency sensor, usually a phase-locked-loop (PLL). This paper present two types of interaction scenarios that makes frequency control design challenging. The first interaction scenario may occur if the frequency control's gain is large, while the second interaction scenario may occur at a small control gain if the plant-level PLL lacks sufficient damping. We contribute to the fundamental understanding of the causation of stability issues due to plant frequency control through the derivation of a simplified feedback system focusing on the frequency and power relationship, and the follow-up frequency-domain analysis for gaining insights. For validation, we also design a data-driven approach to obtain models from data generated from an electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation testbed. The findings from analysis have all been validated by EMT simulation. Finally, we contribute to mitigating strategies and also the understanding of the role of additional proportional integration power feedback control. This addition has been demonstrated as an efficient stability enhancement strategy to mitigate the effect of communication delay.</description></item><item><title>Differential Power Processing Based Control Framework for Multiple Battery Energy Storage Systems in DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10579077</link><description>Multiple battery energy storage systems (BESSs) have been widely used in the DC microgrids to balance generation and demand. To achieve this, the BESS converters need to deliver the full required input/output power imposed on BESSs under the conventional BESS-DC bus configuration, which often demands high power ratings for the converters, hence leads to high installation cost as well as high power losses. To reduce the power ratings for BESS converters while delivering the same power from BESSs, this paper proposes a new differential power processing (DPP) based control framework where the DPP techniques and BESSs are firstly combined without losing the following control objectives, namely, the accurate current-sharing and state of charge (SoC) balance of BESSs as well as DC bus voltage regulation. This is achieved first by introducing inverted bidirectional buck converters to function as a front-end converter and DPP converters. Then, a virtual state variable combining BESS output current and its SoC is proposed, based on which a consensus control strategy is proposed. The stability of the proposed DPP-based control framework is also analyzed. Finally, the real-time hardware-in-loop (HIL) tests confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control framework, showing that the proposed DPP-based control framework reduces the power ratings of the converters to less than 20 $\%$ of BESS converters used in conventional BESS-DC bus configuration even in the worst operating scenario, while delivering the same required power from BESSs, paving a way for an innovative BESS DC microgrid design with much down-sized converters for BESSs.</description></item><item><title>Replicating Power Flow Constraints Using Only Smart Meter Data for Coordinating Flexible Sources in Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10584114</link><description>The increasing integration of distributed energy resources necessitates effective coordination of flexible sources within distribution networks. Traditional model-based approaches require accurate topology and line parameters, which are often unavailable. Neural constraint replication can bypass this requirement, but it relies on complete nodal and branch measurements. However, in practice, only partial buses are monitored, while branches often remain unmeasured. To address this issue, this paper proposes a topology identification-incorporated neural constraint replication to replicate power flow constraints with only partial nodal measurements. Utilizing the additive property of line parameters, we develop a recursive bus elimination algorithm to recover topology and line impedance from power injection and voltage measurements on limited buses. We then estimate missing voltage and branch flow measurements based on the recovered model information. By combining observed and estimated measurements to construct training sets, we train neural networks to replicate voltage and branch flow constraints, which are subsequently reformulated into mixed-integer linear programming forms for efficient solving. Monte-Carlo simulations on various test systems demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed method, even with limited nodal measurements.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Power Tracking Performance and Small Signal Stability Analysis of Integrated Wind-to-Hydrogen System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10582460</link><description>To achieve the 2050 global climate target, offshore wind will increase to meet the growing demand of direct and indirect electrification (e.g. green hydrogen production for the hard-to-abate sector). To keep up with the rapid increase of offshore wind generation, the energy balancing challenges due to the intermittency nature of wind and the network congestion/capacity challenges resulting from structural network capacity planning latency are to be addressed with system integration technology. In this paper, it is proposed that the hydrogen electrolysis plant be co-located with the wind farm, where the power consumption is controlled to track the wind generation profile accurately to cancel the intermittency of wind generation, reduce the required grid connection capacity, and thereby avoid expensive grid expansion. However, this power tracking controller introduces a cross-plant feedback path from the wind farm to the hydrogen plant, posing challenges for partitioning the power tracking loop completely for stability analysis, which also makes it difficult to make a good trade-off between the tracking performance and stability margins. To address this issue, this paper proposes an equivalent transformation to eliminate the cross-plant feedback path. Then, the criteria for choosing the optimal partition method are proposed and examined for different types of partition methods, which are mathematically proven to be equivalent in terms of stability conditions but provide different insights. An optimal partition method is then proposed in this paper, which not only provides clear insight on the ideal and non-ideal power tracking performances but also can also identify the stability issues of different minor loops individually. Finally, the proposed optimal partition method and its valuable insights into power tracking performance and stability analysis are validated through time-domain simulations of a 180 MW integrated wind-to-hydrogen plant with a realistic complexity.</description></item><item><title>Toward on Rolling Optimal Dispatch Strategy Considering Alert Mechanism for Antarctic Electricity-Hydrogen-Heat Integrated Energy System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10582516</link><description>Renewable energy will be the important form of energy supply for future Antarctic scientific research station. This will complicate the dispatch of the Antarctic integrated energy system (IES), due to the harsh operation environment and diverse operation situation of the Antarctic system, especially for the problem of equipment outage caused by extreme weather. To cope with that, a rolling optimal dispatch method considering alert mechanism for Antarctic integrated energy system is proposed in this paper. First, the output of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is characterized by the feasible region and converted into a linear P-H-T model. By introducing the alert mechanism, a rolling optimal dispatch strategy is then established to ensure the security operation of the Antarctic integrated energy system. Furthermore, the normalized multiparametric disaggregation technology (NMDT) is presented to deal with the bilinear terms in dispatching formulation, in which a mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) is converted into mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Finally, case study is verified on the actual Antarctic energy system. The results indicates that the proposed fuel cell P-H-T model can enhance the flexibility and economy of the operation system. Also the load shedding can be reduced during the emergency operation by developed optimal dispatch strategy, which improves the resilience of IES.</description></item><item><title>Improving Resiliency of Cyber-Dependent Power Distribution Network Using UAVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10587086</link><description>Resiliency enhancement of the power distribution network (PDN) through restoration is paramount in the face of escalating natural disasters. State-of-the-art literature has centered on augmenting resiliency through network reconfiguration, along with the integration of renewable energy resources (RES) and mobile energy storage systems (MESS). However, these approaches often assume an intact communication infrastructure, a premise that fails to address the damage in the cyber or communication network (CN). This study introduces the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for wireless communication in the aftermath of communication infrastructure damage. Motivated by this, a comprehensive mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem-based restoration framework is proposed, aiming to elevate PDN resiliency considering a cyber-dependent PDN. This approach encompasses network reconfiguration, MESS, and UAV integration. The proposed method's efficacy is evaluated through rigorous testing and validation on the cyber-dependent IEEE 33 bus system and IEEE 123 bus system. This work pioneers a holistic approach to PDN resiliency, considering communication challenges often overlooked.</description></item><item><title>Fault Current Limiting and Grid Code Compliance for Grid-Forming Inverters&#8212;Part I: Problem Statement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589298</link><description>Grid-forming (GFM) inverters are controlled to directly regulate the voltage. A major challenge stemming from this control model is that sustaining the voltage during faults would require high currents&#8212;beyond the levels that an inverter can withstand. Various fault current limiting (FCL) methods have been developed in recent years for GFM inverter-based resources (IBRs). The theoretical analysis supported by detailed simulation studies in Part I of this paper investigates whether existing FCL methods for GFM inverters can be deemed feasible solutions for future IBR-centric power grids. The challenges revealed for the first time in this paper are multifaceted and depend on the type of the FCL method. The focus is not only on a GFM inverter's internal operation, but also on its impact on the grid and the practical requirements for grid integration of an IBR considering most recent grid codes. Part II of this paper will address these challenges.</description></item><item><title>Fault Current Limiting and Grid Code Compliance for Grid-Forming Inverters &#8212; Part II: Solution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589281</link><description>Part I of this paper unveiled various shortcomings of existing fault current limiting (FCL) methods for grid-forming (GFM) inverters. Part II of this paper develops a new FCL method that overcomes these drawbacks. Additionally, the FCL method proposed in this paper follows the strict requirements of recent grid codes for the low-voltage ride-through mode of inverter-based resources (IBRs). This makes the exact response of GFM inverters during faults fully predictable. Such predictability is a prerequisite for the reliable design/setting of protection systems, operation, and planning of power grids with high penetration of IBRs. The paper uses PSCAD simulations to corroborate if the proposed method meets these objectives. It also uses simulation results to compare this new method with existing FCL solutions for GFM inverters.</description></item><item><title>Per-Phase Unsymmetrical Adaptive Derivative Optimized Droop for Mitigating Voltage Quality Issues of Unbalanced Islanded Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589303</link><description>The proliferation of unbalanced linear and nonlinear loads in microgrids degrades the voltage quality at the inverter terminals, and thus, load terminals receive unbalanced and distorted voltages. To alleviate these voltage quality issues, this paper proposes a per-phase unsymmetrical adaptive derivative optimized droop control scheme for unbalanced islanded microgrids (UIMG). The proposed controller is coupled with a per-phase unsymmetrical virtual impedance (UVI) to mitigate the unbalance of the inverter-based UIMG. Additionally, a proportional multi-resonant (PMR) controller is adopted to compensate for the voltage distortion. To improve the UIMG dynamics response while changing the loading states, derivative terms of active and reactive powers are added to the proposed control. The derivative gains are adaptively updated with the change in the microgrid loading to achieve the desired transient response. The proposed scheme is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem to determine the per-phase unsymmetrical droop settings and UVI that fit different loading states simultaneously. Several case studies are designed to test the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme under different types of disturbances and operating conditions. The cases are conducted on the IEEE 34-bus benchmark power distribution feeder with a combination of unbalanced linear and nonlinear loads. Moreover, the proposed control is validated using real-time simulations carried out in OPAL-RT system. The results show that the proposed control scheme is capable of mitigating voltage quality issues by reducing the voltage unbalance factor and voltage distortion.</description></item><item><title>Design and Tank Testing of Reinforcement Learning Control for Wave Energy Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10592659</link><description>This paper introduces a model-free control strategy utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the electrical power generation of a point absorber wave energy converter (WEC). While model-based methods may suffer from control performance degradation due to modeling errors, such as inherent Coulomb-type friction, RL-based approaches are well-suited for the WEC environment, where system dynamics are complex or unknown. The strength lies in their ability to learn from interactions with the environment, bypassing the necessity for precise models. To enhance the control performance in electrical power generation, a control-oriented loss model is established, and a force penalty term is introduced into the reward function to avoid the WEC system operating in high-loss, low-efficiency regions. To further eliminate the reliance on wave information and improve applicability, an analysis is conducted to examine the contribution of each state feature to the training outcomes and a loss-considering and wave information-independent RL-based control scheme is developed. The RL-based controller is further validated on a point absorber WEC prototype in the wave tank experiment, demonstrating effective implementation and commendable performance in both regular and irregular waves.</description></item><item><title>Towards Improving Unit Commitment Economics: An Add-On Tailor for Renewable Energy and Reserve Predictions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10592660</link><description>Generally, day-ahead unit commitment (UC) is conducted in a predict-then-optimize process: it starts by predicting the renewable energy source (RES) availability and system reserve requirements; given the predictions, the UC model is then optimized to determine the economic operation plans. In fact, predictions within the process are raw. In other words, if the predictions are further tailored to assist UC in making the economic operation plans against realizations of the RES and reserve requirements, UC economics will benefit significantly. To this end, this paper presents a cost-oriented tailor of RES-and-reserve predictions for UC, deployed as an add-on to the predict-then-optimize process. The RES-and-reserve tailor is trained by solving a bi-level mixed-integer programming model: the upper level trains the tailor based on its induced operating cost; the lower level, given tailored predictions, mimics the system operation process and feeds the induced operating cost back to the upper level; finally, the upper level evaluates the training quality according to the fed-back cost. Through this training, the tailor learns to customize the raw predictions into cost-oriented predictions. Moreover, the tailor can be embedded into the existing predict-then-optimize process as an add-on, improving the UC economics. Lastly, the presented method is compared to traditional, binary-relaxing, neural network-based, stochastic, and robust methods.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Controller of a Hybrid Storage System for Power Smoothing With Enlarged Battery Lifetime</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596967</link><description>The volatility of grid-coupled photovoltaics can cause local voltage deviations, while the impact on frequency becomes obvious in isolated weak grids. Thus, a standalone battery is usually proposed for smoothing purposes. However, the frequent cycles and abrupt power variations shrink its life and impair control performance. To this end, this study introduces a controller for a hybrid system composed of a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) and a battery. The proposed method establishes an idling zone for battery to eliminate its short-term activity, while SMES handles any power mismatch. The zone limits are dynamically adjusted in case of power balance detection, while an adaptive saturation is applied to them for maximal SMES utilization and minimal battery degradation. When SMES current deviates from this zone, battery operates with an adaptive ramp rate (i.e., di/dt) depending on the state of charge of SMES, to further optimize its life. Additionally, to prevent unnecessary power circulation among SMES and battery, supervisory control loops are implemented. Finally, to evaluate this scheme against preceding controllers regarding battery life extension, a real-time approach is followed using a dedicated simulator, while a hardware-in-the-loop verification is presented using an actual controller.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability of Synchronous Condenser Co-Located With Renewable Power Plants Under High-Resistance Faults and Risk Mitigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599822</link><description>Synchronous condensers (SynCons) are widely used in supporting the integration of renewable power plants (RPPs) in weak grids. However, recent research suggests that a SynCon co-located with RPPs may be prone to transient rotor angle instability due to the excessive active power injected by nearby RPPs during metallic faults. This paper further discovers that the transient stability of the SynCon may be lost even it generates electrical power during high-resistance faults. This novel mechanism of instability is investigated by deriving power-angle characteristics in different fault scenarios, and then the effect of the system parameters on the stability is analyzed via a proposed index based on the critical clearance time (CCT). It reveals that inappropriate parameters of SynCons, weak grid, and voltage support during fault ride-through (FRT) all contribute to such transient instability. To mitigate such instability, an adaptive FRT strategy is proposed. The electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations based on the PSCAD are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis and the proposed adaptive control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Chance Constrained Optimization Method for Risk-Based Routing and Scheduling of Shared Mobile Energy Storage System With Variable Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599624</link><description>This paper proposes a pricing and scheduling method for shared mobile energy storage systems (SMSs) in coupled power distribution and transportation networks. Different from existing shared energy storage studies, which mostly focus on stationary resources, the paper investigates the SMS operation considering the negotiation of rental prices as well as mobility and charging/discharging among SMS owners and different users. Specifically, the SMS pricing and scheduling with variable renewable energy are established as a bilevel mixed-integer chance-constrained distributionally robust optimization problem. In the upper-level problem, the SMS owner determines pricing and day-ahead mobility strategy to maximize its payoff. In the lower-level problem, the SMS users, i.e., distribution grid operators, determine the SMS charging/discharging power according to the SMS day-ahead pricing results and intra-day distribution grid operation strategies for accommodating variable renewable energy. The distributionally robust chance constraint is designed to cope with the intra-day operational risk caused by the variability of renewable power generation. To cope with the solution difficulty in the proposed bilevel optimization problem, the chance constraint is reformulated as second-order cone constraints, which are further transformed into a set of linear constraints, and then the reformulated bilevel mixed-integer linear programming problem is decomposed and iteratively solved to avoid enumerating lower-level integer variables. Simulation results show that the utilization rate of SMS batteries is increased and the excess renewable power is fully consumed when SMSs are shared among different distribution grids. The proposed distributionally robust optimization achieves higher revenue for the SMS owner and smaller operating costs of distribution grids than robust optimization under uncertain environments.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Indexes for Variable Energy Resource Generation in IEEE Standard 762-2023</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10602780</link><description>IEEE Standard Definitions for Use in Reporting Electric Generating Unit Reliability, Availability, and Productivity has recently been revised to extend the standard to variable energy resource (VER) generating facilities.

Thus, an adjustable robust tri-level defender-attacker-defender (ART-DAD) model is proposed to improve the resilience of power systems by hardening critical transmission lines. The proposed ART-DAD model considers both uncertain attacks and uncertain wind power output, which provides meaningful insights into the resilience improvement of power systems that involve uncertainties. More specifically, the proposed defense model integrates dynamic N-K criterion for attack budgets and the polyhedral uncertainty set for wind power output to develop resilient line hardening strategies. The proposed defense model can be formulated as a mixed integer tri-level programming problem that is decoupled into a master and sub-problem. Then, a constraint-generation based solution algorithm is proposed to solve the overall ART-DAD model with a master and sub-problem scheme. Simulation results on IEEE RTS-79 and RTS-96 systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed resilience improving strategy.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Multi-Mode Single-Step Power Tracking for Microinverter-Based Photovoltaic System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10612237</link><description>The conventional de-load power tracking algorithm, utilizing a perturb and observe method, manifests deficiencies in terms of speed, stability, and efficacy in identifying operating points within the inverter's voltage range.

However, existing data-driven methods cannot be applied to new wind farms due to the lack of operational data. This paper presents a novel Bayesian deep learning-based adaptive wind farm power prediction (BDL-AWFPP) method, which is the first time to utilize the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation results as the prior of BDL-based method, thus avoiding the problem that data-driven approaches cannot be applied to newly constructed wind farms. Firstly, a CFD-based wind farm numerical simulation database and a wind turbine power curve database are established to construct a multi-source heterogeneous prior dataset. Then, the BDL-AWFPP model is proposed to utilize the multi-source heterogeneous prior dataset, which can be updated adaptively with newly acquired operational data and saved periodically throughout the life cycle. And an auxiliary aging assessment method for wind turbines is also developed according to the periodically-saved models. Finally, a stochastic variational inference (SVI)-based parameter updating algorithm is derived for the proposed BDL-AWFPP model. Case studies on an actual wind farm validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Net-Zero Scheduling of Multi-Energy Building Energy Systems: A Learning-Based Robust Optimization Approach With Statistical Guarantees</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620675</link><description>Buildings produce a significant share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, making homes and businesses a major factor in climate change. To address this critical challenge, this paper explores achieving net-zero emission through the carbon-aware optimal scheduling of the multi-energy building integrated energy systems (BIES). We integrate advanced technologies and strategies, such as the carbon capture system (CCS), power-to-gas (P2G), carbon tracking, and emission allowance trading, into the traditional BIES scheduling problem. The proposed model enables accurate accounting of carbon emissions associated with building energy systems and facilitates the implementation of low-carbon operations. Furthermore, to address the challenge of accurately assessing uncertainty sets related to forecasting errors of loads, generation, and carbon intensity, we develop a learning-based robust optimization approach for BIES that is robust in the presence of uncertainty and guarantees statistical feasibility. The proposed approach comprises a shape learning stage and a shape calibration stage to generate an optimal uncertainty set that ensures favorable results from a statistical perspective. Numerical studies conducted based on both synthetic and real-world datasets have demonstrated that the approach yields up to 8.2% cost reduction, compared with conventional methods, in assisting buildings to robustly reach net-zero emissions.</description></item><item><title>Deriving Sufficient Conditions for Exact Relaxation of Complementarity Constraints in Optimization Problems With Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10629239</link><description>Energy storage is becoming increasingly important in power and energy systems. However, its strongly nonconvex complementarity constraints, which prevent simultaneous charging or discharging behavior, hinder its application in optimization-based decision making. One remedy is to relax these constraints, but the existing relaxation methods are specific to power system applications with limited universality. To bridge this gap, we provide a methodology to derive the general form of sufficient conditions for the exact relaxation of a general energy storage-concerned optimization problem (ESCOP). Specific sufficient conditions for a wide range of ESCOPs can be easily accessed via the proposed methodology. This paper provides mathematical proofs and analyses of the proposed conditions, where sufficient conditions obtained from specific forms of ESCOPs are numerically validated to guarantee exact relaxation and significantly improve the ESCOP solution efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Joint Electricity and Carbon Sharing With PV and Energy Storage: A Low-Carbon DR-Based Game Theoretic Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623777</link><description>This paper proposes a joint electricity and carbon sharing framework with photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage system (ESS) for deep decarbonization, allowing distributed PV prosumers to participate in a sharing network established by aggregator of prosumers (AOP). The ESS-equipped AOP plays multiple roles as a carbon aggregator, an ESS operator, and an energy-sharing provider at the same time. First, a demand response (DR)-based model that incorporates the multi-strategy of ESS is proposed to optimize energy-carbon transaction. A low-carbon DR with consideration of electricity-carbon coupling is developed to incentivize prosumers to adjust consumption behavior for costs and emissions reduction. Second, a joint optimization based on Stackelberg game is proposed, where AOP is leader, and prosumers act as followers. A dynamic pricing mechanism is proposed for AOP to determine the electricity-carbon coupled selling and buying prices simultaneously. Meanwhile, prosumers would adjust their energy consumption as response to different sharing prices. In addition, a distributed optimization algorithm with interactions is used to reach the Stackelberg game equilibrium. Finally, through a practical testing case, the effectiveness of the method is validated in terms of economic benefits and PV sharing enhancement, as well as the reduction of carbon emissions.</description></item><item><title>Cooperative Planning of Multi-Energy System and Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10631701</link><description>Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) can play critical roles in transitioning to global net-zero emissions. However, existing works only focus on small-scale or local CO2 utilization. For the first time, this paper proposes a cooperative planning model of multi-energy system and CCUS considering the regional CO2 availability. In this model, the multi-energy system and CCUS are coupled through interconnected energy hubs. To leverage its inherent operational dispatchability and flexibility, the physicochemical and thermo-electrochemical processes of CCUS are mathematically formulated with source-sink matching analysis. The multi-energy planning is a demanding optimization challenge owing to its inherent nonconvexities and substantial energy-interest couplings. The original problem is firstly relaxed as mixed integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) to ensure satisfactory computational efficiency. A carbon-oriented bargaining problem can then be reformulated to share the cooperative surplus, which is further decomposed into a joint investment/operation subproblem and a cost-sharing subproblem. The proposed methodology is benchmarked over interconnected energy hub systems to show its effectiveness and superiority in technical, economic, and environmental aspects.</description></item><item><title>Semi-Peer-to-Peer Safety Coordination Control for Distributed Battery Energy Storage System in DC Microgrids via Saturated Limitation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10631704</link><description>This paper presents a semi-peer coordination control strategy to ensure the bus voltage stability and effectively constrain the power trajectory, thereby mitigating safety concerns arising from excessive unit power and communication failures in distributed battery energy storage systems (DBESS) based DC microgrids. Firstly, the primary controller is employed a saturated feedforward design to maintain bus voltage stability and address the excessive part of power allocation with droop control. The saturation results enable flexible switching of the reference state, allowing energy storage units (ESUs) to autonomously transition between voltage tracking and power tracking modes. Secondly, the dual-dynamic power allocation strategy is introduced with distributed consensus and saturation allocation.The power allocation with distributed consensus aims to achieve synchronous proportional charging and discharging for SOC balancing. For the offline ESUs of communication failures, saturation power allocation is designed with arrived operation point to avoid the over-utilization of offline ESUs. To address potential communication failures in offline ESUs, the saturation power allocation strategy based on the current operational point is devised to mitigate the risk of over-utilization of offline ESUs. Finally, simulations and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>An Equitable Active Power Curtailment Framework for Overvoltage Mitigation in PV-Rich Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10636072</link><description>There are various active power curtailment (APC) approaches to mitigate overvoltage. In PV-rich networks, the overvoltage happens to be especially at the end of the distribution feeders. While APC helps maintain voltage within operational limits, it results in varying degrees of renewable curtailment for each prosumer. This curtailment increases as the distance from the transformer grows. Hence, these approaches introduce unfairness among prosumers. This study proposes an equitable APC (EAPC) based on the prosumer's self-consumption rate (SCR). The method calculates each prosumer's SCR, compares it with the precalculated critical SCR, and calculates a fair share of curtailment for each prosumer. Subsequently, leveraging the voltage sensitivity matrix obtained from the inverse of the Jacobian matrix, the new active power injection at the point of common coupling (PCC) is calculated to mitigate the overvoltage. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, a comparison with three other methods is presented under various PV penetration levels. The proposed EAPC is less sensitive to the prosumer's location and improves fairness among prosumers. In addition, a battery deployment scenario is analysed considering the annual supply and demand balance to suppress the extra curtailment introduced by EAPC without increasing the battery capacity.</description></item><item><title>Shape Optimization of a Point Absorber Wave Energy Converter for Reduced Current Drag and Improved Wave Energy Capture Using Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638322</link><description>The shape of the floating buoy of a point absorber wave energy converter (WEC) plays a crucial role in both wave energy harvesting and current drag reduction. In this study, an approach to optimizing the buoy hull geometry with a neural network that replaces the hydrodynamic analysis software is presented, aimed at reducing the ocean current drag force while improving wave energy captured. A new parametric model is introduced to describe the complex shape of the buoy by utilizing the control points of non-uniform rational b-splines. A neural network is developed to significantly reduce the computational time compared to traditional hydrodynamic simulation methods. The optimal hull shape of the buoy is determined by solving an optimization problem using a genetic algorithm, a global optimization technique. The results of the case studies show that the optimal buoy hull shape reduces 68.7% and 71.1% of the current drag, and 50% of mooring line forces compared to the cylinder-shaped buoy and the optimal-power-shaped hull from literature. The optimal buoy hull shape increases the wave energy extraction by 46.1% compared to the thin-ship-shaped buoy but performs 21.1% worse than the optimal-power-shaped hull from the literature.</description></item><item><title>Electric Energy Maximization for Oscillating Water Column Wave Energy Systems Using a Receding-Horizon Pseudospectral Control Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10636763</link><description>Among the various wave energy technologies, oscillating water columns (OWCs) have shown some of the greatest promise, due to their simplicity of operation and possibility for shore mounting, with consequent ease of access and integration with other infrastructure, such as breakwaters. To minimize the levelized cost of energy, OWC energy capture must be maximized. To date, most focus has been on maximizing air turbine efficiency, while neglecting other aspects of the system. This paper presents an integrated wave-to-wire optimal control approach, considering the OWC hydrodynamics, turbine characteristics, and generator. The approach is based on a receding-horizon pseudospectral formulation, which transcribes the continuous-time optimal control problem into a finite-dimensional nonlinear program. The results show optimal exploitation of the hydrodynamic, aerodynamic, and electric subsystem efficiency characteristics, surpassing the electric energy production available through a specific focus on turbine efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Comparative Evaluation of Converter Control Impact on Torsional Dynamics of Type-IV Grid-Forming Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637722</link><description>This paper explores the impact of back-to-back converter control strategies on the torsional dynamics of grid-forming permanent magnet synchronous generator wind turbines (GFM-WTs). Two general converter control methods for GFM-WTs, distinguished by the placement of dc-link voltage control (DVC)&#8211;either in the machine-side converter or the grid-side converter, are evaluated through the complex torque coefficient method to offer a theoretical basis. It reveals that a negative damping is introduced when the DVC is with the machine-side converter. Then, to further characterize the parametric impacts of electrical and mechanical system constants and controller gains, the sensitivity analysis is performed by employing the partial derivative algorithm, which is based on the feedforward neural network training. It is found that the converter control has a limited impact on the damped frequency in both GFM converter control methods.

While the HVAC power consumption forecasting task is generally straightforward with sufficient historical data, it becomes challenging when dealing with scarce data. Such situation is common in cases of intermittent data collection or early system implementations, where precise forecasting is required despite limited data available. Considering accessible datasets from nearby or similar HVAC systems through energy management systems, this paper proposes an adaptive transfer learning framework to tackle this issue. Specifically, the framework leverages diverse source domains, employing model-level regularizers to quantify domain discrepancies and an adaptive parameter regulation mechanism to dynamically align source domains with the target domain. Embedded within the framework, a unique deep learning architecture with attention mechanisms is proposed, capable of identifying complex temporal patterns and hierarchical features in HVAC systems. Experiments on public HVAC datasets demonstrate the generalization, accuracy and robustness of our methodology under diverse data-scarce scenarios.</description></item><item><title>A Novel GAN Architecture Reconstructed Using Bi-LSTM and Style Transfer for PV Temporal Dynamics Simulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10601515</link><description>The stochastic production simulation of photovoltaic (PV) power is crucial for the analysis of power balance in power planning, annual or monthly operational planning, and long-term transactions in the electricity market, especially in power systems with a high share of PVs.

However, existing LFO analyses lack the consideration of microgrids&#8217; required rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and steady-state active power-frequency (P-f) characteristics when designing the VSG&#8217;s inertia and damping. With these practical considerations, this paper reveals that the interactions between VSGs can cause significant LFOs, posing a threat to the microgrid&#8217;s stability. In contrast, the LFOs related to the interactions between SGs are less pronounced. To this end, a distributed LFO damping (DLFOD) control is proposed to suppress the LFOs between VSGs from two aspects: the adjustment of the VSG&#8217;s phase angle mitigates the uneven instantaneous active power sharing, while the adjustment of the VSG&#8217;s active power setpoint enhances the mutual damping. Compared with existing methods, the proposed DLFOD control 1) pertains to multi-bus microgrids, 2) guarantees the RoCoF and steady-state P-f characteristics, and 3) possesses a linear structure. Furthermore, a dynamic switching variable is devised to handle the disconnection and reconnection of communication links or VSGs, which enables the DLFOD control to remain partially functional during these interruptions. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated through theoretical analysis, real-time simulations, and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Parameter Boundary Characterization for DC Microgrid Islanding Detection Based on Time-Domain Voltage Oscillation Trajectory Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571933</link><description>Unintentional islanding events cause potential threats to the safety of dc microgrids. Selected frequency islanding detection is considered a promising technology thanks to its good power quality and high detection accuracy. However, the conventional frequency-domain-based islanding detection parameter boundary cannot consider the impact of detection time, which causes a quite slow detection speed and thus leads to detection failure. To overcome this obstacle, a linear model of the islanding dc system is developed first to analyze the steady-state response of the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC). On top of that, the components of the islanding system characteristic equation are analyzed based on modal analysis, which lays a good foundation for simplifying the time-domain response model of the PCC voltage. Then, the oscillation trajectory of the PCC voltage triggered by the islanding event is characterized in the time domain, which facilitates the analysis and calculation of islanding detection time. Furthermore, the boundary of the islanding detection parameters considering the detection time effect is accurately depicted to guide the resonator design. In this manner, the effect of resonant parameters on the detection time can be evaluated visually while the fast detection speed is also ensured. Finally, the proposed method is validated in simulations and hardware-in-loop experiments.</description></item><item><title>Research on Generic Diagnostic Methods for Short-Circuit Faults in AC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10580987</link><description>Micro grid fault of rapid detection and removal is the key to ensure its reliability. With the access of many distributed generations (DG) to the system, the characteristics of short-circuit faults of microgrids in grid-connected and islanded modes have changed, and the traditional protection methods can no longer be applied to both operating modes of microgrids simultaneously. Due to the advantages of wavelet energy spectrum in the identification of the mutation characteristics of the weak signal as well as that of neural network in the location accuracy, this paper proposes a short circuit fault detection and protection method in AC microgrids. The method takes the current at the detection point as the object of analysis, uses the wavelet energy spectrum transform to analyze the current waveforms under normal and fault operation states, and extracts the fault characteristic quantities. At the same time, considering the effect of transition resistance, a generalized fault area identification model for both grid-connected and islanded modes is established by using a neural network algorithm. Simulation and experimental results show that this method can realize accurate judgment and area location of short-circuit faults in different modes, different DG capacities, different fault types and different fault regions.</description></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Review of High-Frequency AC Microgrids for Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586271</link><description>Continuous advancements in distributed generation, energy storage, electric vehicles, and industrial modernization have forced the electrical distribution system to operate efficiently and controllably. To address these challenges, in addition to ensuring efficient bidirectional power flow while minimizing power losses, a comprehensive grid restructuring is crucial. The deployment of a high-frequency AC (HFAC) microgrid has emerged as a feasible solution, offering the potential to establish a reliable and efficient energy supply that aligns with the demands of the current distribution landscape.

A multi-objective optimal control problem with multiple control/state variables, multiple control/state constraints, and multiple boundary conditions is introduced to reduce power losses, prevent the HESS from oscillations, and increase source lifespan, which is handled by using an alternative Pontryagin&#8217;s minimum principle and inheriting finite difference methods. On that foundation, the multi-objective Global optimal Benchmark for uG (referred to as GoBuG) is constructed and assessed via several numerical scenarios, including a real case study of a uG located in B&#7841;ch Long V&#297; island, Vi&#7879;t Nam. The assessment shows that GoBuG is tens of times faster than conventional methods like dynamic programming when computing EMS in the islanded uG with a single battery ESS. Moreover, for uG consisting of HESSs, while dynamic programming is unable to provide solutions, GoBuG remains superior with high accuracy, reliability, and speedy computation. With its superior performance, the proposed GoBuG is therefore compatible with benchmarking purposes for general uG systems.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Robust State Estimation for Large-Scale Low-Observability Power-Transportation System Based on Meta Physics-Informed Graph TimesNet</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10554998</link><description>The ever-increasing penetration of Electric Vehicles (EVs) has emerged as an evident challenge within the Power Distribution System (PDS). Existing Distribution System State Estimation (DSSE) models are constrained by the low-observability and often neglect the spatio-temporal correlations inherent in the PDS. To address this, our study proposes a robust learning architecture named meta physics-informed graph TimesNet that can effectively learn the evolving topology of the PDS, as well as capture the spatio-temporal correlations of the PDS state, even under the condition of limited data availability. The model leverages a combination of a graph convolutional network and TimesNet as the foundational modules for constructing an encoder-decoder framework. Furthermore, to capture the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of the PDS state, our study inserts a topology learning module driven by a meta physics-informed graph bank into the encoder-decoder framework. Subsequently, power flow calculations are performed on the predicted power to reduce error accumulation. The IEEE 8500-node test feeder and UTD19 are utilized as the datasets for the PDS and urban transportation system, respectively. By using 42 electric vehicle charging stations as coupling points, a novel large-scale power-transportation coupled system dataset is constructed through multi-source information fusion. The performance of our proposed model on this dataset has shown to surpass existing DSSE methods in terms of accuracy (MAPE, etc.) and effectiveness, particularly considering the increasing prevalence of EVs.

Subsequently, a data-driven cooperative adaptive controller is designed to coordinate multiple PV inverters as a cluster. The method can effectively regulate the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) of the controlled PV cluster with adaptability to system changes. The stability of the proposed control method is theoretically clarified. Numerical simulation using MATLAB/Simulink shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Islanding Partition and Scheduling Strategy for Service Restoration of Active Distribution Networks Considering Minimum Sustainable Duration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609444</link><description>This paper presents a coordinated islanding partition and scheduling strategy for service restoration of active distribution networks (ADNs) to maximize weighted restored energy considering the minimum sustainable duration (MSD) of controllable islands (CIs). To avoid the forming of uncontrollable islands, the concept of dominated buses is proposed and integrated into the topological model of ADNs for islanding partition. The co-optimization of mobile distributed generator (MDG) dispatch and dominated bus identification is carried out to accelerate the restoration process. The MSD of CIs is explicitly modeled, and the CIs are scheduled in a risk-adjusted way, whose conservatism can be adjusted by controlling the predefined risk confidence level. Interruptible loads are considered as flexible resources in the islanding partition strategy considering the effects of the MSD of CIs. To improve the practicability of the presented method, time-varying power demands and distributed renewable generation outputs are incorporated into the presented framework. The studied problem is formulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone programming model, which can be efficiently solved by commercial solvers. Finally, a modified version of the Pacific Gas and Electric Company 69-bus distribution system, a practical medium-voltage distribution system in Denmark, and a modified IEEE 123-bus distribution system are employed to demonstrate the performance of the developed model.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Risk-Averse Optimal Dispatch for Integrated Power and Transportation System Considering Carbon Trading</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10556757</link><description>With the global climate change, the significance of carbon emission reduction is widely recognized. As an effective tool for emission reduction, carbon trading needs to be considered in the operation of the integrated power and transportation system (IPTS). This paper proposes a distributed risk-averse optimal dispatch scheme for IPTS considering carbon trading. First, a carbon trading framework for IPTS is developed, in which the microgrids (MGs) within the power distribution system (PDS) and the electric vehicle agent (EVA) of the transportation system (TS) jointly participate in the carbon trading market. Furthermore, the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) method is used in the proposed scheme to manage the risks arising from diverse uncertainties, including power load, renewable power generation, traffic demand, and carbon price. To protect the privacy of the PDS and TS and improve computational performance, the spectral penalty parameter based alternating direction method of multipliers (S-ADMM) distributed solution method is developed to solve the IPTS dispatch model. Numerical results on two test systems illustrate the economic and carbon reduction benefits, risk management ability, and computational performance of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Supervised Optimization Framework for Charging and Discharging Controls of Battery Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561610</link><description>Although residential houses have widely adopted battery energy storage (BES) in conjunction with solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, it has been challenging to optimize BES controls owing to the uncertainty inherent in electricity prices, renewable energy resources, and electricity demand loads. The main objective of this study is to propose a supervised optimization (SO) framework designed to enable supervised learning to infer efficient BES operations in conjunction with mathematical optimization. Based on the proposed SO framework, a mathematical optimization model is formulated and solved to generate optimal charging and discharging controls given historical data in an offline optimization fashion.

Numerical experiments are conducted with data collected from a residential community in Texas, and the results reveal that the proposed SO framework results in better performance compared to the benchmark model, such as reinforcement learning and model predictive control.</description></item><item><title>Asynchronous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning-Based Framework for Bi-Level Noncooperative Game-Theoretic Demand Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566880</link><description>Demand response (DR) is proposed to address the uncertainty of distributed energy resources (DER) and energy storage systems in distribution networks. However, current research neglects the temporal relationships and the noncooperative relationship of demand response participants. A novel bi-level non-cooperative Stackelberg-Nash dynamic game-theoretic framework is proposed in this paper, specifically designed to address the issue of overlooking consumers&#8217; interests and temporal relationships of participant actions in traditional demand response frameworks. Within this innovative framework, an asynchronous multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed and named as Stackelberg-Nash multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm (SN-MAPPO). SN-MAPPO allows utility company (UC) and consumers to maximize their utilities within the proposed framework, ultimately leading to the convergence of UC and consumers&#8217; strategies to Stackelberg-Nash equilibrium. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, simulations are conducted using authentic data, involving one UC and eight power consumers. Simulation results confirm that the proposed demand response mechanism, while safeguarding consumers&#8217; benefits, fosters the integration of distributed energy resource and effectively mitigates load fluctuations.</description></item><item><title>Eliminating Distribution Network Congestion Based on Spatial-Temporal Migration of Multiple Base Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571587</link><description>The integration of high proportions of distributed energy resources and the soaring development of 5G base stations (BSs) could lead to operational issues such as grid congestion in distribution networks. Meanwhile, 5G BSs can also serve as the flexible resources to support the distribution network. In this regard, this paper proposes a novel method to eliminate distribution network congestion with spatial-temporal migration of multiple base stations (BSs). First, the collaborative structure of the distribution network operator (DNO) and mobile network operator (MNO) is presented and the event-driven congestion management framework of the distribution network with multiple BSs is illustrated. Secondly, the specific spatial-temporal migration models of multiple BSs are established, which contain traffic migration, BS sleeping, and dispatchable capacity of the BS backup energy storage system.

Finally, the modified IEEE 33-node and IEEE 123-node distribution system are adopted for case studies, from numerical analysis we can draw that, the proposed congestion management method can alleviate the congestion issue of the distribution network effectively while reducing costs of both DNO and MNO.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserved Aggregate Thermal Dynamic Model of Buildings</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10577505</link><description>The thermal inertia of buildings brings considerable flexibility to the heating and cooling load, which is known to be a promising demand response resource. The aggregate model that can describe the thermal dynamics of the building cluster is an important interference for energy systems to exploit its intrinsic thermal inertia. However, the private information of users, such as the indoor temperature and heating/cooling power, needs to be collected in the parameter estimation procedure to obtain the aggregate model, causing severe privacy concerns. In light of this, we propose a novel privacy-preserved parameter estimation approach to infer the aggregate model for the thermal dynamics of the building cluster for the first time. Using it, the parameters of the aggregate thermal dynamic model (ATDM) can be obtained by the load aggregator without accessing the individual&#8217;s privacy information. More specifically, this method not only exploits the block coordinate descent (BCD) method to resolve its non-convexity in the estimation but investigates the transformation-based encryption (TE) and the secure aggregation protocol (SAP) methods to realize privacy-preserved computation. Its capability of preserving privacy is also theoretically proven. Finally, simulation results using real-world data demonstrate the accuracy and privacy-preserved performance of our proposed method.</description></item><item><title>POMDP-Based Dispatch Scheme for Residential Distributed Energy Resources Under Customer Fatigue Consideration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10577471</link><description>With rapidly growing penetration of renewable energy, there is an increasing need for real-time balance in the power system. In recent years, as a vital component of the end user side, residential distributed energy resources (RDER) have shown promising prospects in demand response (DR). This paper addresses the RDER optimal dispatch problem from an online learning perspective. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and the logistic regression model are employed to describe how the DR service contractor learns the uncertain response model of the customer affected by the fatigue and recovery effect. A non-stationary combinatorial multi-armed bandit paradigm is applied to dispatch RDER. In addition, we use the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) technique to estimate the customer&#8217;s unobservable states. Through simulations based on public datasets, our proposed Greedy-MLE and CUCB-MLE policies for dispatch decision-making outperform existing methods in relative power adjustment mismatch, collective fatigue, and cumulative regret. The simulation results highlight the benefits of the proposed RDER dispatch approach in ensuring customer satisfaction, service quality, and economic efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Robust Coordinated Planning of Multi-Region Integrated Energy Systems With Categorized Demand Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10606443</link><description>In this paper, categorized demand response (DR) programs are proposed to address the coordinated planning problem in multi-region integrated energy systems (MRIESs).

Subsequently, the detailed DR model is leveraged to minimize the operation cost and gas emissions in a renewable-integrated MRIES considering the uncertainties from wind and solar power. Then, a flexible adjustable robust optimization (FARO) approach is presented to deal with all uncertainty sources. The FARO approach aims to ensure the safe operation of the MRIES against any uncertainty while meeting predefined performance objectives. Furthermore, a bi-level solution algorithm is designed by combining the stochastic dichotomy method and the column-and-constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) algorithm to solve our coordinated planning model. Finally, case studies are conducted on a practical MRIES in Changsha, China. Experimental results indicate the effectiveness of the categorized DR programs in adjusting allocable resources to maximize holistic system profits.

Conventional generation units are gradually replaced and may soon become inadequate to meet the frequency regulation (FR) requirements. Consequently, demand-side resources for FR have received increasing attention. Among demand-side sources, inverter air conditioners (IACs) have huge regulation capacity and account for nearly 40% of the total power consumption in summer, while energy storage systems (ESSs) excel in rapid response and powerful ramp rate. However, the inadequate ramp speed of IACs and the insufficient regulation capacity of ESSs render them incapable of providing FR independently. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a distributed coordinated control algorithm that allows the effective utilization of ESSs and IACs to provide FR considering the respective advantages. Firstly, an equivalent thermal energy storage model of IAC in alignment with ESS is introduced considering heterogeneous parameters. Subsequently, a coordinated control framework is proposed for heterogeneous ESSs (hetero-ESSs), which are composed of ESSs and IACs. Based on the framework, a distributed consensus algorithm is devised for hetero-ESSs, and its stability is demonstrated through the application of the Lyapunov theorem. Finally, numerical studies verify that the proposed framework can promote ESSs&#8217; short-term ability and IACs&#8217; long-term flexibility.</description></item><item><title>Alleviating the Curse of Dimensionality in Minkowski Sum Approximations of Storage Flexibility</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10576684</link><description>Many real-world applications require the joint optimization of a large number of flexible devices over time. The flexibility of, e.g., multiple batteries, thermostatically controlled loads, or electric vehicles can be used to support grid operation and to reduce operation costs. Using piecewise constant power values, the flexibility of each device over d time periods can be described as a polytopic subset in power space. The aggregated flexibility is given by the Minkowski sum of these polytopes. As the computation of Minkowski sums is in general demanding, several approximations have been proposed in the literature. Yet, their application potential is often objective-dependent and limited by the curse of dimensionality. We show that up to  $2^{d}$  vertices of each polytope can be computed efficiently and that the convex hull of their sums provides a computationally efficient inner approximation of the Minkowski sum. Via an extensive simulation study, we illustrate that our approach outperforms ten state-of-the-art inner approximations in terms of computational complexity and accuracy for different objectives. Moreover, we propose an efficient disaggregation method applicable to any vertex-based approximation. The proposed methods provide an efficient means to aggregate and to disaggregate energy storages in quarter-hourly periods over an entire day with reasonable accuracy for aggregated cost and for peak power optimization.</description></item><item><title>Continuous Approximate Dynamic Programming Algorithm to Promote Multiple Battery Energy Storage Lifespan Benefit in Real-Time Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586215</link><description>This paper aims to promote the lifespan benefit of multiple battery energy storage (BES) in real-time scheduling.

To alleviate the computation and communication burden on edge sides, centralized training &amp; decentralized execution (CTDE) based multi-agent reinforcement learning methods have been proposed. However, the performance of these methods relies heavily on the agents&#8217; coordination mechanism and accurate observations. Given access to a vast amount of distributed energy resources, it becomes increasingly challenging to achieve efficient coordination within CTDE framework. Furthermore, the agents&#8217; observations always involve perturbations such as measurement noises and even cyber-attacks in real-world ADNs, which can significantly degrade the distributed VVC performance and may cause severe security issues. In this paper, we propose an attention-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning method to address observation perturbations for distributed VVC.

Access to this granular metering data raises privacy concerns, hindering global adoption of the smart grid. Aggregation-based frameworks aim to address these concerns, but suffer from several limitations such as, a high computational overhead on smart meters, architectural complexity, and vulnerability to single points of compromise. Distributed aggregation-based frameworks show promise, but often assume an unrealistic semi-honest threat model, a lack of integrity verification capabilities for metering data, and dynamic billing (Time Of Use) capabilities. This paper introduces a distributed framework in a malicious setting that provides integrity verification of metering data while preserving customer privacy. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first attempt to include integrity verification capabilities of metering data and dynamic billing in a distributed data collection setting while considering a malicious adversary. A proof of concept demonstrates our proposed framework&#8217;s viability and performance against other frameworks. Our framework is shown to be lightweight on smart meters, resilient to cyberattacks, and more efficient, compared to competing techniques in the literature.</description></item><item><title>A Semi-Decentralized Real-Time Charging Scheduling Scheme for Large EV Parking Lots Considering Uncertain EV Arrival and Departure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10580944</link><description>Developing large commercial electric vehicle (EV) parking lots to support the rapid EV adoption arouses interest in optimizing their real-time charging schedules with enhanced economic efficiency. This problem has been studied in literature via fully centralized or decentralized schemes, i.e., EV charging schedules are solely determined by the parking lot central operator or individual chargers, confronting the dilemma of scalability and parking-lot-wise economic optimality. This paper studies a semi-decentralized real-time charging scheduling scheme, in which the central operator and individual chargers collaborate to achieve optimal EV charging schedules. Specifically, the central operator uses a chance-constrained model to estimate aggregate charging energy needs in a rolling process at a coarse time granularity, while considering uncertainties of aggregate arrival and departure EV charging demands via a Gaussian mixture model; with the estimated aggregate charging energy, the central operator further calculates charging energy references of individual chargers regarding their distinct charging urgency and discharging availability; each charger finally determines the actual charging power by leveraging the charging dynamics, EV departure uncertainty scenarios, and charging energy reference at a fine time granularity. The economics and efficiency of the proposed scheme are evaluated by comparing it to various forms of fully centralized schemes via numerical simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme, with proper settings on the charging urgency factor, time granularity, and discount factor, significantly enhances efficiency in the minute-wise charging scheduling of large-scale EVs at the slight cost of compromised revenue.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Method for Estimating Inertia of a PV-Integrated Power Grid for Enhanced Security</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10592076</link><description>The decommissioning of traditional thermal power plants with high levels of renewable energy resources (RES) always causes a reduction in system inertia. A hybrid power grid must maintain stable frequency during severe disturbances. Therefore, this study provides a generalized approach for estimating the online grid inertia under normal and disturbed operating conditions. Large-scale deployment of photovoltaic (PV) power generation is considered to replicate the rapid growth of RES and its impact on actual power grids. The individual inertia of existing conventional synchronous generators in the hybrid system is quickly estimated using the online recursive least square (RLS) method. A Kalman filter is used to reject any noise contained in the measured signals. The noise-free rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) and electrical power are further used to refine the estimation of inertia, damping coefficient, and mechanical power to enhance the overall accuracy of the proposed tracking scheme. Next, the virtual inertia of the existing PV system is derived mathematically from the identified model parameters, which are further verified using simulation results, thereby demonstrating the robustness of the proposed approach. Finally, the spectral cluster-based method is used to determine the sets of coherent machines and provide online tracking for each coherent group&#8217;s inertia, as well as the total grid inertia in response to different disturbances and intermittency of RES power generation. The proposed inertia estimation method is proven to be very fast, allowing preventative action to be taken before any instability occurs.The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested and verified using IEEE 39-bus, 68-bus, an islanded AC microgrid, as well as a modified IEEE 39-bus based MTDC test system.</description></item><item><title>Peer-to-Peer Energy Transactions for Prosumers Based on Improved Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571970</link><description>With the evolution of the power market, the active involvement of prosumers in both consuming renewable energy and maximizing financial gains has emerged as a pivotal and compelling trend in the prospective landscape of energy market development. However, the optimal energy trading strategy for prosumers under a complicated peer-to-peer (P2P) market environment is still a great challenge, due to the incomplete information and large decision space. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an improved deep deterministic policy gradient (IDDPG) algorithm to optimize the P2P energy trading and operation strategy for prosumers. The proposed IDDPG algorithm uses a wave-attention network to model the external interactive environment of each prosumer to simplify the complexity of multi-agent trading environment. Moreover, a priority sampling mechanism is proposed to learn valuable experiences purposefully and adopts a cyclic learning rate to avoid local optimality. Finally, the feasibility of the method is verified by the case study of P2P trading with different scales of prosumers. The numerical results show that the proposed IDDPG algorithm outperforms the traditional reinforcement learning algorithms in both calculating efficiency and convergence, and provides a reference for the P2P transaction strategy of prosumers.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic and Static Combined State Recovery Method Against FDI Attacks in Power Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10564142</link><description>The widespread integration of information technology into power systems increases their vulnerability to false data injection (FDI) attacks, where attackers can mislead the power system state estimator to produce incorrect results. Consequently, it is critical to identify the attack and recover the real system state of the power grid. The primary method of state recovery is to derive the real state from measurements covered by the static measurement protection (SMP) methods, which are expensive to apply. The dynamic reactance perturbation (DRP) methods are low-cost but may fail in some conditions to detect attacks due to the topology limitation. In this paper, we propose a dynamic and static combined defense (DSCD) method, which combines the DRP and SMP methods to identify attacks and enhance the resilience of the state estimator at a lower cost. First, we propose the framework of DSCD and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for recovering the system state. Second, we develop a non-convex optimization model to implement DSCD and propose heuristic algorithms under two extreme scenarios. Using these algorithms, defenders have the flexibility to balance between cost and delay. Simulation results on four IEEE test systems validated the superior performance of the proposed DSCD method.</description></item><item><title>Barrier-Function Adaptive Finite-Time Trajectory Tracking Controls for Cyber Resilience in Smart Grids Under an Electricity Market Environment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566851</link><description>The advancement and proliferation of digitalization and communication infrastructure have facilitated the rise of real-time bidding markets in smart grids. In these dynamic markets, energy distribution companies and power-generating companies interact to establish energy exchange contracts based on offered prices. However, the fluctuation in power flow resulting from contract changes within the real-time bidding market introduces a potential vulnerability that malicious attackers can exploit to launch successful stealthy attacks. To enhance the smart grid resiliency against cyber-attack in the power market bidding environment, a new barrier-function adaptive finite-time trajectory tracking control is proposed in this paper. The developed controller is utilized to actively counteract and mitigate potential cyber-attacks to ensure their rejection and prevention. The stability analysis convincingly demonstrates the rapid convergence of system states within a finite time frame, empowering the system to effectively reject cyber-attacks in real-time. Test results of an IEEE test systems, considering governor dead bound nonlinearity and communication time delay are presented and compared with those obtained from other methods to ensure and demonstrate the performance of proposed method. The Speedgoat real-time target machine, along with Simulink real-time, validates the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Blockchain-Based Authentication Scheme for Energy Trading in Electric Transportation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10580954</link><description>Authentication between Electric Vehicle (EV) users and Battery Charging/Switching (BCS) stations is a significant problem for energy trading. Although there are many existing authentication schemes, cross-domain authentication for EV users and BCS stations from different domains (such as different regions, companies, manufacturers) has not been well addressed; several blockchain-based cross-domain authentication schemes have more than 11 times communication rounds and involve over 4 times exponentiation, scalar multiplications and bilinear pairing cryptographic operations; this leads to high communication and computational costs. This work aims to tackle this problem by using blockchain and certificate-based public-key cryptography. It proposes an authentication scheme that uses a blockchain ledger to record authentication materials across different domains. A two-stage smart contract is designed and deployed to verify the authentication materials before storing them permanently in the blockchain. A novel certificate-based authenticated key establishment (CB-AKE) protocol is proposed to authenticate EV users and BCS stations. Based on the theoretical analysis and practical evaluation on the security and performance, the proposed scheme can well address the cross-domain authentication problem with acceptable cost. Compared to benchmark schemes, the authentication latency of CB-AKE is decreased by at least 25% and the throughput of CB-AKE is increased by at least 34%.</description></item><item><title>Data-Enabled Modeling and PMU-Based Real-Time Localization of EV-Based Load-Altering Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586268</link><description>Recently, the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) and their associated electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) has increased significantly in smart grids. Due to the cyber vulnerabilities of this EV ecosystem, such integration makes the entire grid prone to cyberattacks, which can result in the outage of generators or even blackouts. On this basis, this paper leverages a data-enabled predictive attack model (DeeP-AM) to design an EV-based dynamic load-altering attack (EV-DLAA) that targets the frequency stability of the grid. Subsequently, a robust localization framework for the developed EV-DLAAs is proposed using power system measurements obtained from phasor measurement units (PMUs). First, frequency measurements in the transmission grid are used to develop an optimal EV-DLAA without having perfect knowledge of the grid&#8217;s topology. Such an optimal attack model ensures that the targeted frequency deviation is reached by utilizing the least number of EVs and a minimized time of instability (ToI). Then, a PMU-based real-time localization framework is developed based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method, which simultaneously estimates the magnitude and location of EV-DLAAs. The equations obtained from the SINDy method are effectively solved using a modified basis pursuit de-noising (MBPDN) approach. This approach enhances the accuracy and robustness of the localization framework, particularly when confronted with noise. The attack implications and the localization performance are evaluated using the New England 39-bus and Australian power systems.</description></item><item><title>Anomaly Observer-Based Cyber-Resilient Torque Control Against Hybrid Attacks in Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599829</link><description>Inspired by the continued focuses on renewable energy cybersecurity issues, this paper aims to propose a cyber-resilient torque control framework for wind turbines to defend against the hybrid attack. The cyber threat model is established combining denial-of-service and data manipulation attacks, which attempts to destabilize the wind turbine system by implementing the attacks on the communication link from the rotor speed sensor to the controller. Particularly, the impact of hybrid attack is analyzed and classified into two cases, and the corresponding compensatory measures are developed. To mitigate the impact of the hybrid attack and stabilize the wind turbine system, a cyber-resilient torque control scheme combining zero-order holder and anomaly observer is proposed, which requires simple computational ability of the wind turbine system. Using the Lyapunov theory, the control target of optimal rotor speed tracking is guaranteed and the tolerable attack range under the proposed method is derived. Extensive studies are carried out on a 1.5 MW doubly-fed induction generator-based wind turbine, and the simulation results indicate that the proposed control strategy could effectively reduce the impacts caused by the hybrid attack.</description></item><item><title>PAP: A Privacy-Preserving Authentication Scheme With Anonymous Payment for V2G Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10613000</link><description>Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) networks, as an emerging smart grid paradigm, can be integrated with renewable energy resources to provide power services and manage electricity demands. When accessing electricity services, an electric vehicle  $\left ({{\mathcal {E}\mathcal {V}}}\right)$  typically provides authentication or/and payment information containing identifying data to a service provider, which raises privacy concerns as malicious entities might trace  $\mathcal {E}\mathcal {V}$  activity or exploit personal information. Although numerous anonymous authentication and payment schemes have been presented for V2G networks, no such privacy-preserving scheme supports authentication and payment simultaneously. Therefore, this paper is the first to present a privacy-preserving authentication scheme with anonymous payment for V2G networks (PAP, for short). In addition, this scheme also supports accountability and revocability, which are practical features to prevent malicious behavior; minimal attribute disclosure, which maximizes the privacy of  $\mathcal {E}\mathcal {V}$  when responding to the service provider&#8217;s flexible access policies; payment binding, which guarantees the accountability in the payment phase; user-controlled linkability, which enables  $\mathcal {E}\mathcal {V}$  to decide whether different authentication sessions are linkable for continuous services. On the performance side, we implement PAP with the pairing cryptography library, then evaluate it on different hardware platforms, showing that it is essential for V2G applications.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Blockchain-Based Data Aggregation Scheme With Privacy-Preserving on the Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10612996</link><description>With the development of smart grid, the introduction of blockchain technology provides a novel idea for secure power data sharing. The existing blockchain-based data aggregation schemes generally rely on a unique leader node to perform verification algorithms, but there may be a lazy leader node not performing aggregation data verification to save computation costs. In addition, in the existing verification mechanism, light nodes need to perform the same verification operations as the leader node, which results in resource-constrained light nodes being unable to bear. In this paper, we propose an efficient blockchain-based data aggregation scheme with privacy-preserving on the smart grid, called EC-ASPG, which implements a supervised mechanism for the lazy leader node, enhancing the security of the system. Furthermore, we propose a separable consensus verification mechanism, which can prevent other light nodes from performing duplicate verification operations like the leader node, effectively improving the efficiency of consensus verification. Finally, we present a formal security proof and comprehensive performance evaluations. The results show that our scheme is secure and outperforms the compared schemes in terms of performance analysis.</description></item><item><title>LLRA: A Lightweight Leakage-Resilient Authentication Key Exchange Scheme for Smart Meters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623401</link><description>The authentication between smart meters and Neighbourhood Area Communication Network (NAN) gateways is a critical issue due to various types of side channel attacks. To address this, a new protocol called Lightweight Leakage-Resilient Authentication Key Exchange (LLRA) was proposed for smart meters. LLRA incorporates continuous after-the-fact leakage-resilient property. Furthermore, extended BPR (CLR-eBPR) security model and extended GNY (CLR-eGNY) logic were introduced. Through provable security analysis, logic analysis, and practical performance evaluations, we demonstrated that LLRA effectively mitigates side-channel attacks while maintaining minimum authentication delay and energy consumption for the computing devices used in smart meters and NAN gateways. Compared to benchmark protocols, the authentication delay of LLRA was decreased by at least 14%; in addition, the energy consumption of LLRA was decreased by at least 7%.</description></item><item><title>Detection of Malicious Command Injection Attacks Against Static Var Compensators in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643841</link><description>In a smart grid, voltage control and reactive power control are crucial to its safe and reliable operation. Static Var compensators (SVCs) are widely used to achieve these controls in a transmission system, either through centralized control by Energy Management Systems or through local closed loop control systems. In smart grids, the command channels to control SVCs are vulnerable to cyber attacks. In this paper, attack scenarios involving injection of malicious commands to SVCs are studied in detail. Attack models are established for both methods of control. Based on these attack models, two detection algorithms are proposed. The principle behind these algorithms involves the notion that even though an adversary can manipulate the commands and measurements related to SVCs, it is nearly impossible to hide the effect on other state variables and measurements in the system. The algorithms are developed mathematically using electrical quantities, making these schemes independent of the underlying Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) used. The rationale behind the choices made during the development of the algorithms are proven formally. Finally, two algorithms are formally proposed, which are easy to implement and computationally less intensive, when compared to iterative and multi-stage algorithms. These algorithms are then tested on various test-cases on the IEEE 118-bus system and found to be effective.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Optimal Power Flow for Multi-Agent Active Distribution Networks: A Differentially Private Consensus ADMM Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659236</link><description>In multi-agent active distribution networks, the information exchanges in the ADMM algorithm for the decentralized distribution-level optimal power flow (D-OPF) may expose sensitive load flows of tie-lines across adjacent agents. This may be overheard by adversarial agents for business competition. To preserve this privacy, this paper proposes a differentially private consensus ADMM (DP-C-ADMM) algorithm, which can offer a mixture solution of both realistically optimal generator outputs and obfuscated-but-feasible load flows of tie-lines. And  $\epsilon -$ differential privacy holds for load flows of tie-lines across agents over iterations. Case study justifies the theoretical properties of this algorithm up to specified privacy parameters.</description></item><item><title>Time-Domain Channel Measurements and Small-Scale Fading Characterization for RIS-Assisted Wireless Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552411</link><description>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have attracted extensive attention from industry and academia. In RIS-assisted wireless communication systems, practical channel measurements and modeling serve as the foundation for system design, network optimization, and performance evaluation. In this paper, a RIS time-domain channel measurement system, based on a software defined radio platform, is developed for the first time to investigate the small-scale fading characteristics of RIS-assisted channels. We present RIS channel measurements in corridor and laboratory scenarios and compare the power delay profile of the channel without RIS, with RIS specular reflection, and with RIS intelligent reflection. The multipath component parameters and cluster parameters based on the Saleh-Valenzuela model are extracted. We find that the power delay profiles (PDPs) of the RIS-assisted channel fit the power-law decay model better than the common exponential decay model and approximate the law of square decay. Through intelligent reflection, the RIS can decrease the delay and concentrate the energy of the virtual line-of-sight (VLoS) path, thereby reducing the delay spread and mitigating multipath fading. Furthermore, the cluster characteristics of RIS-assisted channels are highly dependent on the measurement environment. In the laboratory scenario, a single cluster dominated by the VLoS path with smooth envelope is observed. On the other hand, in the corridor scenario, some additional clusters introduced by the RIS reflection are created.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Joint Design of THz-Enabled UAV Trajectory and Channel Allocation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552119</link><description>6G is anticipated to play a foundational role in realizing various emerging entertainment applications and critical societal services, such as smart agriculture, public safety, and so on. Providing the underlying communications for these applications will substantially increase demand for data rate, reliability, and resiliency. Given these requirements, Terahertz (THz)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to support the essential functions within the future 6G networks. Meanwhile, due to the dynamic environment in a THz-enabled UAV-assisted network with multiple UAVs, using model-free multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) becomes a promising approach to optimize scarce resources. However, satisfying cooperative safety constraints is not guaranteed in most previous MADRL techniques. Consequently, this paper aims to address the cooperative safety guarantee challenge in the joint design problem of UAV trajectory and channel allocation in a THz-enabled UAV-assisted network. Specifically, the goal of the proposed scheme is to maximize energy efficiency, considering the quality of service of each IoT device, the speed limitation of UAVs, and the collision avoidance constraint between UAVs. The problem is mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINP), known as NP-hard to solve. Thus, we propose a novel distributed safe MADRL (DSMADRL) approach for the safe trajectory design of UAVs using a data-driven uniformly ultimate boundedness stability method. Moreover, we theoretically show that the DSMADRL approach guarantees satisfying the cooperative safety constraint of collision avoidance between UAVs as well as maximizing energy efficiency. Furthermore, the matching method is used to allocate THz sub-bands distributively. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithms is evaluated by comparing them with the existing multi-agent RL algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid-Driven Motion Planning for a Bionic Underwater Vehicle With Gliding Ability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552400</link><description>This study explores an efficient hybrid-driven motion planning method for a bionic underwater vehicle equipped with gliding capabilities, aimed at enhancing the efficiency of autonomous docking while ensuring reliable visual navigation. To achieve this, we first construct and analyze an energy-time consumption model along with a visual navigation stability parameter. These frameworks assess the total energy and time expended, as well as the likelihood of target loss during visual navigation. We then develop a hybrid-driven switching scheme that alternates between two motion modes to approach and dock with a stationary target. A novel motion planning method, based on the deep Q network (DQN) algorithm, is proposed to identify the optimal switching points within this scheme. This method aims to minimize energy and time consumption while maintaining visual navigation stability. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated through both simulation and controlled pool experiments. Results indicate that this hybrid-driven approach not only stabilizes visual navigation but also improves the efficiency of autonomous docking when compared to single-mode strategies. This research contributes to the advancement of hybrid-driven autonomous vehicles and offers new perspectives on the motion planning and control of underwater vehicles with gliding capabilities.</description></item><item><title>Cloud-Edge Collaborative Submap-Based VSLAM Using Implicit Representation Transmission</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10553304</link><description>Applying VSLAM to mobile robots with limited computing power is the key to achieving autonomous navigation, and the cloud-edge collaborative VSLAM is a solution. However, the VSLAM data transmission in the working site with limited communication is still an open problem. To solve this problem, two core issues should be considered: the transmission frequency and the transmission data volume. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous submap building framework to reduce the transmission frequency. Also, we design an implicit representation-based transmission method to save the transmission data volume while satisfying the data association between the edge and the cloud. Through the experiments, our method shows advanced performance in terms of communication demand with low transmission frequency and small data volume. At the same time, comparable precision to the state-of-the-art is achieved, showing the effectiveness of the data association building. Thanks to the reduced transmission frequency and data volume, our system provides a feasible way to the cloud-based VSLAM under limited communication.</description></item><item><title>Secure Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication in UAV-Enabled NOMA Wireless Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561528</link><description>Combing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in ultra-reliable and low latency communication (uRLLC) is deemed as a new service category of 5G wireless networks. The openness nature of wireless environment makes security of information transmission unprecedentedly importance. Traditional cryptography methods cannot cater to uRLLC due to high complex design and processing delay. As a result, physical layer security (PLS) has been designed to secure information transmission by exploiting intrinsic property of wireless channel. However, many prior works ignored the role of UAV in study of PLS in uRLLC, and mobility of UAV deserves further investigation. This paper studies security and reliability performances of UAV-based uRLLC by using NOMA, where two kinds of users with different requirements are served, i.e., users with privacy and low latency requirement (PLR), and users with reliability and low latency requirement (RLR). With the tools of stochastic geometry, we formulate the secrecy rate, a popular metric in study of PLS, by establishing the closed-form expressions for static and dynamic UAV. Key system parameters (e.g., transmit power allocation) are optimized for secrecy rate maximization. Simulations evaluate theoretical analysis and give a significant insight into a positive secrecy rate for the network designer.</description></item><item><title>Energy Efficiency Maximization for Downlink NOMA Designs via Symbol-Level Precoding</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568396</link><description>The multi-antenna non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique is a promising method to enhance energy and spectrum efficiencies of wireless communication systems through advanced precoding algorithms. However, conventional NOMA schemes encounter high complexity issues due to the successive interference cancellation (SIC) process at the receiver end. Moreover, traditional precoding designs for multi-antenna NOMA systems only utilize user channel state information and overlook the modulation details of transmitted data symbols, which may result in suboptimal performance. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a symbol-level precoding (SLP) scheme to maximize the energy efficiency of the downlink NOMA systems. In particular, by the proposed SLP scheme, the &#8220;interference signals&#8221; is designed to fall within the decoding region of the &#8220;desired signal&#8221;, eliminating the need for an SIC receiver, thereby reducing the complexity of the NOMA system in practical applications. For ease of illustrating the idea of the SLP-based NOMA designs, we first focus on a single user group case with two users, and solve the associated problem by developing a fractional programming-based algorithm. Then, we extend the idea to the multi-user scenarios and focus on the joint user grouping and SLP design. For the purpose of computational complexity reduction, a low-complexity (adaptive) user grouping scheme is proposed based on the idea of unsupervised clustering. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed SLP scheme and algorithms in improving the energy efficiency of the system.</description></item><item><title>Joint MIMO Transceiver and Reflector Design for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10553296</link><description>In this paper, we consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output communication system with multiple antennas at both the base station (BS) and the user. We plan to maximize the achievable rate through jointly optimizing the transmit precoding matrix, the receive combining matrix, and the RIS reflection matrix under the constraints of the transmit power at the BS and the unit-modulus reflection at the RIS. Regarding the non-trivial problem form, we initially reformulate it into an considerable problem to make it tractable by utilizing the relationship between the achievable rate and the weighted minimum mean squared error. Next, the transmit precoding matrix, the receive combining matrix, and the RIS reflection matrix are alternately optimized. In particular, the optimal transmit precoding matrix and receive combining matrix are obtained in closed forms. Furthermore, a pair of computationally efficient methods are proposed for the RIS reflection matrix, namely the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) method and the successive closed form (SCF) method. We theoretically prove that both methods are ensured to converge, and the SCF-based algorithm is able to converges to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point of the problem.</description></item><item><title>Interference-Based and Deep-Learning-Aided Physical Layer Security Enhancement in Uplink NOMA Under Cooperative Eavesdropping</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552432</link><description>Physical Layer Security (PLS) for Uplink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (UL-NOMA) is investigated, under cooperative multi-eavesdropping. Particular attention is paid to the effect that Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) decoding order has over the system secrecy rate. Each NOMA user is subject to an individual minimum bit rate requirement, whereas multiple eavesdroppers cooperate among themselves to enhance their repercussion on the system. We demonstrate the impact SIC decoding order has on the secrecy performance, and the importance to look for an optimal solution to the decoding order selection problem. We show how this problem is indeed a very challenging combinatorial one with a factorial complexity related to the number of users and eavesdroppers involved in the system. Given the high computational power demand to find the optimal solution, we approach the challenge in two ways. First, we propose a near-optimal interference-based analytical approach to find a secure decoding order. The idea is to take advantage of the inherent NOMA characteristic of self-interfere other legitimate users, to also act as an interference source over the eavesdroppers. Secondly, we introduce deep learning as another option to achieve a near-optimal solution with a much lower complexity. We see how a deep neural network is able to improve the performance of the interference-based analytical solution, being robuster to users' and eavesdroppers' increment. Finally, we demonstrate the accuracy of the two proposed solutions through numerical simulations and highlight their importance and advantages.</description></item><item><title>A Dual Mode Multi-Beam and Integrated CPM-LFM Signal for Dual-Functional Radar Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10553227</link><description>Dual-functional radar communication (DFRC) is extremely attractive in the sixth generation systems, since it can simultaneously support communication and detection by a unified hardware platform with real-time cooperation. Considering the appealing features of multiple beams, this paper designs a dual mode multi-beam scheme composed of static and dynamic beams, so that it can simultaneously support multi-user transmission and high-accuracy targets detection. Besides, an integrated continuous phase modulation and linear frequency modulation signal is exploited to improve both range resolution of radar and bit error rate (BER) of users. To unify communication and radar systems, we define radar rate, and set the maximum sum-rate composed of communication and radar rates as the objective function. Since the optimization problem is non-convex, the problem is divided into two sub-issues, i.e., user selection, and joint beamforming design with power allocation. A successive maximum rate algorithm is presented for the former one, which can balance the performances between the sum-rate and complexity; and maximum minimization - Lagrange multiplier iteration algorithm is utilized to solve the latter one. In addition, some theoretical analyses, e.g., spectrum, BER, ambiguity function, false alarm and detection probabilities are deduced for the proposed system. Simulation results show that our proposed DFRC system can provide better sum-rate than the classical communication and radar separated systems.</description></item><item><title>Joint 3D User and 6D Hybrid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Localization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10557771</link><description>The latest assessments of the emerging technologies for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have indicated the concept's significant potential for localization and sensing, either as individual or simultaneously realized tasks. However, in the vast majority of those studies, the RIS state (i.e., its position and rotation angles) is required to be known a priori. In this paper, we address the problem of the joint three-dimensional (3D) localization of a hybrid RIS (HRIS) and a user. The most cost- and power-efficient hybrid version of an RIS is equipped with a single reception radio-frequency chain and meta-atoms capable of simultaneous reconfigurable reflection and sensing. This dual functionality is controlled by adjustable power splitters embedded at each hybrid meta-atom. Focusing on a downlink scenario where a multi-antenna base station transmits multi-carrier signals to a user via an HRIS, we propose a multi-stage approach to jointly estimate the metasurface's 3D position and 3D rotation matrix (i.e., 6D parameter estimation) as well as the user's 3D position. Our simulation results verify the validity of the proposed estimator via extensive comparisons of the root-mean-square error of the state estimations with the Cram&#233;r-Rao lower bound (CRB), which is analytically derived. Furthermore, it is showcased that there exists an optimal hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (HRIS) power splitting ratio for the desired multi-parameter estimation problem. We also study the robustness of the proposed method in the presence of scattering points in the wireless propagation environment.</description></item><item><title>Collaborative Task Offloading Optimization for Satellite Mobile Edge Computing Using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596043</link><description>Satellite mobile edge computing (SMEC) achieves efficient processing for space missions by deploying computing servers on low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, which supplements a strong computing service for future satellite-terrestrial integrated networks. However, considering the spatio-temporal constraints on large-scale LEO networks, inter-satellite cooperative computing is still challenging. In this paper, a multi-agent collaborative task offloading scheme for distributed SMEC is proposed. Facing the time-varying available satellites and service requirements, each autonomous satellite agent dynamically adjusts offloading decisions and resource allocations based on local observations. Furthermore, for evaluating the behavioral contribution of an agent to task completion, we adopt a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on counterfactual multi-agent policy gradients (COMA) to optimize the strategy, which enables energy-efficient decisions satisfying the time and resource restrictions of SMEC. An actor-critic (AC) framework is effectively exploited to separately implement centralized training and distributed execution (CTDE) of the algorithm. We also redesign the actor structure by introducing an attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory network (Atten-BiLSTM) to explore the temporal characteristics of LEO networks. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively enable satellite autonomous collaborative computing in the distributed SMEC environment, and outperforms the benchmark algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Cross-User Dependent Task Offloading and Resource Allocation in Spatial-Temporal Dynamic MEC Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555001</link><description>The emergence of mobile edge computing (MEC) technology opens up new opportunities for the realization of demanding applications proximate to the user. This work aims to capitalize on the constrained resources of MEC networks to efficiently fulfill service requests by jointly optimizing task offloading and resource allocation. However, the growing complexity of applications such as intelligent transportation and autonomous driving introduces new challenges in modeling and problem-solving due to the causal correlation of service logic among various users, which adds to the intricate spatial-temporal dynamics of the network. To effectively capture the essence of cross-user task dependency in these scenarios while also accommodating dynamic factors like the variability of wireless channels and the mobility of terminals, we formulate a spatial-temporal correlative problem, aiming to minimize the weighted cost of task completion delay and energy consumption. To resolve this problem, a Double Deep Q Network (DDQN) is developed for task offloading while integrating subchannel allocation and transmit power control into it to interact with the dynamic environment to generate a reward signal, thereby optimizing the long-term performance of the system. Comprehensive simulations verify that the proposed algorithm surpasses the comparative methods in reducing the cost. Additionally, adaptability in different scenarios with different parameters and task structures has also been validated and analyzed.</description></item><item><title>Leveraging Acoustic AoA to Enhance mmWave Beam Search-Based Blockage Prediction: An Experimental Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10553393</link><description>This paper proposes a novel device-free sensing framework, integrative heterogeneous wave sensing (IHWS). IHWS leverages mmWave angular power profile obtained through beam search and acoustic waves to facilitate wireless sensing focused primarily on blockage prediction in the realm of 6G communication networks. For reliable mmWave communication in realistic environments, mmWave can also serve as a sensing tool for identifying the direction of moving obstacles, such as vehicles, which could potentially cause link blockage. However, the effectiveness of mmWave device-free sensing is initially constrained by the requirement that the target at least has line-of-sight (LOS) to both the base station and user equipment. To mitigate this constraint, we propose an IHWS framework that utilizes motion-induced sound to capture the movement of obstacles and determine their angle of arrival (AoA), thereby enhancing the capabilities of mmWave sensing techniques. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that it is possible to achieve directional localization of the target even outside the LOS region of user equipment and to predict the received power. Moreover, it is confirmed that the directional localization accuracy improves by around 24%, specially when the LOS between the target and user equipment is not necessarily guaranteed.</description></item><item><title>Link Topology and Multi-Objective Mission Flow Optimization for Remote Sensing Satellites With Inter-Layer Links and Satellite-Ground Links</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10557755</link><description>In the future Space Information Network (SIN), remote sensing satellites (RSSs) can access communication constellations (CCs) and ground stations (GSs) through inter-layer links (ILLs) and satellite-ground links (SGLs) to realize the timely transmission of large amounts of observation data. In this paper, we study the link topology of both ILLs and SGLs with different time slot durations from the perspective of each RSS based on the time-expanded graph. We propose a multi-objective mission flow optimization model to jointly achieve transmission benefits maximization, end-of-period energy maximization, and transmission wait time minimization. This model considers missions' importance differences under limited storage, energy, and link bandwidth resources. To reduce the solving complexity and solution time, we propose a Phased Multi-Objective (PMO) algorithm to solve this problem. We simulate the proposed methods in different scale SIN with practical parameters. The results show that RSS's entire orbital period can be covered by ILLs and SGLs, except for the ILLs' handover time. When the ILLs' data transmission rate is much less than the RSSs' data acquisition rate, important mission data can be transmitted in priority. When the transmission rate approaches the data acquisition rate, all observation data can be transmitted in near real-time. The proposed PMO algorithm can obtain the optimal solution in 19.1 seconds for a constellation with 500 satellites, which is much less than the 3.8-minute solution time used by other existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Superposed IM-OFDM (S-IM-OFDM): An Enhanced OFDM for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559944</link><description>Integratedsensing and communications (ISAC) is a critical enabler for emerging 6G applications, and at its core lies in the dual-functional waveform design. While orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been a popular basic waveform, its primitive version falls short in sensing due to the inherent unregulated auto-correlation properties. Furthermore, the sensitivity to Doppler shift hinders its broader applications in dynamic scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a superposed index-modulated OFDM (S-IM-OFDM). The proposed scheme improves the sensing performance without excess power consumption by translating the energy efficiency of IM-OFDM onto sensing-oriented signals over OFDM. Also, it maintains excellent communication performance in time-varying channels by leveraging the sensed parameters to compensate for Doppler. Compared to conventional OFDM, the proposed S-IM-OFDM waveform exhibits better sensing capabilities and wider applicability in dynamic scenarios. Both theoretical analyses and simulations corroborate its dual benefits.</description></item><item><title>Secure Rate Maximization for ISAC-UAV Assisted Communication Amidst Multiple Eavesdroppers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566041</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology have been employed in the field of communication. In this paper, we propose an ISAC-UAV assisted secure communication system amidst multiple eavesdroppers. In each time slot, we implement ISAC and communication functions. Since there are multiple eavesdroppers in the system, jammer UAV is required to send jamming signals to the eavesdroppers. During the ISAC process, the source UAV identifies multiple eavesdroppers, relaying their position information to a jammer UAV. During the communication process, multiple eavesdroppers attempt to intercept the communication link between source UAV and users. We use the center of all users as the horizontal location of the jammer UAV. To maximize the secure data transmit rate, we propose a joint optimization problem involving user scheduling, transmit power, and source UAV trajectory. We break down the non-convex optimization problem into three subproblems, and then achieve the suboptimal solution to the original problem through iteratively optimizing these subproblems. Simulation results indicate that the proposed solution can achieve significant secure transmit rate even in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers.</description></item><item><title>Performance Analysis of IRS Assisted Full-Duplex Systems With Different Downlink and Uplink Users</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10584312</link><description>In this work, we investigate a full-duplex network assisted by an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) involving both downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users in the same frequency band with best user selection.

We also investigate the joint allocation of element splitting between the zones, user power allocations, and reflection amplitude with SOP minimization and ergodic sum rate maximization as objectives. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted to validate the analytical expressions.</description></item><item><title>On Performance of Backscatter-NOMA Systems: Symbiotic Communication for IoT Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568552</link><description>Backscatter communication and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are emerging paradigms in wireless communication offering promising solutions to enhance spectral and energy efficiency of energy-constrained devices in 6G networks. This work introduces a symbiotic radio system tailored for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and proposes an innovative framework that integrates backscatter-based IoT devices into the NOMA network. In this proposed system, the primary base station employs NOMA principles to serve both far and near users simultaneously. The IoT network consists of an IoT device equipped with a backscattering device that transmits its information over the primary signal, fostering a symbiotic relationship between the two. The IoT transmitter not only serves the IoT receiver but also concurrently enhances performance of the far user. This paper delves into an extensive analysis of the outage probabilities for the NOMA and IoT networks. The outage probability of the far user is obtained for the cases with and without a direct link between the primary base station and the far user. The obtained results clearly demonstrate a significant performance improvement over orthogonal multiple access techniques. Finally, we employ Monte Carlo simulations to validate the accuracy of the derived theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Quality of Experience Optimization for Real-Time XR Video Transmission With Energy Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589538</link><description>Extended Reality (XR) is an important service in the 5G network and in future 6G networks. In contrast to traditional video on demand services, real-time XR video is transmitted frame-by-frame, requiring low latency and being highly sensitive to network fluctuations. In this paper, we model the quality of experience (QoE) for real-time XR video transmission on a frame-by-frame basis. Based on the proposed QoE model, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes QoE with constraints on wireless resources and long-term energy consumption. We utilize Lyapunov optimization to transform the original problem into a single-frame optimization problem and then allocate wireless subchannels. We propose an adaptive XR video bitrate algorithm that employs a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm for video bitrate selection. Through numerical results, we show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithms, with the average QoE improvements of 0.04 to 0.46. Specifically, compared to baseline algorithms, the proposed algorithm reduces average video quality variations by 29% to 50% and improves the frame transmission success rate by 5% to 48%.</description></item><item><title>Spectral Efficiency Maximization Oriented Joint Optimization for RIS-Aided mmWave IABN: An Alternating Iterative Optimization Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10598395</link><description>In this correspondence, we investigate the joint optimization for an uplink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter wave integrated access and backhaul network (mmWave IABN) to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE). When the bandwidth partition ratio between the access part and the backhaul part is given, the sum end-to-end rate maximized problem is firstly formulated and equivalently transformed as the SE maximization oriented joint optimization under the constraints including the users' transmission power and signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) requirement, and the RIS's unit mode. Secondly, an alternating iterative optimization approach is designed to obtain a nearly-optimal solution by solving the two subproblems (i.e., power control at the users and phase-shift manipulation at the RIS), which are decomposed from the original problem based on the successive convex approximation. Thirdly, the sum SE superiority of the proposed approach is demonstrated through the comparison with other baselines under different settings. In addition, the convergence of the proposed approach and the impact of the bandwidth partition ratio on the system performance are validated.</description></item><item><title>Interference Analysis for Coexistence of UAVs and Civil Aircrafts Based on Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10557637</link><description>Due to the advantages of high mobility and easy deployment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely applied in both military and civilian fields. In order to strengthen the flight surveillance of UAVs and guarantee the airspace safety, UAVs can be equipped with the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) system, which periodically sends flight information to other aircrafts and ground stations (GSs). However, due to the limited resource of channel capacity, UAVs equipped with ADS-B results in the interference between UAVs and civil aircrafts (CAs), which further impacts the accuracy of received information at GSs. In detail, the channel capacity is mainly affected by the density of aircrafts and the transmitting power of ADS-B. Hence, based on the three-dimensional poisson point process, this work leverages the stochastic geometry theory to build a model of the coexistence of UAVs and CAs and analyze the interference performance of ADS-B monitoring system. From simulation results, we reveal the effects of transmitting power, density, threshold and pathloss on the performance of the ADS-B monitoring system. Besides, we provide the suggested transmitting power and density for the safe coexistence of UAVs and CAs.</description></item><item><title>Cox Point Processes for Multi Altitude LEO Satellite Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10557592</link><description>To model existing or future low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks leveraging multiple constellations, we propose a simple analytical approach to represent the clustering of satellites on orbits. More precisely, we develop a variable-altitude Poisson orbit process that effectively captures the geometric fact that satellites are always positioned on orbits, and these orbits may vary in altitude. Conditionally on the orbit process, satellites situated on these orbits are modeled as linear Poisson point processes, thereby forming a Cox point process. For this model, we derive useful statistics, including the distribution of the distance from the typical user to its nearest visible satellite, the outage probability, the Laplace functional of the proposed Cox satellite point process, and the Laplace transform of the interference power from the Cox-distributed satellites under general fading. The derived statistics enable the evaluation of the performance of such LEO satellite communication systems as functions of network parameters.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Transistor-Based Dynamic Equivalent Circuit Modeling of Mesostructured-Based Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10676321</link><description>This study introduces a pioneering transistor-based equivalent circuit model explicitly tailored for mesostructured-based solar cells, primarily focusing on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

At the same time, the investigation extends to include the dynamic response of the cells through current&#8211;time analysis, as well as power losses. Notably, the response curve of the perovskite cell exhibits rapid escalation to peak current levels and displays heightened sensitivity to changes in illumination levels compared with DSSCs, with a response time of 1 ms for PSCs as opposed to 5 ms for DSSCs.</description></item><item><title>808 nm Laser Power Converters for Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10716003</link><description>808 nm ten-junction laser power converters (LPCs) with different areas were designed and grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition.

However, the data obtained mostly contains errors. Commercial I-V curve tracking units are generally expensive, hard to transport, slow to respond, and limited at low irradiations. This article proposes a novel I-V tracer (SEPIV) based on an optimized single-ended primary inductance converter. The SEPIV comprises a linear variable dc load connected to the solar panel's output. In this study, the experimental performance of the SEPIV was compared with the outcomes of commercial and lab devices, which are PVPM 1000 C 40 (PVPM) and WAVELABS SINUS-3000 PRO, respectively. SEPIV's accuracy matched lab units and surpassed PVPM's. As a highlight of this study, the introduced setup can capture the I-V curves of PV modules up to 650 W, a maximum VOC of 60 V, and a maximum ISC of 20 A. In contrast to commercial units, the SEPIV measurement does not depend on irradiation level. Moreover, it has the Internet of Things capability through a Wi-Fi connection for remote measurement.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Photovoltaic Power Prediction Based on CEEMDAN and Hybrid Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10670083</link><description>Accurate photovoltaic (PV) power prediction technology plays a crucial role in effectively addressing the challenges posed by the integration of large-scale PV systems into the grid. In this article, we propose a novel PV power combination prediction model based on complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) in conjunction with a hybrid neural network. To mitigate the influence of strong fluctuations in PV power on prediction outcomes, we employ CEEMDAN to decompose the PV data into several subsequences. Subsequently, sample entropy (SE) is used to quantify the complexity of each subsequence. Subsequences with similar SE values are then restructured to reduce computational load. Moreover, to overcome the limitations of a single neural network in capturing historical data features of PV power, a hybrid sequential convolutional neural network-gate recurrent unit (CNN-GRU) neural network is proposed. The effectiveness of our proposed model is validated through case studies involving PV power stations in two regions. To provide a comprehensive assessment, we conduct comparative validation by building and evaluating alternative models, including long-short term memory (LSTM), GRU, CEEMDAN-LSTM, CEEMDAN-GRU, and CNN-GRU. The results unequivocally demonstrate that the model presented in this article exhibits exceptional prediction performance, characterized by high accuracy and robust generalization.</description></item><item><title>Power-Efficient Analog Hardware Architecture of the Learning Vector Quantization Algorithm for Brain Tumor Classification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659713</link><description>This study introduces a design methodology pertaining to analog hardware architecture for the implementation of the learning vector quantization (LVQ) algorithm.

Due to the nonidealities of the calibration circuits, the calibrated bit weights carry errors. This error could propagate during the calibration procedure. Due to the high precision requirement of these ADCs, such residue error commonly becomes the signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) bottleneck of the overall ADC. This article presents an analysis of the residue error from bit weight self-calibration methods of high-resolution SAR ADCs. The major sources contributing to this error and the error reduction methods are quantitively analyzed. A statistical analysis of the noise-induced random error is developed. Our statistical model finds that the noise-induced random error follows the chi-square distribution. In practice, this random error is commonly reduced by repetitively measuring and averaging the calibrated bit weights. Our statistical model quantifies this bit weight error and leads to a clearer understanding of the error mechanism and design trade-offs. Following our chi-square model, the SNDR degradation due to the circuit noise during the calibration can be easily estimated without going through the time-consuming traditional transistor-level design and simulation process. The required repetition time can also be calculated. The bit-weight error models derived in this article are verified with measurement on a 16-bit SAR ADC design in a 180-nm CMOS process. Results from our model match both simulations and measurements well.</description></item><item><title>A nMOS-R Cross-Coupled Level Shifter With High dV/dt Noise Immunity for 600-V High-Voltage Gate Driver IC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596101</link><description>In digital integrated circuits with multiple power domains, level shifters (LSs) are essential circuit elements that can transform the voltage region from low to high. However, high-frequency gate drivers can generate hundreds of voltages per nanosecond noise (high dV/dt noise). Such high dV/dt noise can cause malfunction of a conventional pulse-triggered cross-coupled LS (CCLS) that is used to control the high-side nMOS switch. In this article, a novel LS with noise immunity is proposed and investigated. Compared with the conventional resistor load LS, the proposed circuit adopts nMOS-R cross-coupled (NRCC) LS, and realizes the selective filtering ability by exploiting the path that filters out the noise introduced by the dV/dt. The high-voltage gate drive integrated circuit (HVIC) is implemented using a 600 V silicon-on-insulator (SOI) BCD process. Analyses and experiments show that the proposed design can help the HVIC maintain a high common-mode transient immunity (CMTI) of up to 137 V/ns while allowing a negative VS swing down to -9.4 V under a 15 V supply voltage. Compared with the traditional HVIC with resistance load LS, the proposed novel HVIC with the NRCC LS improves the noise immunity of dV/dt by 182%.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Channel Interleaved ADC With Fast-Converging Foreground Time Calibration and Comparison-Based Control Logic</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669386</link><description>A dual-channel interleaved analog-to-digital converter (ADC) operating at 320 MS/s is prototyped to validate a fast-converging foreground time calibration algorithm that is independent of ADC offset errors. An input polarity switching technique is introduced to eliminate the impact of sub-ADC offset mismatches during foreground time calibration.

However, this method imposes a significant area and power/energy overhead. Also, the majority-based voter in the typical TMR designs is highly sensitive to soft errors and the design diversity of the triplicated module, which may result in an error for a small difference between the output of the TMR modules. However, a wide range of applications deployed in critical systems are inherently error-resilient, that is, they can tolerate some inexact results at their output while having a given level of reliability. In this article, we propose a high precision redundancy multiplier (HPR-Mul) that relies on the principles of approximate computing to achieve higher energy efficiency and lower area, as well as resolve the aforementioned challenges of the typical TMR schemes, while retaining the required level of reliability. The HPR-Mul is composed of full precision (FP) and two reduced precision (RP) multipliers, along with a simple voter to determine the output. Unlike the state-of-the-art RP redundancy multipliers (RPR-Muls) that require a complex voter, the voter of the proposed HPR-Mul is designed based on mathematical formulas resulting in a simpler structure. Furthermore, we use the intermediate signals of the FP multiplier as the inputs of the RP multipliers, which significantly enhance the accuracy of the HPR-Mul. The efficiency of the proposed HPR-Mul is evaluated in a 15-nm FinFET technology, where the results show up to 70% and 69% lower power consumption and area, respectively, compared to the typical TMR-based multipliers. Also, the HPR-Mul outperforms the state-of-the-art RPR-Mul by achieving up to 84% higher soft error tolerance. Moreover, by employing the HPR-Mul in different image processing applications, up to 13% higher output image quality is achieved in comparison with the state-of-the-art RPR multipliers.</description></item><item><title>MCAIMem: A Mixed SRAM and eDRAM Cell for Area and Energy-Efficient On-Chip AI Memory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684121</link><description>AI chips commonly employ SRAM memory as buffers for their reliability and speed, which contribute to high performance. However, SRAM is expensive and demands significant area and energy consumption. Previous studies have explored replacing SRAM with emerging technologies, such as nonvolatile memory, which offers fast read memory access and a small cell area. Despite these advantages, nonvolatile memory&#8217;s slow write memory access and high write energy consumption prevent it from surpassing SRAM performance in AI applications with extensive memory access requirements. Some research has also investigated embedded dynamic random access memory (eDRAM) as an area-efficient on-chip memory with similar access times as SRAM. Still, refresh power remains a concern, leaving the trade-off among performance, area, and power consumption unresolved. To address this issue, this article presents a novel mixed CMOS cell memory design that balances performance, area, and energy efficiency for AI memory by combining SRAM and eDRAM cells. We consider the proportion ratio of one SRAM and seven eDRAM cells in the memory to achieve area reduction using mixed CMOS cell memory. In addition, we capitalize on the characteristics of deep neural network (DNN) data representation and integrate asymmetric eDRAM cells to lower energy consumption. To validate our proposed MCAIMem solution, we conduct extensive simulations and benchmarking against traditional SRAM. Our results demonstrate that the MCAIMem significantly outperforms these alternatives in terms of area and energy efficiency. Specifically, our MCAIMem can reduce the area by 48% and energy consumption by  $3.4\times $  compared with SRAM designs, without incurring any accuracy loss.</description></item><item><title>A Novel TriNet Architecture for Enhanced Analog IC Design Automation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10672521</link><description>Analog integrated circuit (IC) design and its automation pose significant challenges due to the time-consuming mathematical computations and complexity of circuit design. Though efforts have been made to automate the analog design flow, the current approach falls short in meeting the exact design requirements and plagued by inaccuracies, highlighting the necessity for a more robust approach capable of accurately predicting circuits. In addition, there is a need for an improved dataset collection technique to enhance the overall performance of the automation process. The power management unit (PMU) is a crucial block in any IC that requires the design of low-dropout regulator (LDO) for which amplifiers are fundamental blocks. This research harnesses the capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs) to automate essential amplifier blocks, such as the differential amplifier (DiffAmp) and two-stage operational amplifier (OpAmp). In addition, it proposes an automation framework for the higher level circuitry of the LDO. This article introduces a novel &#8220;TriNet&#8221; architecture designed for various parameters of amplifiers, including gain, bandwidth, and power facilitating precise predictions for DiffAmp and OpAmp, and presents a decoder architecture tailored for LDO. A notable aspect is the development of an efficient technique for acquiring larger datasets in a condensed timeframe.

The DEM algorithm achieves very good averaging of mismatch-induced errors in the succeeding CS-DAC. It features a minimum element transition rate, therefore opimizing the power dissipation and ensuring minimal glitch energy at the output. Due to the chosen network-based architecture, with only a few modifications of the hardware, the decoder allows the integration of a comprehensive current source mismatch calibration that can be fully operated in the background and even in parallel to the regular DEM operation. A proof-ofconcept hardware implementation of the presented decoder was fabricated in a 22-nm FD-SOI CMOS process and characterized in a high-speed DDFS system with a sampling rate of 5 GHz. Measurements reveal a significant improvement in the spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) and signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) when the calibration and DEM are enabled. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SoA), the presented DDFS achieves one of the best figures of merit.</description></item><item><title>1.63 pJ/SOP Neuromorphic Processor With Integrated Partial Sum Routers for In-Network Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10570234</link><description>Neuromorphic computing is promising to achieve unprecedented energy efficiency by emulating the human brain&#8217;s mechanism. Conventional neuromorphic accelerators employ split-and-merge method to map spiking neural networks&#8217; inputs to surpass the fan-in capabilities of a single neuron core. However, this approach gives rise to the risk of accuracy compromise and extra core usage for the merging process. Moreover, it requires excessive data movement and clock cycles to aggregate spikes generated by partial sums instead of total sums obtained from different cores with substantial power and energy overhead. This work presents a novel approach to addressing the challenges imposed by the split-and-merge method. We propose an energy-efficient, reconfigurable neuromorphic processor that leverages several key techniques to mitigate the above issues. First, we introduce a partial sum router circuitry that enables in-network computing (INC), eliminating the need for extra merge cores. Second, we adopt software-defined Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) by leveraging predefined, efficient routing, eliminating power-hungry routing computation. At last, we incorporate fine-grained power gating and clock gating techniques for further power reduction. Experimental results from our test chip demonstrate the lossless mapping of the algorithm and exceptional energy efficiency, achieving an energy consumption of 1.63 pJ/SOP at 0.48 V. This energy efficiency represents a 22.4% improvement compared to the state-of-the-art results. Our proposed neuromorphic processor provides an efficient and flexible solution for neural network processing, mitigating the limitations of the traditional split-and-merge approach while delivering superior energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>VLSI Design of Light-Field Factorization for Dual-Layer Factored Display</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568566</link><description>This article introduces a VLSI design for light-field factorization, aimed at enhancing immersive 3-D visual experiences for computational light-field factored displays. The main design challenges are intensive memory-access demands and high computational complexity. Accordingly, we first propose half-block-based factorization (HBBF) and sparse ray sampling (SRS) to reduce DRAM bandwidth by 99% and SRAM size by 74%. Then, we devise integer hybrid quantization (INTH) to cut down computational logic by 41%, leading to improvements in die area and power efficiency. Finally, we fabricated a processor chip that incorporates 75.1 kB of SRAM and 5.9M logic gates using 40-nm CMOS technology.

However, conventional polar codes are reliant solely on binary ( $2 \times 2$ ) kernels, which restricts their block length to being only powers of 2. In response, multi-kernel (MK) polar codes have been proposed as a viable solution to achieve increased flexibility in code length. This article proposes unrolled and pipelined architectures for encoding both systematic and nonsystematic MK polar codes, capable of high-throughput encoding of codes constructed with binary, ternary ( $3 \times 3$ ), or binary-ternary mixed kernels. Furthermore, two novel nonsystematic stage-folded encoders, designed to minimize resource usage, have been introduced for the encoding of pure-ternary and MK codes. The proposed MK encoders additionally provide the functionality of dynamic kernel assignment. The proposed architectures exhibit an unprecedented level of flexibility by supporting 83 different codes and offering various architectures that provide tradeoffs between throughput and resource consumption. The FPGA implementation results demonstrate that a partially pipelined polar encoder of size  $N=4096$  operating at a frequency of 270 MHz gives a throughput of 1080 Gb/s. In addition, a new compiler scripted in Python is introduced to automatically generate HDL modules for the desired encoders.

The PMR employs passive integrators in parallel to simultaneously integrate the average result of the multiple sequential residual voltages. The proposed PMR technique provides an alternative scheme to enhance the NS rather than increasing the order of the integrator to suppress the instability and power. A prototype 7-bit second-order NS-SAR ADC is designed and simulated in a 130-nm CMOS process. PMR increases the effective number of bits (ENOBs) to 10.6 bit, which enhances the NS effect of 3.6 bit. It achieves a peak signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 65.84 dB over a bandwidth of 1.3 kHz at the oversampling ratio (OSR) of 16.</description></item><item><title>Multidie 3-D Stacking of Memory Dominated Neuromorphic Architectures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609345</link><description>Event-driven neuromorphic processors for artificial intelligence (AI) inference on edge/IoT devices require largeon-chip memory capacity, for efficient execution of spiking neural networks (NNs). In this work, we evaluate 3-D stacking benefits on SENECA, a digital neuromorphic accelerator core, sweeping itson-chip memory capacity from 2 up to 32 Mb in both legacy planar and advanced nanosheet CMOS logic nodes. In a planar CMOS node (GF-22 nm), two-die memory-on-logic (MoL) partitioning enables  $8\times $  moreon-chip memory, and it boosts operating frequency by 7% with 26% less power than the 2-D. Moving to an advanced nanosheet technology (imec A10), multidie (up to 7 dies) MoL stacking enables a performance increase of up to 29% and power savings up to 31%. Furthermore, a core folding (CF) partitioning in A10 shows up to 16% performance improvement with 12% total power savings with respect to the 2-D implementation on the same technology. We also demonstrate no thermal overhead for multidie stacking at advanced nodes for designs exhibiting low power density. These physical design explorations lay the foundation for system technology co-optimization studies for edge devices.</description></item><item><title>Improvement in Resilience of AES Design With Reconfigured CFB Mode Against Power Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596060</link><description>Advanced encryption standard (AES) is used to secure the communication process on the Internet-of-Things (IoT) hardware. It is implementable in various 128-bit modes, such as electronic code book (ECB), cipher block chaining (CBC), cipher feedback (CFB), output feedback (OFB), and counter (CTR), to facilitate parallel processing of data. The noninvasive nature of power analysis attacks (PAAs) to retrieve secret information off a physical device renders such hardware to be unsafe from the adversaries. Also, the assessment of the aforementioned modes for security remains obscured, which is undertaken by this work as a novel attempt. In addition, this work proposes a novel 64-bit version of CFB mode, which provides the highest security with respect to other modes and several unprotected AES designs. PAAs are performed on ASIC platform utilizing UMC 65-nm technology node and a hardware experimental setup using side-channel attack security evaluation board (SASEBO), both at 16-MHz AES frequency and traces sampled at the rate of 1 GSa/s. The measurements to disclose (MTDs) of &gt;1 000 000 provided by the proposed CFB-64 are significantly more than that provided by usual unprotected AES designs. It also offers the highest MTD, and least signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and mutual information (MI) among other modes, indicating the highest security.

The proposed CIM macro has the following features: 1) a sign-extension-less array multiplication circuit structure that eliminates the need for converting partial sums into 2&#8217;s complement, which removes the constraints related to handling specific symbol bits; 2) developing a circuit that avoids signed bit extension shift and accumulate, resulting in reduced area cost; and 3) integrating an adder structure that provides adjustable accuracy, thereby enhancing network adaptability as compared to traditional approximation techniques. A fabricated 28 nm 16-kb sign-extension-less DCIM was tested with the highest MAC speed with 5.6 ns (Signed 8 b IN&amp;amp;W 23 b Out) and achieved the best energy efficiency with 40.15 TOPS/W over a wide range of network adaptability.</description></item><item><title>A 256 &#215; 192 -Pixel Direct Time-of-Flight LiDAR Receiver With a Current-Integrating-Based AFE Supporting 240-m-Range Imaging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643155</link><description>This article presents a direct time-of-flight (DToF) LiDAR with a current-integrating-based analog frontend (AFE), performing long-range (LR) and high-quality imaging. A current-integrating-based transimpedance amplifier (CI-TIA) facilitates a direct current-to-pulse conversion, which not only achieves superior transimpedance gain and noise performance but also adaptively compensates the background-light-induced direct current to alleviate the dynamic range (DR) obstacle in the LR LiDARs. Benefiting from the pulse manner output of the CI-TIA, a pulse position and width converter (PPWC) utilizes lightweight counters to provide the time and intensity information simultaneously, while the latter compensates for the walk error in time intrinsically. Furthermore, the intensity is used to adapt the accumulation window size to improve the imaging quality under high intensity. The prototype LiDAR receiver is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, which achieves a consistent distance error of &lt;1 cm and precision of &lt;0.09% for up to 240-m measurements.

The proposed technique is especially beneficial in cases with significant phase shifts between the excitation current from the current generator (CG) and the input voltage signal produced across the bioZ, through which the CG current flows. This technique employs a tunable reference impedance (TRI) and adaptively adjusts it to match the bioZ in both magnitude and phase, thereby achieving a complex-domain correlation of CG noise. By flowing an identical CG current through both the TRI and bioZ, the noise voltages across the TRI and bioZ caused by the CG current become closely correlated with each other, even in the presence of substantial phase shifts, enabling effective CG noise removal after baseline subtraction. Furthermore, this work proposes a differential-difference current-balancing instrumentation amplifier (DD-CBIA) with quiet chopping for baseline subtraction, offering low power consumption, wide input range, and low input-dependent noise. Measurement results demonstrate significant enhancements in noise performance by a factor of 2.47 and 4.88 for the bioZs with phases of 30&#176; and 60&#176;, respectively, achieving a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 101.5 dB and a figure of merit (FoM) of 150.0 dB. Validation through human-subject experiments using two-electrode configurations on the chest and wrist further supports the effectiveness of the proposed bioZ readout IC.</description></item><item><title>A High Accuracy and Ultra-Energy-Efficient Zero-Shot-Retraining Seizure Detection Processor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684596</link><description>Recently, wearable devices integrating seizure detection processors have been developed to detect seizures in real time for alerting, recording, or in-device treatment purposes. High accuracy and low energy consumption are paramount for seizure detection processors. Many existing seizure detection processors are able to achieve high accuracy when large amounts of seizure data from the test patient is available for the training, which requires the test patient to undergo time-consuming and costly hospitalization due to the low occurrence of seizure data and therefore is impractical. This work proposes a high-accuracy and ultra-energy-efficient zero-shot-retraining seizure detection processor that requires no seizure data from the test patient for retraining. Two novel techniques have been proposed to improve the accuracy and reduce energy consumption, including a hybrid-feature-driven adaptive processing architecture with on-chip learning for improving the accuracy against inter-patient variation and reduce the classification energy consumption and a learning-based adaptive channel selection technique to identify the redundant electroencephalogram (EEG) channels for further energy saving while maintaining high accuracy. The proposed seizure detection processor has been implemented and fabricated in 55-nm CMOS technology. It demonstrates high sensitivity (i.e., 100% event-based sensitivity) and specificity (i.e., 94%) with extremely low energy consumption (i.e.,  $0.07~\mu $ J/classification and  $0.1~\mu $ J/learning) while requiring no seizure data from the test patient for retraining, outperforming the state-of-the-art designs.</description></item><item><title>A Wireless, Multicolor Fluorescence Image Sensor Implant for Real-Time Monitoring in Cancer Therapy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10630875</link><description>Real-time monitoring of dynamic biological processes in the body is critical to understanding disease progression and treatment response. These data, for instance, can help address the lower than 50% response rates to cancer immunotherapy. However, current clinical imaging modalities lack the molecular contrast, resolution, and chronic usability for rapid and accurate response assessments. Here, we present a fully wireless image sensor featuring a  $2.5{\times }5$  mm2 CMOS integrated circuit for multicolor fluorescence imaging deep in tissue. The sensor operates wirelessly via ultrasound (US) at 5-cm depth in oil, harvesting energy with 221-mW/cm2 incident US power density (31% of FDA limits) and backscattering data at 13 kb/s with a bit error rate  $\lt 10{^{-6}}$ . In situ fluorescence excitation is provided by micro-laser diodes controlled with a programmable on-chip driver. An optical front-end combining a multi-bandpass interference filter and a fiber optic plate (FOP) provides &gt;6 OD excitation blocking and enables three-color imaging for detecting multiple cell types. A  $36{\times }40$  pixel array captures images with &lt;125- $\mu $  m resolution. We demonstrate wireless, dual-color fluorescence imaging of both effector and suppressor immune cells in ex vivo mouse tumor samples with and without immunotherapy. These results show promise for providing rapid insight into therapeutic response and resistance, guiding personalized medicine.</description></item><item><title>Omnidirectional Wireless Power Transfer for Millimetric Magnetoelectric Biomedical Implants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10714003</link><description>Miniature bioelectronic implants promise revolutionary therapies for cardiovascular and neurological disorders. Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a significant method for miniaturization, eliminating the need for bulky batteries in today&#8217;s devices. Despite successful demonstrations of millimetric battery-free implants in animal models, the robustness and efficiency of WPT are known to degrade significantly under misalignment incurred by body movements, respiration, heart beating, and limited control of implant orientation during surgery. This article presents an omnidirectional WPT platform for millimetric bioelectronic implants, employing the emerging magnetoelectric (ME) WPT modality, and &#8220;magnetic field steering&#8221; technique based on multiple transmitter (TX) coils. To accurately sense the weak coupling in a miniature implant and adaptively control the multicoil TX array in a closed loop, we develop an active echo (AE) scheme using a tiny coil on the implant. Our prototype comprises a fully integrated 14.2 mm3 implantable stimulator embedding a custom low-power system-on-chip (SoC) powered by an ME film, a TX with a custom three-channel AE RX chip, and a multicoil TX array with mutual inductance cancellation. The AE RX achieves &#8722;161 dBm/Hz input-referred noise with 64 dB gain tuning range to reliably sense the AE signal, and offers fast polarity detection for driver control. AE simultaneously enhances the robustness, efficiency, and charging range of ME WPT. Under 90&#176; rotation from the ideal position, our omnidirectional WPT system achieves  $6.8{ \times }$  higher power transfer efficiency (PTE) than a single-coil baseline. The tracking error of AE negligibly degrades the PTE by less than 2% from using ideal control.</description></item><item><title>A Scalable and Instantaneously Wideband RF Correlator Based on Margin Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10704783</link><description>Correlation is a fundamental operation in radar/ communication signal processing.

Color-center qubits enable a modular architecture that allows for the 3-D integration of photonics, cryo-CMOS control electronics, and qubits in the same package. However, performing quantum operations in a scalable manner requires large currents in the driving coils due to low coil-to-qubit coupling. Moreover, active calibration of the qubit Larmor frequency is required to compensate inhomogeneities of the bias magnetic field. To overcome these challenges, this work proposes both a cryo-CMOS alternating current (AC) controller consisting of a class-DE series-resonant driver and a DC current regulator (DC CR) that uses a triode-biased H-bridge for scalable low-power qubit operations. By experimentally validating the cryo-CMOS performance with a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color-center qubit, the AC controller can drive a Rabi oscillation up to 2.5 MHz with a supply draw of 6.5 mA, and the DC CR can tune the Larmor frequency by &#177;9 MHz while driving up to &#177;20 mA in the bias coil.  $T_{2}^{*}$  coherence times up to  $5.3~\mu $ s and single-qubit gate fidelities above 98% are demonstrated with the cryo-CMOS control using Ramsey experiments and gate set tomography (GST), respectively. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed cryo-CMOS chips and enable the development of a modular quantum processor based on color centers.</description></item><item><title>A 23-GHz TX/LNA Front-End Module for Inter-Satellite Links With 27.8% Peak Efficiency in the TX Path and 3.1-dB NF in the RX Path</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538228</link><description>This article presents a 23-GHz transmitter/low-noise amplifier (TX/LNA) front-end module (FEM) in 130-nm SiGe BiCMOS for inter-satellite links (ISLs) in the system of orbiting low-frequency antenna array (OLFAR). The FEM consists of an LNA, a power amplifier (PA), a variable-gain amplifier (VGA), a phase shifter (PS), and a TX/receiver switch (T/R SW).

The adoption of sub-terahertz (sub-THz) frequencies for such systems relieves the hardware requirements for the physical size and fractional bandwidth (BW). Phased/MIMO arrays, when a large 2-D aperture size is required, are facing great challenges related to high circuit complexities, electronic density, and computation power. This article presents a digitally controlled 265-GHz reflectarray that decouples the designs of active circuits and large passive antenna array. The array is constructed using stitched CMOS chips, fabricated on Intel 16 process, and each unit adopts 1-bit phase quantization and cross-polarization backscatter approaches. With a credit-card size ( $5.6 \times $  cm2), the reflectarray performs 1&#176;-wide pencil beamforming (~42-dBi directivity) and electric steering within &#177;60&#176; range in both azimuth and elevation directions. The reflectarray is also equipped with 780-Mb integrated under-antenna memory, which not only eliminates high-speed data communication during raster scan but also enables techniques such as time-dithering sidelobe reduction, and beam squint corrections. Pairing with a commercial sub-THz transceiver (TRX), this work also, for the first time, demonstrates high-angular-resolution, mechanical-movement-free terahertz (THz) imaging.</description></item><item><title>A ULP Long-Range Active-RF Tag With Automatically Calibrated Antenna-TRX Interface</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10526312</link><description>This article introduces an ultra-low-power (ULP) active-RF tag for long-range event-driven Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications.

To fulfill the high-throughput demand in D2D interfaces, a PAM-based crosstalk cancellation (XTC) technique capable of improving the channel density is proposed along with a doubled per-pin data rate using PAM-4 signaling. Remarkably, the proposed XTC technique only requires a single capacitor at the output node for crosstalk compensation, thereby minimizing bandwidth (BW) degradation by reducing parasitic components. The transmitters leverage a proposed thermometer-weighted driver architecture, characterized by its high energy efficiency and linearity, to facilitate PAM-4 signaling within the capacitively driven link. Additionally, a true-single-ended time-based decoding technique is proposed for the PAM-4 receiver to alleviate both hardware and design complexities.

Source-series terminated (SST) drivers are widely used in conventional FFE (C-FFE) TXs. However, linear resistors in C-FFE SST TXs occupy too much area and add significant parasitic capacitance, degrading power efficiency, and output bandwidth. To overcome these problems, we propose a new feed-forward equalization (FFE) architecture dubbed A-FFE that completely eliminates subtractions between FFE taps and improves the robustness to quantization errors of coefficients. These advantages of the proposed architecture allow to utilize area-and-power-efficient inverter drivers in FFE. An inverter-based four-tap A-FFE TX was designed and fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process. The TX achieved a data rate of 20 Gb/s/pin, an eye height of 55.1 mV, and an eye width of 0.44 UI with a 15-dB PCB trace, while consuming 1.18 pJ/b and achieving the worst eye sensitivity of 68%. The eye-opening was decreased only by 13.6%, when the most sensitive FFE coefficient was reduced by 20%. Because it uses area-efficient inverter drivers without resistors, the TX occupies only  $1149~{\mu }$ m2.</description></item><item><title>A 2.5-nA Area-Efficient Temperature-Independent 176-/82-ppm/&#176;C CMOS-Only Current Reference in 0.11- &#956; m Bulk and 22-nm FD-SOI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10550946</link><description>Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications require nW-power current references that are robust to process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations, to maintain the performance of IoT sensor nodes in a wide range of operating conditions. However, nA-range current references are rarely area-efficient due to the use of large gate-leakage transistors or resistors, which occupy a significant silicon area at this current level. In this article, we introduce a nA-range constant-with-temperature (CWT) current reference, relying on a self-cascode MOSFET (SCM) biased by a four-transistor ultra-low-power voltage reference through a single-transistor buffer. The proposed reference includes a temperature coefficient (TC) calibration mechanism to maintain performance across process corners. In addition, as the proposed design relies on the body effect, it has been fabricated and measured in 0.11- $\mu $ m bulk and 22-nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) to demonstrate feasibility in both technology types. On the one hand, the 0.11- $\mu $ m design consumes a power of 16.8 nW at 1.2 V and achieves a 2.3-nA current with a line sensitivity (LS) of 2.23%/V at  $25~{^{\circ } }$ C and a TC of 176 ppm/&#176;C at 1.2 V from  ${-} 40~{^{\circ } }$ C to  $85~{^{\circ } }$ C. On the other hand, the 22-nm design consumes a power of 16.3 nW at 1.5 V and achieves a 2.5-nA current with a 1.53%/V LS at  $25~{^{\circ } }$ C and an 82-ppm/&#176;C TC at 1.5 V from  ${-} 40~{^{\circ } }$ C to  $85~{^{\circ } }$ C. Thanks to their simple architecture, the proposed references achieve a silicon area of 0.0106 mm2 in  $0.11~{\mu }$ m and 0.0026 mm2 in 22 nm without compromising other figures of merit and are, thus, competitive with state-of-the-art CWT references operating in the same current range.</description></item><item><title>A 0.08%/V 32.3-ppm/&#176;C 36.6-kHz Unregulated Current-Reuse Ring Oscillator With VGS-Ratio-Based Compensation Using One-Type-Only Resistor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508792</link><description>This article introduces a 36.6-kHz unregulated ring oscillator (RO) tailored for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, demonstrating robustness to variations in supply voltage and temperature.

There are three resonators, and each of them is built with a passive N-path filter; while two open-loop operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) are inserted in between to realize the loop filter. The partially time-interleaved implementation enables a wide IF tuning range from 125 to 600 MHz. Besides, the OTAs are free of bandwidth limitation by deploying their equivalent large output resistors as the input resistors of the load N-path filters. Therefore, the BP DSM is power-efficient without compromising its performance. As a validation on the design, a prototype is fabricated in a 65-nm general-purpose (GP) CMOS technology. For a fixed 2-MHz bandwidth, the prototype achieves over 70-dB signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) from 150- to 250-MHz IF; and it achieves over 60-dB SNDR from 125- to 550-MHz IF. The prototype achieves a peak SNDR of 72.0 dB and a maximal dynamic range (DR) of 75.1 dB at 150-MHz IF, while dissipating only 0.42 mW (including the clock generator) from a 1-V supply. This results in a Walden&#8217;s figure of merits (FoM) of 32.3 fJ/conversion-step and a Schreier&#8217;s FoM of 168.8 dB.</description></item><item><title>EQZ-LDO: A Secure Digital Low Dropout Regulator Armed With Detection-Driven Protection Against Correlation Power Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10535528</link><description>This article presents equalizer (EQZ)-low dropout regulator (LDO), an innovative, secure digital low dropout regulator (DLDO) that integrates an attack detector and a detection-driven protection scheme to mitigate correlation power analysis (CPA). EQZ-LDO incurs a remarkably low 0.5% energy-delay-product (EDP) overhead by activating protective measures exclusively upon detecting an attack. EQZ-LDO can detect a resistance change induced by CPA attempts as small as  $1~{\Omega }$  across a wide temperature range of 0 &#176;C&#8211;90 &#176;C. Following detection, by leveraging the switched-capacitor-based equalizer, the DLDO automatically triggers protection to effectively equalize the current draw from the power supply, significantly attenuating the current signature, a major source of potential secret information leakage. The equalization requires only one more pair of switches than the baseline DLDO, incurring only a small area overhead. An EQZ-LDO-equipped advanced encryption standard (AES)-128 module in a 65-nm CMOS remains secure after at least 10 M-trace of CPA. Furthermore, the test vector leakage assessment (TVLA) reveals that the proposed circuits drastically reduce the t-value, an indicator of potential leakage, by  $13.36{\times }$ , compared with the unprotected AES for the 10 M-trace of CPA.</description></item><item><title>A 28-nm 1.3-mW Speech-to-Text Accelerator for Edge AI Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10507859</link><description>Speech-to-text conversion has been extensively deployed for a variety of applications. To implement speech-to-text conversion on energy-constrained edge devices, a hybrid algorithm is adopted in this work. A bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN), composed of the light gated recurrent units (LiGRUs), is included to achieve a high speech-to-text accuracy with fewer network parameters.

Developing energy-efficient, low-latency SLAM systems is essential due to resource constraints and real-time demands. Compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures have been proven to be efficient for matrix multiplications. However, applications for SLAM raise new challenges in memory access and computation aspects: the linear system solving (LS) requires row transformation and causes frequent CIM updates, while the backend optimization causes redundant memory access; back-end optimization dominates SLAM&#8217;s computation and requires high precision and high dynamic range. Thus, we propose SLAM-CIM, a visual SLAM backend processor for edge robotics. A dynamic-range-driven-skipping CIM macro is designed to realize energy-efficient floating point (FP)-multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations. A preconditional-conjugate-gradient-based in-memory linear solver (PILARS) is designed to achieve LS without additional row transformations. This reduces memory access by  $2.08{\times }$  and linear-system-solving latency by  $3.84{\times }$ . SLAM-CIM further minimizes CIM weight updates through incremental bundle adjustment (BA), increasing average CIM utilization by  $2.8{\times }$ . A silicon prototype is fabricated using 28-nm CMOS technology. The measurements show that SLAM-CIM achieves accurate and efficient SLAM operations with an average energy efficiency of 31.53 TFLOPS/W.</description></item><item><title>A 28-nm 18.7 TOPS/mm&#178; 89.4-to-234.6 TOPS/W 8b Single-Finger eDRAM Compute-in-Memory Macro With Bit-Wise Sparsity Aware and Kernel-Wise Weight Update/Refresh</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10505723</link><description>This article reports a high-density 3T1C single-finger (SF) embedded dynamic random access memory (eDRAM) compute-in-memory (CIM) macro.

The proposed asymmetrically terminated PAM-4 driver is optimized for pseudo open drain (POD) channel configurations and improves signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with a larger output swing. The dynamic logic-based high-speed 4-to-1 serializer enhances the transmitter output&#8217;s jitter characteristic by avoiding high-frequency components in the selection signals. The 4-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE) with two operation modes and one sliding tap flexibly compensates for inter-symbol interference (ISI) of the channel.

To achieve sub-0.5V operation, the proposed BGR employs the reverse BGR based complementary-to-absolute-temperature (CTAT) voltage generator, which does not suffer from the settling error and thus reducing the biasing current for the BJT. The reduction in BJT biasing current can reduce the power consumption, thus relieving the burden on the  $2\times $  charge pump as well, in which the minimum supply voltage of the proposed BGR decreases down to 0.4 V. In this paper, we employ a differential pair proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) voltage generator to provide a sufficiently large PTAT voltage. To suppress the temperature coefficient (TC) under limited power and voltage budgets, we propose using a nA level PTAT plus nonlinear current to bias both the BJT and PTAT voltage generator. This approach provides an indirect voltage curvature compensation. The proposed reverse BGR fabricated in 65 nm CMOS, occupies an active area of 0.0470 mm2.

Besides, two interleaving phases can reduce the inductor current to half of that conventional design. Benefiting from a coupled inductor with a negative mutual inductance (M&lt;0), the equivalent I $_{\mathrm {L(AC)}}$  becomes small to achieve low output voltage ripple due to large equivalent inductance Leq in a steady state. Based on the loading current, the phase shedding can change the number of driving phases for high efficiency. Moreover, a transient enhancement circuit is proposed to speed up transient response time. The proposed circuit achieves the maximum inductor current ripple reduction of 9.09% and the maximum P $_{\mathrm {AC\_loss}}$  reduction of 17.36% at D=0.5. Experimental results show 96.1% peak efficiency. In the case of the load step 0.5A to 5A, the recovery time and undershoot are reduced to  $10.7\mu $ s and 133mV, respectively, and in the case of the load step 5A to 0.5A, the recovery time and overshoot are reduced to  $9.4\mu $ s and 147mV, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Loop-Break Decision Feedback Equalizer for DAC/ADC-DSP-Based Wireline Transceivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10629180</link><description>This paper presents a novel digital decision feedback equalizer (DFE) design that can relax the feedback timing constraints for analog-to-digital converter (ADC)-based high-speed wireline receivers.

Consequently, there has been a proliferation of alternative computing paradigms aimed at tackling this disparity. Approximate Computing (AxC) has emerged as a modern way of improving speed, area efficiency, and energy consumption in error-resilient applications such as image processing or machine learning. The trade-off for these enhancements is the loss in accuracy. From a technology point of view, memristors have garnered significant attention due to their low power consumption and inherent non-volatility that makes them suitable for In-Memory Computation (IMC). Another computing paradigm that has risen to tackle the aforementioned disparity between the demand growth and performance improvement. In this work, we leverage a memristive stateful in-memory logic, namely Material Implication (IMPLY). We investigate advanced adder topologies within the context of AxC, aiming to combine the strengths of both of these novel computing paradigms. We present two approximated algorithms for each IMPLY based adder topology. When embedded in an Ripple Carry Adder (RCA), they reduce the number of steps by  $6\%-54\%$  and the energy consumption by  $7\%-54\%$  compared to the corresponding exact full adders. We compare our work to State-of-the-Art (SoA) approximations at circuit-level, which improves the speed and energy efficiency by up to 72% and 34%, while lowering the Normalized Median Error Distance (NMED) by up to 81%. We evaluate our adders in four common image processing applications, for which we introduce two new test datasets as well. When applied to image processing, our proposed adders can reduce the number of steps by up to 60% and the energy consumption by up to 57%, while also improving the quality metrics over the SoA in most cases.</description></item><item><title>A Phase Interpolated Dual-Phase Adaptive On-Time Controlled Buck Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10597378</link><description>This paper introduces a dual-phase buck converter that utilizes a phase interpolator for interleaving, based on adaptive on-time control.

Traditionally, the CRC and FEC encoding circuits in JESD204C are implemented independently of each other, which consumes a significant amount of hardware resources. Therefore, a high logic density CRC and FEC logic sharing (CFLS) encoding circuit for JESD204C controller is proposed in this paper, and the logic density of the encoding circuit is improved by sharing the registers and common encoding factor (CEF). Meanwhile, a straightforward critical path delay (CPD) calculation method was proposed to assess whether the data transmission delay satisfies the requirements of CFLS circuits. This method is derived in conjunction with the manipulation of the common factor matrix, thus reducing computational complexity. The CFLS encoding circuit proposed in this paper is verified with an FPGA platform, and the results show that the circuit can realize CRC and FEC function with a 21.96% reduction in hardware resources, compared to the traditional methods. The area of the JESD204C controller with CFLS encoding circuits is 0.09 mm2, by using a 40-nm CMOS process, and the power consumption is 24.66 mW according to the post-layout simulation.</description></item><item><title>De-Correlation and De-Bias Post-Processing Circuits for True Random Number Generator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10595992</link><description>True random number generators (TRNGs) are commonly used in hardware security for secure authentication, data encryption, etc. The raw random numbers often exhibit defects. The most commonly observed defects are bias and correlations. Post processing techniques have been developed to address them. The von Neumann method addresses bias, but it requires input that is uncorrelated and has an identical distribution. On the other hand, the Markov chain can address correlation but introduce bias. In this work, we research the lightweight combination of two techniques. We verified that MKV2(QL4)/VN2 performs well for both Markov and non-Markov model bitstreams. MKV1(QL8)/VN8W is effective for the Markov model. The randomness is verified by NIST SP 800&#8211;22 and 800-90B, and ENT, respectively. Both of these circuits require only 16 bits of memory, which is 12 times smaller than in previous work. MKV1(QL8)/VN8W is implemented using 65-nm CMOS. A prototype chip demonstrates a minimum energy consumption of 0.149 pJ/bit at 0.45V. When applied to a latch-based TRNG, it can double the operation frequency thanks to the enhanced decorrelation.

Generally, microwave sensors utilized in field measurement setups for dielectric sensing often face significant challenges, such as high costs, limited accuracy and resolution, and the potential need for extensive equipment. To address this, PIN diodes are incorporated into the structure, enabling tunable RPS to extend the capacity to measure phase variations across a broader range, leading to higher resolution while preserving the same compact form factor. Also, exciting the TDT-RPS sensor with a sine-wave signal instead of a pulse at a single frequency improves the accuracy since the Material Under Test (MUT) is dispersive. Moreover, two key components have been integrated into the RPS structure to estimate phase difference variations using the TDT technique: a power splitter and a compact commercial phase detector (AD8302). This integration minimizes the necessary measurement equipment in the testing setup. Consequently, the proposed TDT-RPS can be integrated into Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and IoT systems for in-situ scenarios, making it a promising solution for use in various fields such as biomedical, agriculture, and chemical industries.</description></item><item><title>An Open-Circuit Fault Diagnosis for Three-Phase PWM Rectifier Without Grid Voltage Sensor Based on Phase Angle Partition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623173</link><description>In order to accurately locate the open-circuit fault of power tube for three-phase PWM rectifier under the grid-voltage sensorless control strategy, an open-circuit fault diagnosis algorithm based on phase angle partitions of the current and voltage is proposed. To improve dynamic response for the system, predictive current control is implemented. The real-time change rate of the grid-current phase angle is utilized to determine whether a fault occurs. Based on the zero value platform in the grid-side distortion current generated by open-circuit faults, the corresponding phase angles for the grid current and the grid voltage are partitioned to locate the fault tubes. In a grid voltage sensorless control system, the grid voltage information obtained by the voltage observer and phase-locked loop can be susceptible to distortion or interference. To enhance the accuracy of phase-locked angle, a double generalized second-order integrator is used. The proposed open-circuit fault detection method can realize rapid diagnosis and location for single and double power tubes under grid-voltage sensorless predictive current control. Finally, experimental results are presented to verify the feasibility of the diagnosis method.</description></item><item><title>Low-Voltage CMOS Capacitor-Less LDOs: Bulk-Driven Versus Gate-Driven Comparative Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638180</link><description>This paper explores the feasibility of a capacitor-less (CL) low-dropout (LDO) regulator to operate efficiently in a low-voltage environment. The CL-LDO scheme selected is based on a unity-gain feedback configuration around the error amplifier (EA), so that the inclusion of high-value on-chip resistors is avoided and different key parameters, such as the power supply rejection or the noise, are optimized. A comparative analysis has been carried out over the same LDO structure including a bulk-driven and a gate-driven EA, respectively. The pass branch of the voltage regulator is provided with pseudo-class-AB operation, in order to lead to a very small quiescent current in the standby operation mode, whereas a very large current can be delivered to the load when required. Both regulators were designed and fabricated in 180 nm CMOS technology to operate with a maximum supply voltage of 1.8 V. The extensive experimental characterization showed that the bulk-driven LDO can achieve a significantly lower minimum supply voltage, i.e., 0.6 V, as compared to the gate-driven counterpart, 1 V, under the same reference voltage and load current conditions.</description></item><item><title>A Triboelectric Energy Harvesting IC With High-Voltage Synchronous Electric Charge Extraction Strategy and Superior Systematic Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10550063</link><description>Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs), as emerging mechanical energy harvesters, have attracted extensive research interests.

Compared to former frameworks, LCDSE achieves up to  $4\times $  delay speedup,  $7.9\times $  energy-delay-product decrease and  $2.5\times $  area-delay-product reduction along with time cost saving by up to  $11.3\times $ , demonstrating its superior optimization efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Predefined-Time Observer-Based Fast Power Allocation for Battery Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10527370</link><description>This brief deals with the power allocation problem of battery energy storage systems (BESSs), in which battery units work cooperatively to not only meet the power demand of microgrid but also satisfy the constraint of state-of-charge (SoC). To this end, distributed power and state observers with predefined-time convergence are designed using the dynamic average consensus (DAC) mechanism. In contrast to the current findings, where the settling-time is difficult to ascertain, the settling-time can be provided in advance here. Then, observer-based power allocation strategy is further proposed, which enables BESSs to allocate the unbalanced power rapidly and balance SoC dynamically. Simulation results are given to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Safety Control for Constrained Uncertain Robotic Systems: A Neural Network-Based High-Order Control Barrier Function Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538425</link><description>In this brief, a neural network-based high-order control barrier function (NNHoCBF) is proposed to address the safety control problem of constrained uncertain robotic systems, where the radial basis function-based neural network is introduced to reconstruct uncertain robotic systems. By proving the non-negative nature of NNHoCBFs, Lyapunov-like conditions are obtained to ensure the constraint satisfaction of uncertain robotic systems. Moreover, to ensure the safe tracking control for constrained uncertain robotic systems, a minimum energy quadratic program (QP) with Lyapunov-like conditions is constructed as constraints on nominal control inputs, and the safe tracking controllers of robotic systems are then obtained by solving the minimum energy QP. Consequently, the safety and tracking performances of constrained uncertain robotic systems can be guaranteed simultaneously. Finally, simulation tests on a two-link robotic system are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed controller.</description></item><item><title>Hardware-Friendly Approximation for Swish Activation and Its Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10510410</link><description>This paper addresses the challenges associated with implementing the Swish activation function in hardware.

Compared to standard SNNs, liquid state machine (LSM), the spiking variant of reservoir computing, exhibits advantages in image classification, and are especially more promising in speech recognition. However, LSM-based neuromorphic processors suffer from weight storage overhead in resource-constrained edge applications. To address this, we propose ghost reservoir: a memory-efficient LSM based neuromorphic processor enabling on-chip spike-time-dependent plasticity-based backpropagation (BP-STDP) learning. For the LSM reservoir layer, we adopt a stateless-neuron model and an on-the-fly weight re-generation scheme to avoid the storages for both membrane potentials and weights. For the readout learning layer, a stochastic weight update approach is implemented to reduce the memory bit-width. These techniques contribute to an aggregate of a 482.5 KB on-chip memory reduction on the FPGA prototype. Implemented on the very-low-cost Xilinx Zynq-7010 device, our prototype achieved real-time processing, demonstrated comparably high on-chip learning accuracies of 94.93%, 84.65%, and 92% on the MNIST, N-MNIST, and FSDD datasets, respectively. These experimental results indicate that our LSM-based lightweight neuromorphic design is quite suitable for speech and visual recognition tasks in many resource-constrained edge intelligent applications.</description></item><item><title>A Contention-Free Wordline Supporting Circuit for High Wordline Resistance in Sub-10-nm SRAM Designs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10542405</link><description>A contention-free wordline supporting (CFWLS) circuit is proposed for SRAM in sub-10 nm technologies. The CFWLS resolves the problem of performance degradation caused by significant RC delays with increasing wordline interconnect resistance. A low-skewed sensing inverter utilizes a diode-connected PMOS to detect the wordline rising transition with negligible contention. A supporting PMOS supplies charge to the end of the wordline. By using a replica signal of the wordline enable (WLENt), sufficient charge can be supplied during the entire evaluation phase. The proposed CFWLS has a noise-tolerant characteristic because it complements the floating node by using a pull-up path in the sensing inverter. The WL rising time is improved by 48-57% in post-layout simulation compared to the conventional SRAM without a supporting circuit. The clock-to-bitline (half-VDD) delay is also improved by 20%, while the energy and area overheads of CFWLS are only 7% and 1.7%, respectively. In the test-chip measurements, the read delay for a pass is improved by 180 ps (16%) in sub-3 nm technologies.</description></item><item><title>A Novel 5L Boosting Inverter With Reduced Spike Current</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475701</link><description>This brief introduces a novel five-level inverter with a single DC source that uses only seven power switches and one capacitor.

Improved by the traditional VD power stage, the dual-output DC voltages are achieved by adding a power transistor. Thanks to the proposed power stage topology, the dual-output DC voltages realize full-wave rectification charging and a voltage conversion ratio (VCR) greater than 1 can be realized, which benefits the robustness of the WPT system under the loosely coupled link. The SPFM control is proposed to regulate the dual-output voltages sequentially. Under the SPFM control, each operating phase occupies an independent rectification cycle to avoid channel conduction problems. Moreover, to gain better power conversion efficiency (PCE), the offset current delay compensation technique is used. The proposed regulating rectifier is fabricated in 180nm CMOS process, occupying an area of 0.45mm2. The measurement results show that the proposed dual-output regulating rectifier outputs DC voltages at 3.3V and 2.5V respectively with ripples of 65.4mV and 52.7mV and achieves fast load transient responses. The maximum PCE and VCR are achieved at 90% and 1.67, respectively. The rectifier can output a maximum power of 60.7 mW, satisfying sub-100mW biomedical implants.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Four-Port Converter With All Bi-Directional Ports Having Common Ground for Photo-Voltaic Hybrid Energy Storage DC System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10517961</link><description>The rise in renewable energy generation in recent decades resulted in the proliferation of Energy Storage Systems (ESS) for reliable power delivery. The power flow in ESS can be separated into a low-frequency component due to daily interaction between average generation and consumption patterns, and a high-frequency component due to radical increase/decrease in generation/load demand. The former can be catered by utilizing high energy density ESS like a battery, whereas the latter necessitate fast response ESS like a supercapacitor. This envisages the requirement of a Hybrid ESS (HESS) consisting of a battery and a supercapacitor. To address this requirement a novel Four-port Converter (FPC) to integrate solar Photo-Voltaic (PV) and HESS with DC load/grid is proposed in this brief. The resultant system is named Four-Port Solar PV-based Hybrid Energy Storage DC System (FPSHDS). Key features of the FPSHDS in comparison to existing schemes are: it&#8217;s all four ports (a) are inductively interfaced enhancing overall system reliability, (b) facilitates bidirectional power flow enhancing flexibility in interfacing PV, HESS, and DC load/grid, and (c) have a common ground eliminating leakage current concerns for solar-PV system. The design and control strategy of FPSHDS is discussed and validated using a 250 W experimental prototype.</description></item><item><title>Watermarking-Based Defense Mechanism in LFC of Electricity Grids Compromised by Covert Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10518163</link><description>This brief focuses on improving the load frequency control (LFC) performance of a multi-area power system compromised by covert attacks. In this regard, a novel detection technique based on the multiplicative watermarking and Luenberger observer is developed to identify covert attacks applied to the system. In the presented detection strategy, a special watermark generator filter produces a dummy signal on the original signal transmitted through the insecure communication channels. In addition, there is a watermark equalization filter at the end of the communication channel, which cancels out the impact of the watermark signal, resulting in the recovery of the original signal. A PI controller tuned by the deep reinforcement learning algorithm and dependent on the Luenberger observer is utilized as the secondary frequency control strategy to mitigate the impacts of the convert attacks. The OPAL-RT real-time emulator-based results show the proposed defense strategy successfully detects and mitigates the covert attacks imposed on the system.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Single-Switch High-Gain DC&#8211;DC Converter With Active Switched Inductor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10520660</link><description>This brief presents a non-isolated, novel single-switch high-gain DC-DC converter with an active switched inductor (NSSHG-ASI) designed for fuel-cell and photovoltaic (PV) powered systems.

The embedding layers with large memory capacity requirement and high bandwidth demand have been identified as the bottleneck of personalized recommendation inference. To mitigate the memory bandwidth bottleneck, near-memory processing (NMP) would be an effective solution which utilizes the through-silicon via (TSV) bandwidth within 3D-stacked DRAMs. However, existing NMP architectures suffer from the limited memory bandwidth caused by hard-to-scale TSVs. To overcome this obstacle, integrating the compute-logic near memory banks becomes a promising but challenging solution, since large memory capacity requirement limits the use of 3D-stacked DRAMs and irregular memory accesses lead to poor data locality, heavy TSV data traffic and low bank-level bandwidth utilization. To address this problem, we propose RecPIM, the first in-memory processing system for personalized recommendation inference using near-bank architecture based on 3D-stacked memory. From the hardware perspective, we introduce a heterogeneous memory system combined with 3D-stacked DRAM and DIMMs to accommodate large embedding tables and provide high bandwidth. By integrating processing logic units near memory banks on DRAM dies, our architecture can exploit the enormous bank-level bandwidth which is much higher than TSV bandwidth. Then, we integrate a small scratchpad memory to exploit the unique data reusability of DL-based personalized recommendation systems. Furthermore, we adopt a unidirectional data communication scheme to avoid additional cross-vault data transfer. From the software perspective, we present a customized programming model to facilitate memory management and task offloading. To reduce the data communication through TSVs and enhance the utilization of bank-level bandwidth, we develop an efficient data mapping scheme by partitioning the vector into smaller subvectors. Experimental results show that RecPIM achieves up to  $2.58\times $  speedup and 49.8% energy saving for data movement over the state-of-the-art NMP solution.</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency Power Obfuscation Switched-Capacitor DC&#8211;DC Converter Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10509707</link><description>Side-channel attacks (SCAs) have been shown to be very effective in breaking cryptographic engines.

We evaluated the design by analyzing the power supply to an advanced encryption standard (AES) unit powered by the proposed converter. CPA fails after evaluation with  $10k$  traces. Two different topologies of the switched-capacitor circuit are analyzed for their contribution to side-channel power information leakage. The three-phase POSC is designed with both switched-capacitor converters (SCC1 and SCC2) and achieves efficiency of 77% and 70%.</description></item><item><title>GREEN: An Approximate SIMD/MIMD CGRA for Energy-Efficient Processing at the Edge</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10488043</link><description>The rapid evolution of compute-intensive programs from bio-signal to image-, and video processing has motivated moving toward coarse grained reconfigurable architectures (CGRAs), having high-parallelism capability with post-fabrication datapath versatility. To enhance energy efficiency of such error-resilient applications, state-of-the-art (SoA) CGRAs exploit approximation techniques, while maintaining an acceptable accuracy for the final quality of result (QoR). However, such CGRAs suffer from overheads of utilizing separate Add/Mul/Div units. We propose GREEN as an energy-efficient CGRA, which enables synergistic effects of a chain of approximation and optimization techniques in various levels of abstraction, from application-, to architecture-, to circuit-level, in a cross-layer hierarchy. Enabling this, GREEN offers different levels of energy-accuracy tradeoffs through the flexibility of its small processing elements (PEs), each of which can support various functionalities and precision-adaptability in a single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) or multiple instruction, multiple data (MIMD) manner. Experimental results obtained with Synopsys Design Compiler and Cadence Innovus at 45-nm CMOS technology node demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed SISD/SIMD/MIMD CGRA over the accurate and SoA counterparts. In particular, the MIMD mode of GREEN enables up to  $6.6\times $  higher throughput while dissipating 21% less energy than the accurate counterpart. Moreover, the end-to-end evaluation of GREEN variants on eight single- and multikernel applications from classification, bio-signal (ECG/EEG), and image/video processing domains demonstrates significant performance improvement, compared to the accurate CGRA. In particular, GREEN-MIMD not only speed-ups the ECG QRS detection by 49% and consumes 43% less area and 66% less energy than the accurate CGRA, but also maintains the heartbeat detection accuracy at 100%. GREEN implementations is available at https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/pd-downloads.</description></item><item><title>STATION: State Encoding-Based Attack-Resilient Sequential Obfuscation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10502250</link><description>The unauthorized duplication of design intellectual property (IP) and illegal overproduction of integrated circuits (ICs) are hardware security threats plaguing the security of the globalized IC supply chain. Researchers have developed various countermeasures, such as logic locking, layout camouflaging, and split manufacturing, to overcome the security threat of IP piracy and unauthorized overproduction. Logic locking is a holistic solution among all countermeasures since it safeguards the design IP against untrusted entities, such as untrusted foundries, test facilities, or end-users, throughout the globalized IC supply chain. There are well-known logic locking techniques for combinational circuits with well-established security properties; however, their sequential counterparts remain vulnerable. Since most practical designs are inherently sequential, it is essential to develop secure obfuscation techniques to protect sequential designs. This article proposes a sequential obfuscation technique, STATION, building on the principles of finite state machine encoding schemes. STATION is resilient against various attacks on sequential obfuscation&#8212;input-output (I/O) query attacks and structural attacks, including the ones targeting sequential obfuscation&#8212;which have broken all state-of-the-art sequential obfuscation techniques. STATION achieves good resilience and desired security against various I/O and structural attacks, which we ascertain by launching 9 different attacks on all tested circuits. Moreover, STATION ensures tolerable overheads in power, performance, and area, such as 8.75%, 1.22%, and 5.63% on the largest tested circuit, containing 102 inputs, 7 outputs,  ${6.1\times 10^{4}}$  gates, 7 flip flops, 100 states, and  ${3.0\times 10^{3}}$  transitions.</description></item><item><title>RE-Specter: Examining the Architectural Features of Configurable CNN With Power Side-Channel</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10509603</link><description>As domain-specific training data is recognized as valuable intellectual property, acquiring well-trained weights in convolutional neural networks (CNN) has emerged as a new threat to the neural network design community. To design a CNN accelerator that is resilient to side-channel threats, it is crucial to have an accurate and efficient security-driven framework at the early design stage. However, there is no standard way to perform root-cause analysis on the power side channel that exists in FPGA-based CNN accelerators. Therefore, we build RE-Specter, a framework that facilitates security-driven design space exploration (DSE) across various building components, combination patterns, and parallelism configurations in CNNs. The goal is to fully understand the power side-channel effects resulting from architectural modifications or optimization decisions. We further compare the benchmarks considering precision, resource utilization, and power side-channel leakage. Finally, we experimentally explore the design space of various architectural features. The experimental results show that low-bit precision delivers more secure architectures ( $68.9\times $  among DSPs,  $2439\times $  among LUTs) in measurement-to-disclosure (MTD), but mixed-precision strategies are necessary to maintain the model accuracy. For loop optimization, in 16-parallel scenario, accumulator-based architecture outperforms the architecture featuring an adder tree with the improvements of  $8.28\times $  in MTD and  $1.38\times $  in PST.</description></item><item><title>ARCTIC: Approximate Real-Time Computing in a Cache-Conscious Multicore Environment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10496588</link><description>Improving result-accuracy in approximate computing (AC)-based time-critical systems, without violating power constraints of the underlying circuitry, is gradually becoming challenging with the rapid progress in technology scaling. The execution span of each AC real-time tasks can be split into a couple of parts: 1) the mandatory part, execution of which offers a result of acceptable quality, followed by 2) the optional part, which can be executed partially or completely to refine the initially obtained result in order to increase the result-accuracy, while respecting the time constraint. In this article, we introduce a novel hybrid offline&#8211;online scheduling strategy, ARCTIC, for AC real-time tasks. The goal of real-time scheduler of ARCTIC is to maximize the results-accuracy (QoS) of the task set with opportunistic shedding of the optional part, while respecting system-wide constraints. During execution, ARCTIC retains exclusive copy of the private cache blocks only in the local caches in a multicore system and no copies of these blocks are maintained at the other caches, and improves performance (i.e., reduces execution-time) by accumulating more live blocks on-chip. Combining offline scheduling with the online cache optimization improves both QoS and energy efficiency. While surpassing prior arts, our proposed strategy reduces the task rejection rate by up to 25%, whereas enhances QoS by 10%, with an average energy&#8211;delay&#8211;product gain of up to 9.1%, on an 8-core system.</description></item><item><title>MCAM: Memductance Components Adaptive Model for Efficient Modeling of Memductance of Memristive Devices for Neuromorphic Circuits and Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10494379</link><description>As an emerging technology, memristive devices have flourished to develop energy-efficient computing systems in the form of emerging nonvolatile memories (eNVMs), synaptic connections, and logic design, which could play a critical role in microelectronic design. In neuromorphic applications, the power-off state of a nonvolatile memristor is crucial, as it determines the learning and forgetting of embedded synaptic efficacy. Due to the complexity of the transport mechanisms contributing to the memristor current, memristor modeling remains a critical challenge. The memductance of memristors includes both volatile and nonvolatile components, which can be modeled using a memductance components adaptive model (MCAM). The MCAM enables researchers to model the memductance of memristors, which can be used in neuromorphic applications and logic design. Mathematical explanations and two physical models of memristors extracted from experimental results demonstrate the model&#8217;s accuracy. The application of MCAM for synaptic updates in spiking neuromorphic systems is also shown.</description></item><item><title>Systematic Generation of Memristor-Transistor Single-Phase Combinational Logic Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10488036</link><description>The objective of our research is to create efficient methods and tools for the quick and thorough assessment of emerging digital circuit devices, facilitating the adoption of promising ones. In this work, we develop methods and tools for hybrid technology that combines memristors with MOS transistors and demonstrates their effectiveness. Although several types of memristor-transistor logic have been proposed, 15 years of research has created a small set of logic cells. We propose a systematic method for generating new and efficient memristor-transistor single-phase combinational logic cells. At the core of our approach is a cell enumerator, which enables us to explore a wide range of cell designs, including nonintuitive ones, and a data-driven inductive learning method, which identifies new properties of such cells and scales up our explorations. In conjunction with other completely new tools, these create a comprehensive and definitive library of logic cells. Our new cells provide significant improvements or significantly distinct Pareto-optimal alternatives for the few logic functions for which prior research has created cells. Importantly, our methods enable us to discover a previously unknown synergistic operation between memristors and transistors that occurs for specific cell topologies. We harness this synergy to develop a method for adding memristors to low-area pass-transistor circuits such that they produce strong output voltages and low power, including for patterns that cause ratioed operation. We have also developed a new memristor-transistor logic family, namely controlled-AND (cAND)/controlled-OR (cOR), which includes many of the best cells. We have also developed a constructive method for designing such cells.</description></item><item><title>Unleashing Network/Accelerator Co-Exploration Potential on FPGAs: A Deeper Joint Search</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10505904</link><description>Recently, algorithm-hardware (HW) co-exploration for neural networks (NNs) has become the key to obtaining high-quality solutions. However, previous efforts for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) focus on neural architecture search (NAS) while lacking HW architecture search (HAS), thus limiting the full potential of co-design. Although expanding the scope of HAS offers performance potential, the exponentially increased joint search space presents a formidable challenge. To address this, we propose a deep and efficient framework NAF, which jointly searches for Networks and Accelerators for FPGAs in a balanced co-search space. First, we adjust the NAS space and then introduce a block-level bitwidth search on the software side. Meanwhile, we design a HW-friendly quantization algorithm to facilitate HW efficiency and accuracy. Second, we design a dataflow-configurable HW unit with computation and memory access optimizations for quantized multiplication. Based on this, we incorporate critical heterogeneous multicore architecture exploration on the HW side. Third, to enable rapid HW feedback in the enlarged HAS space, we perform resource and performance modeling and design a fast HW generation algorithm based on the genetic algorithm. Specifically, we apply optimization techniques, like mapping space pruning, greedy bandwidth allocation, and coarse-grained search, to speed up this process. We validate NAF in edge and cloud scenarios. Experimental results show that NAF efficiently explores a significantly larger joint space and provides high-quality solutions. Compared with previous state-of-the-art co-design works, the searched convolutional neural network-accelerator pairs improve the throughput by  $2.07\times \sim 7.10\times $  and energy efficiency by  $1.41\times \sim 2.27\times $  under similar accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.</description></item><item><title>Cascade: An Application Pipelining Toolkit for Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504565</link><description>While coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) have emerged as promising programmable accelerator architectures, they require automatic pipelining of applications during their compilation flow to achieve high performance. Current CGRA compilers either lack pipelining altogether resulting in low application performance, or perform exhaustive pipelining resulting in high power and resource consumption. We address these challenges by proposing Cascade, an end-to-end open-source application compiler for CGRAs that achieves both state-of-the-art performance and fast compilation times. The contributions of this work are: 1) a novel post place-and-route (PnR) application pipelining technique for CGRAs that accounts for interconnect hop delays during pipelining but in a unique way that avoids cyclic scheduling and PnR, 2) a register resource usage optimization technique that leverages the scheduling logic in CGRA memory tiles to minimize the number of register resources used during pipelining, and 3) an automated CGRA timing model generator, an application timing analysis tool, and a large set of existing and novel application pipelining techniques integrated into an end-to-end compilation flow. Cascade achieves 8 -  $34\times $  lower critical path delay and 7 -  $190\times $  lower energy-delay product (EDP) across a variety of dense image processing and machine learning workloads, and 3 -  $5.2\times $  lower critical path delay and 2.5 -  $5.2\times $  lower EDP on sparse workloads, compared to a compiler without pipelining. Cascade mitigates the performance and energy-efficiency drawbacks of existing CGRA compilers, and enables further research into CGRAs as flexible, yet competitive accelerator architectures.</description></item><item><title>EnsGuard: A Novel Acceleration Framework for Adversarial Ensemble Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10502340</link><description>To defend against various adversarial attacks, it is essential to develop a robust and high computing efficiency defence framework. Adversarial ensemble learning is the most effective technique for defending against adversarial example attacks, which constructs ensembles of multiple Deep neural networks (DNNs) with adversarial training to obtain stronger defense. However, ensemble models run noticeably slower on existing DNN accelerators than single-model inference. Deploying ensemble models on the existing DNN accelerators leads to many critical issues such as the underutilization of hardware resources. To tackle emerging challenges, we propose EnsGuard, a dynamic asymmetric multicore systolic array architecture for adversarial ensemble learning inference to fully exploit both static and dynamic parallelism of ensemble models. Specifically, on the hardware level, we propose a novel instruction set extension and develop efficient architecture components to fully exploit the new hardware abstraction of scattered idle computing cores, and use them to dynamically create on-the-fly neural processing units (fNPUs). Moreover, we propose a computing power recycle mechanism to run on-the-fly models (small models) on fNPUs by carefully orchestrating execution order of ensemble models for maximizing hardware resources and bandwidth utilization. On the software level, EnsGuard adopts an integrated hardware/randomized ensemble co-design optimizer aiming at winning both faster inference and higher adversarial robustness. On top of that, a multimodel mapping method based on decision tree is proposed to enable the interleaving of different DNN executions both spatially and temporally, and mitigate straggler problems. Evaluation with a diverse set of workloads shows significant gains in throughput ( $4.4\times $ ) and energy reduction ( $3.2\times $ ).</description></item><item><title>Secure Delegated Variational Quantum Algorithms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10505905</link><description>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) can train parameterized quantum circuits via classical optimizers to find approximate solutions to some important problems. They can overcome the limitations of existing quantum technologies only allowing for a few qubits and small circuit depth and are considered as one of the most promising methods for achieving quantum advantages in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. In this article, we propose secure delegated VQAs by utilizing quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE) for users with limited quantum power to delegate the task of running VQAs to remote quantum servers while still keeping the training data private. First, a client-friendly QHE scheme that allows quantum servers to perform calculation on encrypted data is proposed to be suitable for VQAs. Then, delegated VQAs based on the given QHE scheme are presented, where servers can train the ansatz circuit using the encrypted data. Finally, a delegated variational quantum classifier to identify handwritten digit images is given as a specific example of delegated VQAs and simulated on the cloud platform of Original Quantum to show the feasibility. Secure delegated VQAs will provide significant technical support for future quantum cloud services.</description></item><item><title>AutoAI2C: An Automated Hardware Generator for DNN Acceleration on Both FPGA and ASIC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508183</link><description>Recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) and the slowing of Moore&#8217;s law have made domain-specific hardware accelerators for DNNs (i.e., DNN chips) a promising means for enabling more extensive DNN applications. However, designing DNN chips is challenging due to: 1) the vast and nonstandardized design space and 2) different DNN models&#8217; varying performance preferences regarding hardware micro-architecture and dataflows. Therefore, designing a DNN chip often takes a large team of interdisciplinary experts months to years. To enable flexible and efficient DNN chip design, we propose AutoAI2C: a DNN chip generator that can automatically generate both FPGA- and ASIC-based DNN accelerator implementation (i.e., synthesizable hardware and deployment code) with optimized algorithm-to-hardware mapping, given the DNN model specification from mainstream machine learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch). Specifically, AutoAI2C consists of two major components: 1) a Chip Predictor, which can efficiently and reliably predict a DNN accelerator&#8217;s energy, latency, and resource consumption using the proposed graph-based intermediate accelerator representation and 2) a Chip Builder, which can generate and optimize DNN accelerator designs by automatically exploring the design space based on targeting metrics and the Chip Predictor&#8217;s performance feedback. Extensive experiments show that our Chip Predictor&#8217;s predictions differ by &lt;10% from real-measured ones. Furthermore, AutoAI2C generated accelerators can achieve performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art accelerators, achieving up to a  $2.12\times $  throughput improvements or  $2.4\times $  latency reduction with the same level of hardware resource usage, or reducing energy consumption by up to  $1.6\times $ , when running the same DNN workloads.</description></item><item><title>Intelligent Inverse Designs of Impedance Matching Circuits With Generative Adversarial Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10492453</link><description>Impedance matching circuits (IMCs) are crucial modules in radio frequency (RF) front-end components, devices, and systems, affecting the performance of the whole systems. However, the design process of IMCs has to require intense manual interventions with high computational costs. To alleviate this problem, a novel scheme for inversely designing IMCs is presented in this work based on neural network technology. Such IMC inverse design framework consists of two mapping-based deep neural networks (DNNs). The first one is an untrained generative adversarial network (GAN) that maps from the design requirements to the regularized S-parameters curves. The second one is an inversion network that maps from the S-parameters and the target impedance to the designed circuit parameters. With the cascaded GAN and inversion network, an efficient method for designing IMC-based filtering antenna is introduced, which takes about 1/17 the time compared to the traditional EM-based design and optimization methods. Further, three power amplifiers (PAs) with multiple IMCs are inversely-designed based on the proposed framework. In experimental demonstration, the elaborate prototypes are fabricated and measured, where the measured results fully satisfy the demand performance.</description></item><item><title>ChatEDA: A Large Language Model Powered Autonomous Agent for EDA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10485372</link><description>The integration of a complex set of electronic design automation (EDA) tools to enhance interoperability is a critical concern for circuit designers.

This article proposes a deep-testing method for identifying Trojans of particular concern to middle-to-high-end users, with a focus on illegal instructions. A hidden instruction Trojan can employ a low-probability sequence of normal instructions as a boot sequence, which is followed by an illegal instruction that triggers the Trojan. This enables the Trojan to remain deeply hidden within the processor. It then exploits an intrusion mechanism to acquire Linux control authority by setting a hidden interrupt as its payload. We have developed an unbounded model checking (UMC) technique to uncover such Trojans. The proposed UMC technique has been optimized with slicing based on the input cone, head-point replacement, and backward implication. Our experimental results demonstrate that the presented instruction Trojans can survive detection by existing methods, thus allowing normal users to steal root user privileges and compromising the security of processors. Moreover, our proposed deep-testing method is empirically shown to be a powerful and effective approach for detecting these instruction Trojans.</description></item><item><title>One-Shot Online Testing of Deep Neural Networks Based on Distribution Shift Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10494391</link><description>Neural networks (NNs) are capable of learning complex patterns and relationships in data to make predictions with high accuracy, making them useful for various tasks. However, NNs are both computation-intensive and memory-intensive methods, making them challenging for edge applications. Hence, hardware AI accelerators architectures based on computation-in-memory (CiM) architectures with nonvolatile memristive crossbars are gaining attention. Although memristive devices offer benefits, such as power efficiency, parallelism, and nonvolatility, they suffer from nonidealities, leading to various faults and parameter variations, both during manufacturing and lifetime operations. This can lead to faulty computations and, in turn, degradation of post-mapping inference accuracy, which is unacceptable for many applications, including safety-critical applications. Therefore, proper testing of NN hardware accelerators is of utmost importance for functional safety. In this article, we propose a one-shot testing approach that can test NNs accelerated on memristive crossbars with only one test vector, making it very suitable for online testing applications. Our approach can consistently achieve 100% fault coverage across several large topologies with up to 201 layers and challenging tasks like semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, compared to existing methods, the fault coverage is improved by up to 24%, the memory overhead is only 0.0123 MB, a reduction of up to  $19980\times $  and the number of test vectors is reduced by  $10000\times $ .</description></item></channel></rss>
