The proposed design repurposes the receiver-side compensation inductor as the primary winding of a multiwinding transformer, enabling the balancing function to be realized without introducing additional magnetic components or control circuits. Balancing voltages and accurate intercell energy redistribution are governed by the transformer&#8217;s turns ratio, allowing precise regulation without auxiliary converters or switch matrices. Consequently, the system avoids the multiple receiver coils and complex switching networks typical of conventional WPT equalizers, leading to notable reductions in cost, volume, and control complexity. Furthermore, the topology ensures accurate balancing without stringent coupling consistency and remains stable under coil misalignment, highlighting its robustness to mutual inductance variations. These attributes make the system particularly suitable for dynamic or mobile energy storage applications. Experimental results validate the proposed equalizer, demonstrating a charging efficiency of 81.5% at a 19 W load while maintaining intercell voltage deviations below 0.02 V. These results demonstrate that the proposed method offers a compact, reliable, and scalable approach for integrated battery management in WPT-enabled systems.</description></item><item><title>Data-Based Zero-Phase Angle Frequency Tracking for Series&#8211;Series Compensated WPT Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11174129</link><description>The zero-phase angle (ZPA) operation is a widely used strategy in wireless power transfer (WPT) systems to improve the system efficiency. However, the ZPA frequency could vary in application scenarios such as ship-to-shore power systems, where the transfer distance is disturbed by waves, which could force the self- and mutual inductance of the coupled coils to change. Meanwhile, frequency bifurcation often occurs in tightly coupled WPT systems, leading to multiple ZPA frequencies. In this article, a data-based method is proposed to track one of the ZPA frequencies for a magnetic coupling WPT system with series&#8211;series compensation. The proposed method first tracks in real time the waveform of the inverter output current, i.e., amplitude and frequency, from sampled data; then, based on these quantities, aligns the output voltage and current of the inverter to achieve the ZPA operation. Moreover, convergence of the operation frequency is analyzed, and guidelines to suppress frequency hopping are suggested. The implementation of the proposed method in a digital signal processor with the help of a pulsewidth modulation module has also been discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experiments.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Mechanism- and Data-Driven Joint Parameter Identification for Underwater Wireless Power Transfer Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11185120</link><description>Accurate identification of key parameters is crucial for closed-loop control and system stability in underwater wireless power transfer (UWPT) systems. However, the absence of communication and severe harmonic distortion from eddy currents in sea environments present significant challenges to identification results. This article proposes a hybrid mechanism- and data-driven method for accurate joint identification of mutual inductance and load. First, to resolve the linear dependence and parameter coupling inherent in typical LCC&#8211;S compensated UWPT systems, a multifrequency excitation strategy is introduced to extract informative features for joint identification. Second, an artificial neural network is pretrained on mechanism-based data to construct the source domain model (SDM). Moreover, transfer learning fine-tunes the SDM with limited experimental data to obtain a target domain model (TDM), enhancing model generalization under varying conditions. Finally, an experimental platform with 1 kW/85 kHz is constructed to validate the proposed method. Experimental results and three different typical underwater conditions are captured and collected, which demonstrates that the proposed mechanism and data-driven joint parameter identification method can achieve quick and accurate identification results with prediction error below 3% and response time within 2.72 ms.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Performance Enhancement for Multiexcitation-Units WPT System Using Data-Driven Modeling and Matrix-Inversion-Free Model Predictive Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11197913</link><description>The multiexcitation-units wireless power transfer (MEU-WPT) system supports multilevel power applications by adjusting the number of excitation units. Its inherent redundancy enhances reliability against inverter failures, making it ideal for wireless electric vehicle and underwater vehicle charging. However, the incorporation of the MEU structure increases the number of control variables (such as the phase-shift angles of the inverters) and introduces cross couplings among different power units, resulting in complex power transfer channels and interconnected feedback loops, where variations in one control variable generate disturbances in other channels. Consequently, achieving high dynamic performance in output regulation becomes challenging without effective coordination of all control variables. This article proposes a constrained model predictive control (MPC) method aimed at achieving high dynamic performance in output regulation for the MEU-WPT system with cross couplings. Initially, a data-driven simplified refined instrumental variable method is employed to model the MEU-WPT system, capturing the dynamics associated with the cross couplings. Subsequently, a Laguerre-network based multivariable MPC control law is derived from the data-driven models. A matrix-inversion-free quadratic programming solver is developed to enable computationally-efficient constrained optimization. Furthermore, an event-triggered mechanism is integrated into the control framework, demonstrating the potential for rapid switching between different input power allocations among excitation units. An MEU-WPT prototype featuring two excitation units is constructed to validate the feasibility of the proposed control approach.</description></item><item><title>3-D Wireless Power Transfer With Orthogonal Transmitters and Adaptive MPC-MPPT</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11202560</link><description>This article presents a three-dimensional wireless power transfer system that uses three transmitting coils oriented in orthogonal directions and an adaptive model predictive control (MPC) strategy that incorporates maximum power point tracking (MPPT). The framework combines MPC&#8217;s predictive optimization and MPPT&#8217;s efficiency-seeking behavior, which simultaneously optimizes power tracking accuracy, system efficiency, and current distribution, while maintaining zero-voltage-switching operation. The dynamic weight-adjustment mechanism alters the weights of competing objectives automatically and based on the current operational conditions. The system model indicates that power distribution in 3-D space fits a Lemniscate of Bernoulli surface revolved about its longitudinal axis, so the rotational Lemniscate of Bernoulli surface is important to the control design. The experimental results presented in this article show up to 20% increased efficiency at 40 cm transmission distance, and a peak efficiency of 87% at 60 W and at 40 cm &#215; 40 cm &#215; 40 cm charging volume. The framework provides stable power delivery while the receiver is in motion, making it appealing for applications that require spatial freedom, including mobile robots and bio-inspired aerial vehicles.</description></item><item><title>A M&#246;bius Transformation Impedance Matching Approach for Large Load Region and Multilevel Power Modulation in High Frequency Switched Mode Power Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11207141</link><description>The switched mode power amplifier (PA) is widely used for high frequency high power applications due to its high efficiency. In the switched mode PAs, impedance matching network (IMN) is usually needed to ensure that the varying load impedances can be matched to the target impedances for high efficiency. The existing IMN design methods usually depend on empirical trial and error, load pull simulation, and numerical optimization, which cannot achieve actual region-to-region impedance matching. Therefore, this article proposed a novel impedance matching design approach for switch mode PAs based on the property of circle preservation in M&#246;bius transformation which guarantee that all the impedance points in a region or trajectory can be precisely transferred to the target region or trajectory. The proposed approach gives the simple and explicit formulas to design the IMN parameters, which helps solve the design challenge of accurate impedance matching for large load region. And the impedance matching design for frequency tuning control is also presented to achieve high efficiency and multilevel power modulation over a large impedance region. For verification, a 500 W 13.56 MHz GaN-based class E PA is built and the experiments show that the PA with proposed matching design can achieve 87.2%&#8211;95% efficiency over a large load region. And the high speed pulsing (200 kHz) and multilevel (25.6 kHz) power modulation can be also achieved by frequency tuning with ultra-fast transitions (369 ns) and 91% average efficiency by using the proposed design.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Wireless Power Transfer With Self-Resonance Coupler Based on Integrated Coil</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11208828</link><description>According to the duality of inductive wireless power transfer (IPT) and capacitive wireless power transfer (CPT) in coupler and tuning method, an integrated coil is designed in this article to constructs a compact hybrid wireless power transfer (HPT). The magnetic field coupling and the electric field coupling constructed by coils and plates share one energy transmission channel, which enhances the transmission power and energy density. The inductance of coils and capacitances of plates compensate for each other. The resonant frequency of integrated coils is adjusted to kHz. Additional tuning inductances and capacitances are eliminated to build a lighter self-resonance coupler. The stacked structure design of coils and plates enables compact integration and miniaturization of integrated coils. A 300 W experimental platform was built, and some comparative experiments were conducted. Compared to the coupler of IPT, the self-resonance coupler has improved performance in transmission power, antioffset, and over-coupling suppression. HPT performs better than CPT in transmission distance, transmission power, and transmission efficiency. It has some advantages in the medium-power application scenarios, such as inspection robots and drones, which expect couplers to have a smaller volume, lighter weight, higher power density and better antioffset.</description></item><item><title>Nonpolar Integration for LCC Compensation Inductor in EV-WPT Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11207549</link><description>To reduce the volume of the secondary side of an electric vehicle wireless power transfer system, integrated LCC compensation has become a prevalent approach. However, integrated inductors introduce additional coupling effects among the integrated inductors and the power coils, which may influence the input impedance angle, and increase electrical stresses. To circumvent this problem, this article proposes a nonpolar method for integrated compensation inductor design. The main idea behind the proposed method is to first separate a single compensation inductor into two bipolar inductors, then reconfigure the wirings so that the currents flow in opposite directions, which helps to mitigate their cross interactions. Since this approach decouples the compensation inductors from the power coils, the system becomes more compact and, at the same time, the symmetrical layout results in lower coil current stresses and reduced electromagnetic interference. The universal harmonic-considered time-domain model for vehicle-side magnetic integration is deduced. Furthermore, a systematic comparison of soft-switching behavior between conventional integrated solutions and the proposed topology is carried out under varying misalignment conditions. Experimental results obtained from a 11-kW prototype show that the proposed system achieves zero-voltage switching over the specified misalignment range, with a peak efficiency of 93.4%. A video showing the waveforms of the system during the misalignment process is provided in the Supplementary Material.</description></item><item><title>Pulse Skipping Analysis in Wireless Power Transfer Systems Based on a Reduced-Order Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11216023</link><description>Wireless power transfer (WPT) systems with battery loads exhibit low damping, which results in significant current overshoots and sustained oscillations when subjected to disturbances. Pulse skipping control is frequently employed in WPT systems and can be considered a significant disturbance. However, the accurate analysis of the resulting system dynamics and current envelope remains a challenge. To allow accurate evaluation of the performance of WPT systems with pulse skipping, this article introduces a new reduced-order model for WPT systems through balanced truncation. The derived second-order model enables real-time computation of the current envelopes on both sides of the system, facilitating a comprehensive analysis of the overall performance. This article presents two case studies that utilize this reduced-order model to optimize pulse skipping control in WPT systems. The first study proposes a pulse skipping soft-start strategy based on this model. The second study investigates the optimal pattern of pulse skipping modulations. Simulations and experimental results from a laboratory prototype validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed reduced-order model and the design and refinement of the pulse skipping patterns.</description></item><item><title>Research on an Efficient Noncontact Power Transfer Method for Elliptical Ultrasonic Tool Holders</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11223710</link><description>The elliptical ultrasonic tool holder (EUTH) is a critical core component in elliptical ultrasonic vibration-assisted milling. Traditional EUTH employ conductive slip rings for power transmission, which severely restricts milling speed. This study investigates an efficient noncontact power transfer method for EUTH, utilizing a dual-channel rotary transformer to replace conductive slip rings. Electrical energy is transferred through air coupling between the primary and secondary sides of the rotary transformer, and this frictionless power transmission method eliminates limitations on milling speed. A finite element model of the elliptical ultrasonic transducer was used to analyze its modal shape, impedance, and resonant frequency temperature drift characteristics, thereby determining the transducer's resonant frequency, vibration amplitude, and node positions. The rotary transformer was designed using ferrite core material with high magnetic permeability and low electrical conductivity to reduce eddy current losses. An equivalent circuit model of the EUTH was established, and compensation circuits were designed to improve the efficiency of noncontact power transfer. A dual-channel ultrasonic generator (DCUG) was developed using a Class D amplifier, enabling adjustable voltage amplitude, phase, and frequency. A Fuzzy-PID algorithm was implemented to achieve automatic resonant frequency tracking for the DCUG. Finally, a milling platform was set up to conduct elliptical ultrasonic vibration-assisted milling experiments, where the DCUG drove the EUTH. Experimental results show that below 40 kHz, the maximum driving voltage of the dual-channel ultrasonic generator reaches 300 Vp-p, while the elliptical vibration displacements at the tool tip in the X- and Y-directions are both approximately 20 &#956;mp-p. The output amplitude current remains stable, and the system automatically tracks the resonant frequency of the EUTH during milling. This provides an effective method for achieving high-efficiency noncontact power transfer in EUTH.</description></item><item><title>An Omnidirectional Wireless Power Transfer System via Two Orthogonal Bipolar Coils and Targeting Magnetic Field Control for UAVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11226851</link><description>Misalignment tolerance represents a critical challenge in uncrewed aerial vehicle wireless power transfer (UAV-WPT) systems. Conventional approaches enhance positional and angular misalignment tolerance by generating wide-range omnidirectional magnetic fields through transmitter design or rotating field techniques. However, these methods exhibit a low magnetic field utilization rate since UAVs typically require only specific field orientations postlanding rather than omnidirectional fields. This article proposes a UAV-WPT system employing two orthogonal bipolar transmitting coils with a targeting magnetic field to achieve omnidirectional powering and enhance the magnetic field utilization rate simultaneously. COMSOL simulations are used to analyze the magnetic field distribution of the transmitter, and the principles for generating a targeting magnetic field through excitation current control are explained. The amplitude and phase of the excitation currents are controlled by adjusting the duty cycle and phase difference of the two half-bridge inverters. The mathematical relationships between maximum output power, maximum input power, and maximum transmission efficiency with respect to duty cycle and phase difference are established. A targeting magnetic field control method combining phase difference and duty cycle scanning is proposed. Experimental results show that the system can establish a targeting magnetic field within 85 ms, with a maximum output power of 216.2 W and a peak dc-to-dc efficiency of 89.5%. The dc-to-dc efficiency exceeds 76.1% across &#177;100 mm positional misalignment and arbitrary angular misalignment. The dc-to-dc efficiency of the targeting magnetic field mode is at least 5% higher than that of the rotating magnetic field mode.</description></item><item><title>A Single-Stage Synchronized Switch Interface Circuit for Power Enhancement and Voltage Regulation in Electromagnetic Energy Harvesting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11240585</link><description>Synchronized switch interface circuits demonstrate good performance for electromagnetic energy harvesting applications, but lack adaptability in terms of harvested power. This article introduces an additional control degree of freedom by proposing two power control methods and implementing them in a synchronous current inversion and energy extraction (SCIEE) circuit. Theoretical analysis indicates that the single-stage system achieves higher efficiency for approximately 41.3% of the supported load range compared to using a commercial dc&#8211;dc regulator. In the load transient experiments, the proposed system maintains the output voltage well-regulated, with undershoot and overshoot below 0.2 V. The output voltage ripple is 0.15 V at an 18 mA load current. The proposed system is compared to three other options: a direct ac&#8211;dc harvesting circuit, the synchronous switch energy extraction (SSEE) circuit, and a two-stage harvesting system using a commercial dc&#8211;dc regulator and an open-loop SCIEE circuit. The proposed system supports a maximum load current of 29.47 mA, the highest among these options. In a field test, the proposed system supports successful integrated circuit long range (LoRa) packet transmissions and exhibits a broader supported load range than the SSEE or direct ac&#8211;dc harvest scheme.</description></item><item><title>Constant Current/Voltage Charging Control for Communication-Free IPT Systems via Network-Based Deep Transfer Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11245200</link><description>Parameter identification-based control strategies are considered the preferred solution for achieving constant current (CC) and constant voltage (CV) charging control in communication-free inductive power transfer systems. However, identification errors in mutual inductance, load resistance, and other parameters can affect control accuracy. To improve control accuracy and response speed, a communication-free control strategy based on neural networks and deep transfer learning is proposed. This strategy eliminates the need to identify parameters like mutual inductance and load resistance. Only a few measured datasets are required to train the network model offline, and a trained model can online estimate output voltage/current. By combining with a controller, CV/CC charging control can be achieved under conditions of real-time variations in mutual inductance and load resistance. The experimental results show that the proposed control strategy achieves a static error of only 1.5% and a response time of no more than 24 ms. Compared to the parameter identification-based control strategy, the proposed strategy demonstrates lower static error, shorter response time, and a wider dynamic range.</description></item><item><title>Design of an Anti-Misalignment Coil With Hilbert Structure for WPT System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11249794</link><description>Currently, coil misalignment is recognized as one of the primary factors limiting the transmission efficiency of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, presenting a substantial barrier to the large-scale adoption of WPT. To enhance transmission efficiency under misalignment, mitigate the impacts of misalignment, and increased transmission distance of WPT systems, research on Hilbert fractal curves in related fields was referenced, mutual inductance expressions for coils with Hilbert-extended structures and conventional coils were derived based on their mathematical formulations, and the potential advantages of Hilbert curves in wireless power transfer applications were analyzed. Supported by extensive simulation outcomes, a fractal coil incorporating a Hilbert structure was designed without altering coil manufacturing costs. The transmission performance advantages of this coil were investigated through simulations. A WPT system verification platform utilizing an LCC-S circuit was constructed, where 300 W power and efficiency tests were conducted under relatively consistent zero voltage switch (ZVS) conditions for both coil types. Experimental results across varying transmission distances and misalignment distances were obtained. The results demonstrate that the proposed coils comprehensively optimize the power transfer capability of conventional coils, delivering more stable output power and improving the transmission efficiency by over 10% (up to 24%).</description></item><item><title>Multifrequency and Multiload WPT System Based on Cascade H-Bridge Multilevel Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11251316</link><description>To address the issues of limited output power and harmonic interference in existing multifrequency and multiload magnetic coupling resonant wireless power transfer (MFML-MCR-WPT) systems, this article proposes a MFML-MCR-WPT system based on a cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter (CHB-MLI). The system utilizes the phase disposition multifrequency modulation technique, achieving arbitrary frequency and quantity power output and control through the design of modulation wave quantity, frequency, and amplitude. First, the structure of the CHB-MLI-based MFML-MCR-WPT system is proposed, and the working principle of the multifrequency modulation method is analyzed. Subsequently, a five-level dual-frequency and dual-load system is taken as an example to establish the mathematical model. Then, system parameter optimization is conducted to suppress cross-coupling and interfrequency interference. Furthermore, to address the power and loss imbalance among H-bridge units under multifrequency low modulation indices, a carrier reconstruction method is adopted to balance power distribution and switching losses. Finally, an experimental platform is constructed to validate the proposed theory. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves multilevel multifrequency power output with continuous power and frequency control, maintains minimal interchannel interference, and achieves H-bridge unit balancing ratios of 1:1.19, while exhibiting excellent system compatibility and controllability.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Control of Delta-Connected CHB-Based APQC-ESS for Co-Phase RPS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11215859</link><description>To address the high energy consumption and power quality (PQ) issues in railway power systems (PS), a delta-connected cascaded H-bridge (CHB) based active power quality conditioner integrating energy storage system (APQC-ESS) for co-phase RPS is proposed. First, the operating principles of APQC-ESS for regenerative braking energy (RBE) utilization, reactive power compensation, and negative sequence current (NSC) suppression are analyzed. Then, a multiobjective decoupled control strategy based on sequence component decomposition is developed to achieve independent control of above multiobjectives. On this basis, a collaborative energy management strategy is investigated to enable real-time multiobjective cooperative control for APQC-ESS under fluctuating traction loads. Specifically, the collaborative energy management categorizes RPS operating conditions into two types based on the NSC severity. Subsequently, a three-stage optimization strategy is employed to allocate APQC-ESS capacity to meet various compensation targets, while comprehensively considering capacity limitations and unbalanced power flow within the CHB branches. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed APQC-ESS and its control strategy is validated through experimental results and a filed data case study. The traction energy consumption reduction rate and RBE utilization rate are 26.6% and 27.6% higher than conventional compensation method.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Optimal Proportional-Integral Control (DOC) Strategy Based on Capacitor Energy Balance in Three-Port Rectifier for Low Frequency Pulse Load</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11215829</link><description>The low-frequency pulse load poses a new challenge to the reliability of the power supply system. To adapt to sudden changes in pulse frequency, higher requirements are imposed on the dynamic performance of the converter. The conventional proportional-integral (PI) control cannot simultaneously ensure both excellent dynamic and steady-state performance. The capacitor energy balance control method can achieve high dynamic performance. However, it requires additional output compensation for the converter&#8217;s active current, and its implementation complexity hinders widespread adoption. This article develops an optimized dynamic PI control strategy for three-port rectifiers to address low-frequency pulse load challenges, leveraging capacitor charge balance control (CBC) for enhanced performance. By analyzing the optimal transient trajectories of voltage and current during pulse frequency step changes, the corresponding dynamic controller parameters are prestored based on actual operating conditions. When the pulse frequency changes, rapid active current adjustment within a single pulse cycle is achieved by modifying the outer-loop parameters. This approach maintains the decoupling voltage recovery curve near its optimal trajectory without requiring additional compensation. A three-port rectifier prototype was developed, and experimental results validate both the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed control method.</description></item><item><title>Magnetic Gear-Based Ferrite PM Vernier Generator for a Direct-Drive Wind Turbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11220162</link><description>Nowadays, direct-drive wind generators are becoming popular due to the absence of mechanical gearboxes, noiseless operation, high reliability and less maintenance. Usually, permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) are used for direct-drive wind energy conversion systems due to their high efficiency and voltage regulation. However, the speed of wind turbine blades is generally low, and hence a gear-box is required for grid-connected operation of the generator. Therefore, magnetic geared machines such as flux reversal generators (FRGs) and permanent magnet vernier generators (PMVGs), which have an inherent magnetic gearing effect, low-speed high-torque capability and high torque-to-weight ratio are becoming popular for direct-drive wind generators. In this article, an outer rotor surface-mounted PMVG with ferrite magnets is proposed. A 2-D finite element (FE) analysis is carried-out and the results are presented. In addition, a prototype is fabricated to measure the effectiveness of the proposed generator. Further, experimental validation is carried-out and performance parameters are measured and compared with 2-D FE analysis.</description></item><item><title>Design of Variable Pole Phase Induction Motor Drive With Hybrid Four Quadrant Switch Configuration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11218267</link><description>In electric traction applications, researchers are employing pole phase modulation (PPM) based multiphase induction machines (MIM) to achieve a broader range of speed and torque, allowing for dynamic switching between the various pole phase configurations. The existing literature studies have concentrated more on various inverter topologies for variable pole phase-based induction machines (VPIM). Here, the torque ripple and dc bus voltage utilization (DBVU) issues are tackled with multiple four-quadrant switches along with 3-&#981; SVPWM technology. However, the design of the VPIM drive system w.r.t the converter and machine is crucial, which is not explored in previous studies. This article aims to bridge this gap by describing design considerations of the inverter configuration as well as the motor for VPIM drives. A simple 2-level 9-&#981; inverter with a hybrid four-quadrant switch (HFQS) is proposed for VPIM with phase grouping and isolated neutral techniques. This HFQS is realized with one controllable switch and six power diodes with snubber protection to limit the voltage surges during the transitions from one pole to another pole combination. The design considerations of the dc bus, switch selection for the 9-&#981; inverter, and design of a proposed HFQS are presented in detail. It further presents complete switching loss analysis, conduction loss analysis, and overall inverter as well as motor efficiency. The 3-&#981; carrier-based SVPWM ensures better DBVU, and phase-shifted carriers give the enhanced torque ripple in the high pole mode of a 9-&#981; VPIM drive. The proposed inverter design for a 9-&#981; VPIM has been implemented and validated with Maxwell 2-D, along with Simplorer, and the laboratory prototype of a 5 hp motor.</description></item><item><title>Air-Cooled Coils for Induction Sealing of Large Cylindrical Containers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11217347</link><description>In induction cap sealing, power is transferred to thin Al foil(s) traveling beneath an energized coil-head to create a hermetically sealed bond between the foil and the rim of a plastic/glass container. The distribution of transferred power on foil plays crucial roles for quality of sealing, sealing range, productivity, and energy efficiency. It is particularly difficult to seal moving containers using foils with a large diameter. Achieving desired heat distribution by thermal conduction on a thin foil is difficult. The problem gets aggravated when several large containers reside beneath the coil-head. The effective load resistance could go beyond its limiting value, resulting reduction in coil current. Corresponding reduction in power density in foil could result undersealing. To resolve the problems of sealing continuously fed large-mouth containers (foil diameter &#8805; body diameter), this article proposes a novel coil-head to take care of energy distribution electromagnetically. It achieves sealing of large containers without any feeding constraints and inherently avoids overload condition. The coil enhances the efficiency of energy utilization and productivity. The coil-head is experimentally validated by sealing containers using foils with a diameter range 35&#8211;140 mm. Its superior field distribution is also verified. Even after transferring less power, the foil area sealed/second is drastically increased.</description></item><item><title>Multimicrogrid P2P Energy Trading Benefiting Both Microgrids and the Main Grid Based on a Bi-Level Game</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11215689</link><description>This article proposes a multimicrogrid peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading framework that benefits both microgrids and the main grid.

This article presents the development of a digital twin for a two-stage, single-phase grid-tied inverter system, offering advanced operational benefits. The proposed DT is a mathematically derived model that operates in tandem with the physical system (PS), formulated through intricate equations modeled in the discrete-time domain using the Backward&#8211;Euler method. Sensor data from key positions within the PS serve as the intermediary between the physical and digital system, enabling real-time monitoring and synchronization. An optimized objective function is designed by utilizing sampled data from the PS in conjunction with the results of the mathematical model, ensuring a high-fidelity representation. Key parameters such as the internal resistance and voltage drop of switches, capacitors, and inductors are accurately identified accurately using an adaptive momentum search algorithm (AMSA). Additionally, the AMSA is employed for data analysis, providing an in-depth evaluation of system dynamics. A limit cycle oscillator tuned generalized integrator based d&#8211;q control strategy governs the pulse-width modulation pulses of the inverter, ensuring precise switching and system stability.

The existing dc fault models of CSC either focus on 3-level CSC topology or neglect the transient process and commutation of the converter after fault, not suitable for accurate dc fault analysis of CSC-HVDC. Moreover, the elimination of ac-filters at the point of common coupling (PCC) will lead to severe PCC voltage distortion of weak-grid connected CSC-HVDC after fault. The interaction between the valve-groups caused by the voltage distortion and its influence on the fault characteristics is yet to be studied. In this article, two dc fault analysis models for CSC-HVDC connected to ac grid with different strengths are proposed. Based on quasi-steady state assumptions and substitution theorem, a simplified model by decoupling the valve-groups at the PCC and its adaptability under different grid strengths are proposed for analytical studies of dc fault. For weak-grid connected CSC-HVDC, a fault analysis model is further derived based on the quantitative analysis of the interaction between valve-groups. The proposed models are validated through PSCAD simulations and HIL experiments.</description></item><item><title>Study on an Improved Current Ripple Suppression Algorithm for IPOS SAB DC&#8211;DC Converter System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11220830</link><description>The input-parallel output-series (IPOS) single active bridge (SAB) dc&#8211;dc converter system often suffers from current ripple issues caused by enormous branch power differences due to the location of windward surface and wind turbines in the cascaded dc wind farm.

Existing FTC methods primarily focus on compensating redundant vectors and adjusting dwell times, while neglecting the impact on modeling and control of grid-side currents and neutral-point (NP) voltage under fault conditions. This work formulates a unified fault-induced state space model that facilitates the construction of cost functions in finite-control-set model predictive control (FCS-MPC). The modeling is based on the investigation of the possible cases of single-switch and double-switch open-circuit faults, and the analysis of additional terms introduced by the faults. The proposed FTC method adopts a dual-loop control structure, i.e., the outer loop uses a proportional integral (PI) controller to automatically increase the reference value of the dc bus voltage during vertical faults and converts it into the grid current reference, while the inner loop combines fault-induced grid-side current and NP voltage cost functions in FCS-MPC, adjusting weighting factors based on fault conditions to prioritize grid-side current quality. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed FTC under various open-circuit fault scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Discontinuous Modulation-Based Active Thermal Control for Enhancing the KVA Limit of Grid-Connected Inverter-Based Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11217174</link><description>The kVA limit of a power electronic converter (PEC) is often limited to keep the junction temperature ($T_{j}$) within a safe operating area (SOA). Hence, controlling $T_{j}$ with advanced algorithms such as active thermal control (ATC) methods seems to be a promising way to increase the kVA limit of PEC. In this regard, this article presents a novel closed-loop control approach, combining the discontinuous pulse width modulation (DPWM) strategy with a system-level current controller. The proposed method enables grid-connected inverter-based resources (IBR) to increase their kVA limit without violating the $T_{j}$ limit. This method further allows the converters to operate at a higher ambient temperature ($T_{\rm amb}$) without sacrificing their power handling capacity. An analytical relationship between the bus clamp angle ($\alpha$) with respect to the switching loss ($P_{\rm sw}$) for DPWM has been explained, which is then used as a control variable for the ATC. For the thermal model, a simple Foster thermal model-based temperature estimation method is described, and its accuracy has been depicted.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Control for Multibus Voltage Regulation and Adaptive Reactive Power Sharing in Islanded Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11217313</link><description>In multibus islanded microgrids (IMGs), maintaining all bus voltages within limits while ensuring proper reactive power sharing (RPS) among distributed generators (DGs) presents a significant challenge. To address this challenge, this article presents a distributed control strategy for achieving multibus voltage regulation and adaptive RPS in IMGs. First, we propose a dynamic max/min-consensus algorithm to monitor the real-time voltage range across all buses in a distributed manner. Next, we design a distributed observer to calculate the ideal reactive power reference for each DG. Finally, based on the monitoring of the voltage range, the designed controller ensures that all bus voltages remain within acceptable limits while adjusting each DG&#8217;s output reactive power as close as possible to the reference values. To validate the proposed strategy, we set up IMG systems of different scales using both the hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental platform and the MATLAB/Simulink simulation environment for comprehensive testing. The results show that the proposed strategy effectively regulates all bus voltages within the target range while achieving adaptive RPS, whereas existing methods cause some bus voltages to violate limits.</description></item><item><title>Reinforcement Learning Based Active Model Variation Deadbeat Control for Energy Storage System in DC Microgrids With Constant Power Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11216350</link><description>The issues of constant power load (CPL) and model mismatch lead to significant current ripples and voltage fluctuations in dc microgrids, presenting a substantial challenge for the control methods of energy storage systems. To address these issues, this article proposes a reinforcement learning based active model variation deadbeat control (RL-AMVDB), which adjusts a few control model parameters in the current control loop. The model variation factors and the states of closed-loop system are formulated as a Markov decision process, allowing the model variation factors to be optimized through RL. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated through both simulation and hardware experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces current ripple by 16.6% under model mismatch conditions. Additionally, under sudden CPL changes, the settling time, voltage fluctuations, and current ripple are reduced by 38.4%, 10.2%, and 12.5%&#8211;20%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Simple and Efficient Direct Predictive Control Framework for Multiparallel Power Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11218625</link><description>Parallel connection of power converters is a widely adopted approach to increase power capacity and enhance fault tolerance. This article presents a simple and efficient direct predictive control framework for multiparallel two-level and three-level neutral-point-clamped converters. By using the number of available switching states as control variables, rather than the switching states themselves, the candidate set is reduced to no more than four, significantly lowering the computational burden and enhancing scalability. Additionally, a novel current sorting method is introduced to suppress circulating currents independently, allowing more flexibility for output current and voltage balancing optimization. Both simulation and experimental results validate its effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Virtual Bus Strategy for Electrolytic Capacitorless DAB Microinverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11220219</link><description>In residential photovoltaic (PV) systems, microinverters link the PV panels to the ac bus. Conventionally, these microinverters incorporate a stable dc bus that relies on bulky and unreliable electrolytic capacitors. To improve, we propose an adaptive virtual bus strategy for DAB microinverter, which removes the electrolytic capacitors. The microinverter features a quasi-single-stage design interconnected by a virtual bus, which exhibits a notable double-line-frequency voltage ripple. The front-end employs a boost converter to elevate the low PV voltage and regulate the voltage of the virtual bus. The back-end utilizes a dual-active-bridge (DAB) inverter to transform the oscillating virtual bus voltage into the desired ac output. This architecture facilitates active power decoupling (APD) for enhanced power density by buffering mismatched power on the minimized bus capacitors and dynamically adjusting the operational state of the DAB inverter. Furthermore, by decoupling the control algorithms of the two parts, we reduce the number of required voltage and current sensors, thereby simplifying the overall control system. To validate the concept, a GaN-based prototype rated at 200 W and 600 kHz maximum is designed and tested. This prototype achieved a peak efficiency of 92.67%.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Aware Adaptive Force-Admittance Control for Robotic Manipulators: Application in High-Precision Aircraft Assembly</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11217341</link><description>An energy-aware adaptive force-admittance control strategy is proposed, which integrates accurate force regulation through a direct force controller with compliant motion enabled by adaptive admittance control. This combined mechanism addresses environmental uncertainties while simultaneously regulating wrench and position. However, the admittance adaptation and direct force controller introduce nonpassive behaviors, undermining the system&#8217;s passivity. To resolve this issue, a virtual energy tank is introduced to monitor the energy associated with nonpassive actions, ensuring energy boundedness and restoring system passivity for stable interaction with passive environments. To further enhance safety and performance, the proposed scheme incorporates online energy injection and freezing mechanisms. When the tank&#8217;s energy level falls below a preset threshold, additional energy is injected to improve control performance. Conversely, when the exerted wrench exceeds specified limits, the control system reverts to a constant admittance model to maintain compliance, effectively freezing any additional energy extraction. Two activation functions are also developed to ensure precise positioning in the direction of position control. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through real industrial robot applications in aircraft assembly tasks. Experimental results demonstrate its superiority in improving both task performance and operational safety.</description></item><item><title>Minimum-Spacing Optimized Winding Switching Control for Winding-Segmented PMLSM With Multiple Movers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11220838</link><description>The winding-segmented permanent magnet linear synchronous motor (WS-PMLSM) system adopts a modular mover-stator topology, offering advantages such as high load capacity and high-precision positioning. Traditional strategy typically employs a synchronous current drive method for dual-stator units, which mandates the minimum spacing of multiple movers exceeding the length of two stator units. To minimize the spacing constraints between the movers, this article proposes an optimized stator winding switching control strategy based on single/dual-stator winding drive modes. First, an analytical electromagnetic thrust model of WS-PMLSM is established based on the magnetic energy principle. Second, for the single-stator winding drive mode, a current feedforward control strategy is proposed to compensate for the electromagnetic force disturbance between adjacent segments. Furthermore, based on the coupling length between the mover and stator windings, an optimized winding switching strategy with linear transition switching method is proposed to reduce the thrust ripple. Finally, a WS-PMLSM experimental platform is built to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Model-Free Energy Flow Regulation Passivity-Based Control for Robotic Rotary Joints With Data-Driven Surrogate Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11215801</link><description>Passivity-based control (PBC) is a powerful control strategy, excelling in stability through its energy-based framework. It is regarded as an effective method for enhancing the dependability of robotic rotary joints (RRJs). However, as a fundamentally model-based control method, PBC&#8217;s effectiveness heavily relies on accurate system modeling and parameter estimation. Consequently, its control performance is significantly degraded in RRJs, which exhibit complex nonlinear dynamics complicate parameter identification and frequently lead to parameter mismatches between theoretical models and physical systems. To address this limitation, this article presents a novel energy flow regulation-PBC (EFR-PBC) methodology. Leveraging the system&#8217;s polynomial characteristics, EFR-PBC incorporates a data-driven recursive polynomial response surface (RPRS) surrogate model to predict energy flow tensor (EFT) variations from input-output measurements, facilitating adaptive control law synthesis. By reducing dependence on precise mathematical models and system parameters, EFR-PBC maintains robust performance under uncertain conditions. Extensive comparative studies through both numerical simulations and experimental validations against conventional interconnection and damping assignment (IDA)-PBC and PID-PBC implementations demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Variable Symmetry Constraints-Based Stability Analysis of Large Delayed Cyber-Physical Power System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11216358</link><description>Linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based delay-dependent stability analysis methods have been effectively utilized in the delayed cyber-physical power system (DCPPS). However, the significant computational burden associated with solving large-scale LMIs presents a substantial challenge when these methods are applied to real-world power systems. This article investigates an efficient evaluation method for the delay-dependent stability of the large DCPPS by presenting a variable symmetry constraints-based approach. First, by exploring the highly symmetric characteristics of control loops and renewable energy sources (RES), this article gives new structure restrictions for the weighting matrices required in the LMI-based stability criterion to reduce the number of decision variables (NDVs). In contrast, the existing methods focus only on the symmetric characteristics of traditional generators and are not applicable to large DCPPS integrated with the RES. Then, by introducing an adjustable parameter into the proposed structure restrictions, the approach based on variable symmetry constraints is established to bridge the gap where the existing constant methods fail to address the variable stability conditions. Moreover, the proposed variable symmetry constraints-based approach is more relaxed than the existing method since it keeps the NDVs in the LMIs unchanged despite massive generators equipped in the same control area of the DCPPS. Case studies are based on the large DCPPS with illustration of the load frequency control (LFC) schemes and the 39-Bus New England System to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. The proposed method is verified to be available to analyze the delay-dependent stability of the large-scale DCPPS efficiently while guaranteeing the computation accuracy.</description></item><item><title>High-Precision Nonlinear Spatial Gradient Disturbance Suppression Method for Magnetic Shielding Cylinder</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11220881</link><description>High-power devices used in hospitals generate harmonic magnetic field disturbances inside magnetic shielding cylinders (MSCs). These disturbances exhibit axial-gradient spatial distributions, which substantially degrade the imaging quality of magnetocardiography (MCG). To address this issue, a high-precision nonlinear spatial gradient disturbance suppression method is proposed for single-open MSCs. First, a nonlinear gradient coil design is developed to generate variable magnetic field gradients, precisely matching the nonlinear gradient distribution induced by external magnetic disturbances in the MSC. Subsequently, the entire system is modeled, and a composite controller based on proportional-integral repetitive control-linear extended state observer (PIRC-LESO) is designed to enhance the suppression of magnetic field disturbances with harmonic characteristics. Finally, an active magnetic field disturbance suppression system was implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of the nonlinear spatial gradient disturbance suppression method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the peak-to-peak magnetic field disturbance from 42.0 to 6.9 pT and significantly enhances the signal-to-noise ratio of the MCG signals.</description></item><item><title>Revisit Windup Phenomenon in Grid-Forming Inverters With Priority Current Limiter: A Physical Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11220825</link><description>This article investigates the windup phenomenon of grid-forming (GFM) inverters with priority current limiters (PCL). It is found that a crucial transitional stage exists in both the PCL triggering and exit processes, which significantly impacts the windup issue. By analyzing the phasor diagrams and power-angle curves of the GFM inverter, it is revealed that the fault clearance angle and switching angle between the transitional stage and stable stage in current-limiting mode jointly determine the existence of windup after fault clearance. A criterion is developed based on these findings. Further, four distinct scenarios are examined in light of this criterion and transitional stage. A practical antiwindup control method based on the criterion is proposed. Finally, the theoretical findings are demonstrated through experiments.</description></item><item><title>DC Link Capacitance Minimizing Set of Type-II Voltage Controller Coefficients for PFC Rectifiers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11217337</link><description>The brief presents a method for deriving a type-II voltage controller coefficients set allowing to minimize the dc link capacitance in single-phase active power factor correction rectifiers (PFCR) operating without hold-up time requirements.

However, due to the fact that the load transient response of HHB circuit depends on the IGBT branch with lower switching frequency, the system load transient response is poor. To overcome this issue, an active ripple suppression technique based on digital dead-beat average current (DBAC) control and load current feed-forward for both IGBT branch and GaN branch in the HHB circuit is proposed in this letter. The operating principle and control law of proposed control for the HHB circuit in FPP mode are analyzed in detail. The load transient performance of the HHB circuit is further investigated. Finally, experimental results of the active ripple suppression technique for the IGBT and GaN HHB circuit are provided to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Interpretable Wind Power Forecasting With Feature and Loss Function Construction Guided by Domain Knowledge</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11122909</link><description>Current wind power forecasting (WPF) methods predominantly rely on data-driven deep learning models, inherently lacking integration of domain knowledge, which limits forecasting accuracy and model interpretability. To address this issue, an interpretable data-knowledge fusion ultra-short-term WPF model is proposed, in which domain knowledge guides the feature construction process and is directly embedded into the design of the loss function. In the feature construction module, a wind speed-power curve is established to generate theoretical power outputs by using historical wind speed as inputs. These theoretical outputs, combined with historical measured data, serve as inputs for the model. In the loss function construction module, a boundary constraint loss is designed by extracting the upper and lower boundaries of wind power output using the alpha shape algorithm and Local Weighted Linear Regression based on wind speed and power data. Notably, the parameters of boundaries are dynamically updated to capture the volatility of wind power. Additionally, an error distribution shape loss is introduced to penalize the deviation of the training error distribution from the normal distribution, using Jensen-Shannon divergence as an indicator. Case studies across 30 wind farms demonstrate that the proposed method guided by interpretable knowledge achieves the best average performance across all time horizons compared to baseline models. The method also shows strong robustness in noise and missing data experiments.</description></item><item><title>Novel Unified Control Framework for Networked RES-BES Microgrids With Enhanced Performance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11120450</link><description>The increasing deployment of renewable energy sources (RESs) facilitates the interconnection of distributed energy networks, thereby maximizing the utilization of the unevenly distributed RESs. Networked hybrid ac/dc microgrids enable regional multi-terminal networks at end-user sites, offering plug-and-play integration for RESs and battery energy storage systems (BESs) through synergistic ac/dc complementarity. However, this interconnected configuration introduces increased complexity in control strategies and poses significant power management challenges for RES-BES microgrids, as sudden RES fluctuations demand system-wide BES compensation to prevent local overloads. This paper proposes a unified droop control-based framework for networked hybrid microgrids comprising RESs, BESs and loads. The proposed approach enables seamless transitions between operational modes, proportional power sharing, and enhanced operation without circulating currents or overstressing components. Furthermore, it inherently addresses abrupt source failures and asymmetric line faults without requiring adjustments in the primary control methods, ensuring uninterrupted maximum power harvest of RESs. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through case studies using real-time simulation platform Typhoon-HIL.</description></item><item><title>Time-Varying Inertia Characterization of DFIG-Based Wind Turbines for Power System Frequency Dynamic Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11113495</link><description>Accurately assessing the inertial response of renewable energy generation (REG) is critical for frequency stability. However, REG represented by doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine (WT) exhibits inherent time-varying inertia behavior, fundamentally distinct from synchronous generators (SGs). Prevailing inertia assessment methods predominantly rely on SG-derived time-domain inertia constants, which cannot capture this intrinsic variability. Consequently, the rationality of directly applying these conventional methods to DFIG-based WT lacks theoretical justification. To address this gap, this paper derives an expression for calculating time-varying inertia using the angular momentum theorem. Results demonstrate that inertia in the time domain dynamically varies with disturbances, highlighting the significant limitations of conventional inertia descriptions. Alternatively, a frequency-domain inertia characterization method is investigated to provide a disturbance-independent description of inertia, effectively capturing its intrinsic time-varying nature. Due to the duality between time and frequency domains, this paper mathematically describes the relationship between frequency-domain inertia and time-domain inertia, explicitly clarifying the physical meaning of inertia in the frequency domain. Simulations on an IEEE 39-bus system verify that the frequency-domain inertia method accurately captures inertia dynamics and is suitable for frequency stability analysis. These findings emphasize frequency-domain inertia characterization as an essential method for representing inertia in renewable-rich power systems.</description></item><item><title>Wind Turbulence-Induced Power Fluctuations Mitigation in PMSG-Based Wind Turbines by a Coordinated Control Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106269</link><description>Power fluctuations in large-scale wind turbines (WTs), induced by persistent wind turbulences, can degrade the reliability of power modules and increase mechanical stress on light-strength structural components. These issues entail intricate challenges for system operators in terms of operation and maintenance. This paper investigates specifications of power fluctuations in PMSG-based WTs and presents a control scheme advantageous both below and above the rated wind speed, without requiring additional energy storage devices. This work strives to bridge the gap between the complicated art of WT modeling and wind turbulence-induced power fluctuations aiming to reveal the origin of power fluctuations in terms of operating regions and control strategies. In the proposed control scheme, the power fluctuations are mitigated without any auxiliary control terms below the nominal wind speed. Above the nominal wind speed, the power smoothing action is performed via three items, in which the machine side converter (MSC) virtually regulates the rotor inertia, the grid side converter (GSC) exerts the damping component, and the pitch control system helps enhance the damping mechanism. The feedback gains of the auxiliary terms are optimized while considering their interactions. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed control scheme effectively mitigates both the electrical and mechanical oscillations.</description></item><item><title>Incorporating Frequency Security Constraints in Two-Stage Robust Unit Commitment of Integrated Transmission and Distribution System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11098731</link><description>With the integration of high-proportion renewable energies, the independent operation of the transmission and distribution systems (T&amp;amp;DSs) makes it difficult to achieve optimal scheduling and ensure frequency security. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-stage robust frequency-constrained unit commitment (TRO-FCUC) model of T&amp;amp;DS. Firstly, the impacts of distributed energy resources (DERs) frequency regulation capabilities on inertial response and primary frequency response (PFR) are considered, and dynamic frequency constraints considering the cooperation of thermal units, wind farms, and DERs with their inertia-based frequency reserve are constructed. Then, the TRO-FCUC model is formulated to address uncertainties of wind farms (WFs) and distributed photovoltaics (DPVs) based on uncertainty sets. Further, the column and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) algorithm and strong duality theory are utilized to transform the TRO-FCUC model into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model and then solve it iteratively. Finally, case analyses proposed demonstrate that the coordinated operation of T&amp;amp;DS can fully mobilize the frequency regulation potential of DERs and improve the operation&#8217;s economy while ensuring the frequency security of the system.</description></item><item><title>Novel Series-Isolated-Parallel Wind Farm DC Collection System With New Control Strategies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11105057</link><description>Offshore wind farm (WF) DC collection systems offer significant reductions in weight and size compared to conventional AC systems. Among DC architectures, the series-parallel wind farm (SP-WF) configuration achieves higher efficiency by reducing the number of power conversion stages. However, because SP-WF places the DC-DC converter upstream of the series connection of wind turbines (WTs), it suffers from reduced reliability due to its vulnerability to DC short-circuit faults within the series string. This paper proposes a novel series-isolated-parallel wind farm (SIP-WF) architecture that enhances reliability by integrating a DC-DC converter to isolate each group of series-connected WTs. This isolation provides intrinsic DC fault blocking capability without the need for external DC circuit breakers. Furthermore, as only passive rectifiers are used at each individual WT, the proposed SIP-WF architecture maintains high efficiency. To manage maximum power point tracking (MPPT) across turbines experiencing different wind conditions, two new centralized control strategies are proposed to coordinate multiple WTs using a single DC-DC converter per group. The proposed SIP-WF architecture and control strategies are validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. A comprehensive performance comparison is conducted against existing DC collection topologies. The results demonstrate that SIP-WF achieves a higher net energy yield while reducing cost, system weight, and volume, and offering superior fault tolerance compared to conventional architectures.</description></item><item><title>Fault Ride-Through Strategy for Grid-Forming Converters Satisfying Multi-Objective Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11091548</link><description>Transient synchronization stability (TSS), current limitation and reactive power support (RPS) are the key objectives for fault ride-through (FRT) that grid-forming converters (GFMCs) must satisfy. However, the complex coupling restraints among these objectives, along with the fact that GFMC cannot directly control current due to its voltage-source nature, present significant challenges for FRT. To address these issues, this paper first analyzes the coupling relationships among the three objectives, and reveals the formations and control mechanisms of phase current, reactive current, and fault inrush current in GFMC. Inspired these insights, an adaptive FRT strategy is designed by cooperatively adjusting the active power and voltage references, as well as the adaptive virtual resistance, which satisfies FRT multi-objective constraints even if the voltage sags to 0. And it is straightforward to implement. Furthermore, the proposed FRT strategy is shown to exhibit superior TSS and RPS performance, as demonstrated through region of attraction and voltage phase portraits. Finally, simulation and experiment results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed FRT strategy.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability Analysis of MMC-HVDC Connected DFIG-Based Wind Farms in the Electromechanical Timescale</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106276</link><description>This paper investigates the transient stability of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farms connected via a modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission system in the electromechanical timescale. During faults, the MMC tends to be switched to the current-limiting mode, which further interacts with the control systems of DFIG-based wind farms, thereby complicating the transient stability problem. In this paper, a large-signal model is constructed for transient stability analysis under this condition. The transient stability mechanism is revealed, and a transient stability index that considers the impact of a phase-locked loop in the electromechanical timescale is derived. The proposed index quantitatively assesses the instability risk arising from the coupled interaction between the DFIG-based wind farms and the MMC. In addition, the impacts of the current- limiting mode and other parameters (i.e., speed control loop gains, rotor shaft damping, inertia coefficient and fault location and severity) are analyzed. Based on the results of the parametric analysis, a suite of targeted countermeasures is proposed to enhance the transient stability of the power system. Finally, a theoretical analysis is demonstrated and verified through hardware-in-the-loop simulations using the Modeling Tech microgrid real-time simulation platform.</description></item><item><title>A Quantitative Accommodation Guaranteed Robust Scheduling Method for Renewable Power System With Dynamic Uncertainty Set</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11090046</link><description>Wind power generation (WPG) has been increasingly integrated into power systems to reduce carbon emissions. However, its inherent volatility and stochasticity have significantly challenged the reliable system operation and effective accommodation. In this paper, a robust scheduling method with a quantitative accommodation guarantee for power systems with WPG integration is proposed. First, a dynamic uncertainty set (DUS) of WPG is introduced, and a stochastic accommodation rate (SAR) indicator is accordingly proposed and derived to quantify the attainable accommodation level. Based on the DUS, a robust scheduling method is proposed, in which the implicit affine strategy (IAS) is adapted to guarantee the nonanticipativity of scheduling strategies. Moreover, a SAR constraint is carefully built according to the assessment result of the power system&#8217;s maximal and minimal SAR and embedded into the scheduling model to provide a quantitative accommodation guarantee. An illustrative case is presented to validate the effectiveness of the SAR indicator. Numerical simulations in the modified 6-bus, 14-bus, and 118-bus power systems validate the superiority of the proposed scheduling method.</description></item><item><title>Current Control and DC Capacitor Dynamic Interaction in a Cross-Timescale Manner in DFIG-WT Dominated Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11088231</link><description>The Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) based wind turbine (WT) contains control loops and energy storage components operating across multiple timescales, leading to potential cross-timescale influence dynamics in DFIG-WT-dominated power systems. Previous analyses have primarily focused on single timescale dynamics or the interactions between control loops at different timescales, with limited attention given to the cross-timescale influences between control loops and energy storage components. This paper aims to reveal the cross-timescale influence mechanism of current control at the AC-current-control timescale on the dynamics of the DC capacitor at the DC-voltage-control timescale. Modal analysis is a mature method used to uncover the cross-timescale influence phenomena and laws of current control on the dynamics of the DC capacitor. Subsequently, an equivalent circuit model is established to analyze the mechanism by which current control affects the dynamics of the DC capacitor. Finally, the conclusions are validated through simulations based on a four-machine two-area power system and the power grid of Northwest China.</description></item><item><title>Rapid Active Power Regulation of Distributed Photovoltaics Based on Optimal Dynamic Droop Coefficients</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11095309</link><description>To realize the active response for rapid active power regulation of massive distributed photovoltaics (DPVs), a bi-level architecture integrating clustering and optimization is proposed for the coordinated design of dynamic droop coefficients of DPVs in this paper.

At the upper level, a frequency deviation-optimal droop coefficient model incorporating the regulation performance and network losses is developed in a perspective that considers power flow impacts. The droop coefficient regulation strategy under various frequency fluctuations is pre-calculated by a graph attention network (GAT).

Model predictive control (MPC) is the mainstream EMS for HESSs, as it typically yields a control solution close to the global optimum while satisfying constraints. However, MPC faces a high computational burden when the optimal control problem is nonlinear. More importantly, considering multiple competing objectives, tuning weighting factors (WFs) in the MPC cost function is also challenging. To tackle these challenges, this article proposes a learning-augmented MPC strategy to optimize energy management for the HESS in WECs. The strategy first utilizes a fuzzy logic-based asymmetric action trimming technique to reduce MPC computational time. Further, a warm-start Q-learning (QL) framework with high learning efficiency is applied to obtain the WF online tuning method. To bridge the simulation-to-reality gap in the QL framework, the article designs a neural network-based current predictor, aiming to sense the nonlinear power loss during power conversion. Finally, simulations and experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed strategy in reducing energy loss, battery degradation, and MPC computational burden.</description></item><item><title>Spatio-Temporal Probabilistic Forecasting of Wind Speed Using Transformer-Based Diffusion Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11091547</link><description>Spatio-temporal wind speed forecasting plays a crucial role in enhancing energy conversion efficiency and optimizing resource allocation, forming a cornerstone of sustainable development. However, existing methods for spatio-temporal wind speed forecasting face challenges in capturing intricate spatio-temporal dependencies and adapting to dynamic variations in wind speed data. To address these limitations, we propose the Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Transformer (PSTDT), a novel model that combines the generative power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models with the robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities of Transformers. This approach introduces a dual-spatial attention module to model static positional relationships and dynamic dependencies from historical data, thereby capturing evolving spatial correlations. Additionally, PSTDT integrates a dual-phase temporal module for modeling cross-period temporal dependencies alongside auto-regressive temporal features, enhancing its capacity to address the complexities of time-series forecasting. Furthermore, a temporal-adaptive layer normalization is incorporated to dynamically adjust normalization parameters, improving the model&#8217;s forecast accuracy and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PSTDT outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, reducing continuous ranked probability score by 8% &#8211;20% and mean absolute error by 7% &#8211;19% .</description></item><item><title>End-to-End Collaborative Optimization for Active Distribution Network Power Dispatch Based on Sparse Model-Ensemble Learning Policy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119768</link><description>With the higher penetration of distributed renewable power sources, novel active distribution networks are increasingly implementing flexible adjustment strategies. Currently, the dual uncertainties from both sources and demand significantly affect power dispatch in distribution networks. Typically, power dispatch is performed using a predict-then-optimize approach, making it challenging to quantify the gap between the real-time and theoretically optimal dispatch performances due to inaccuracies in power predictions. Hence, this study introduces a novel end-to-end policy to solve a collaborative optimization between prediction and dispatch. The policy directly utilizes all available information, such as gridded numerical weather forecasts, for dispatch decision-making, which eliminates the need for power predictions as intermediate variables for dispatch. To address the challenges of high-dimensional and open-scenario model training in end-to-end policies, sparse model-ensemble learning is proposed to formulate the dispatch policy model. The model is solved using constrained policy optimization. Comparative studies show that the proposed end-to-end policy outperforms the predict-then-optimize policy in real-time dispatch cases involving photovoltaic reactive power ancillary service and demand response within distribution networks.</description></item><item><title>LPV Model Predictive Control for Offshore Wind Farms Considering Wake Delay Characteristics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082107</link><description>The pronounced wake effect in large-scale offshore wind farm necessitates careful consideration of its delay characteristics, which are crucial yet often overlooked in control. Addressing the coupling between the dynamic evolution of wake effects and the parameter changes of the WT control model, this paper introduces a Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) model predictive control method that considers wake delay characteristics. Through the development of a quasi-steady state wake model, the wake delay characteristic is incorporated within an LPV model for the wind farm. A two-stage dimensionality reduction method is proposed to simplify the calculation, and a model predictive control (MPC) method is combined to optimize the fatigue damage balance and power generation enhancement in the wind farm coordinately. Simulation results from a wind farm consisting of 16 wind turbines validate the efficacy of the quasi-steady state wake model in depicting the spatial distribution of wake delays. Furthermore, in dynamically varying wind speed and directions scenarios, the proposed control method can effectively capture the wind speed delay and fluctuation characteristics between different wind turbines, leading to heightening power output and diminishing fatigue stresses. Notably, in comparison to the static model control, the adaptive parameter tuning mechanism inherent in the proposed method effectively curtails control overshoot, enhancing overall system performance.</description></item><item><title>Fast Frequency Response in Low Inertia Grids via Integrated Supercapacitor Energy Storage Systems and Wind Turbine Generators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082652</link><description>The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources in modern power systems has led to a significant reduction in system inertia, creating challenges for maintaining grid frequency stability. To address these issues, a new ancillary service market, termed &#8220;Fast Frequency Response (FFR)&#8221;, has emerged. FFR mandates rapid power delivery from renewable energy sources,including wind power systems, immediately following contingency events to alleviate frequency drops in a few seconds. This paper presents a control method combining supercapacitor energy storage systems and wind turbine generators to enhance the FFR capabilities of wind power systems and mitigate the frequency drop. This approach ensures the readiness of supercapacitor energy storage systems to provide FFR services under diverse wind conditions. Additionally, a control scheme for the wind turbine generator is developed to optimize its participation in FFR across a range of wind speeds while maintaining a stable operation of the wind power system. The results demonstrate that, while preserving an equivalent investment cost to that of supercapacitor banks, wind power systems can significantly increase their FFR contributions. This improvement effectively addresses critical frequency stability challenges in low-inertia grids. Eventually, the proposed method is validated through real-time experiments on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) setup.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Evolution and Stability Analysis of GFM-Based Renewable Energy Resources Considering Repeated &amp; Continuous Current Saturation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079878</link><description>The current saturation (CS) strategy of grid-forming renewable energy sources (GFM-RESs) is designed to protect the device from overcurrent damages. However, the potential switching processes of control strategies trigger new stability issues. It is revealed that two emerging stability issues, i.e., repeated current saturation (R-CS) and continuous current saturation (C-CS) governed by the inherent inconsistency of switching conditions, will occur when the system operates into the corresponding virtual power angle (VPA) region. This paper adopts the hybrid system theory to analyze such stability issues by deriving the necessary and sufficient switching conditions of current saturation and desaturation. During R-CS, the GFM-RES externally behaves as an abnormal current source, triggering adverse high-frequency oscillations. When subject to C-CS, the system will suffer from persistent overvoltage issues and cannot return to its initial operating point. To identify the stability risks of these two issues and offer guidance for GFM-RES&#8217;s controller design, a novel R&amp;amp;C-CS criterion, along with a generic desaturation region-based (DRB) principle, is proposed. Meanwhile, a switching condition and dynamic characteristic decoupling control (S&amp;amp;D-DC) is developed based on the DRB principle to prevent the R&amp;amp;C-CS issues. High-fidelity electromagnetic transient simulations conducted on both single-machine and multi-machine systems validate the theoretical derivations and proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Interpretable Augmented Ambiguity Set for Quantifying Regional Wind Power Uncertainty in Distributionally Robust Optimal Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082100</link><description>A large-scale grid penetration of wind power has posed severe uncertainty challenges for power system operation. This paper comes up with an interpretable augmented ambiguity set assisted by deep learning for two-stage economic dispatch formulated in a distributionally robust optimization, aiming at precisely representing regional wind power uncertainty. The specifically designed augmented ambiguity set is driven by both the fine-grained uncertainty model of each wind farm and interactive dependencies among different sites. In particular, a multi-teacher knowledge distillation-time generative adversarial network (MKD-time GAN) is presented for the first time to form a spherical ambiguity set gathering all possible distributions for power prediction error of single wind farm. This model leverages a cascaded learning framework by typical teacher-time GANs to jointly educate one general student-time GAN so as to induce a family of comprehensive reference distributions as an ambiguity set. Further, multiple ambiguity sets are mapped into augmented ambiguity set, an interdependent joint probability distribution space for regional prediction error by Nataf transformation. Based on that, a tractable solution algorithm of two-stage optimal dispatch is explicitly derived and saves computation scale. The benefits of both novel MKD-time GAN and decision-making dispatch schemes are demonstrated in IEEE 118-bus systems.</description></item><item><title>Tri-layer Distributed Scheduling for Coastal Integrated Transmission-Distribution-Gas System With Uncertain Typhoons-Affected Offshore Wind Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11075623</link><description>This paper addresses the scheduling challenges associated with offshore wind power within coastal power systems during uncertain typhoons. The proposed tri-layer chance-constrained coordinated scheduling model differs from existing formulations through two major innovations. First, unlike the deterministic scheduling under forecasted typhoons, it implements a scenario-based stochastic programming to address the wind power deviations resulting from the typhoon uncertainties, while additionally factoring in the potential damage to wind turbines. Second, moving beyond the isolated scheduling of thermal units in the transmission network, the proposed model enables a distributed coordination of diverse flexible resources across the distribution and gas networks to mitigate typhoon damage, resulting in a more complex tri-layer scheduling framework. These advancements introduce marked challenges for model solution. To handle this, a mix-sample average approximation method is introduced to reformulate the original random variables involved model into a tractable linear form. Moreover, a novel efficient distributed solution methodology is proposed to tackle the specific nested interactions within the tri-layer scheduling framework. Case studies verify the economic and reliability advantages of the proposed model, with 20.2% average cost saving and over 90% decrease in imbalanced power, as well as the computational superiority of the proposed distributed solution for significantly reduced solution time.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Stage Ultra-Short-Term Wind Power Forecasting Method Based on Transitional Weather Identification and Meteorological Prediction Error Propagation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11078806</link><description>Accurate and reliable wind power forecasting is crucial for the safe and economical operation of power systems. However, under transitional weather conditions, the forecasting errors of meteorological variables such as wind speed tend to increase, introducing significant input noise into wind power prediction models and reducing their reliability. To address this, this paper focuses on analyzing the error propagation mechanism of meteorological input variables and proposes a strategy to improve short-term wind power forecasting accuracy under transitional weather conditions. First, transitional weather periods are identified by analyzing the fluctuation characteristics of multi-dimensional meteorological variables. Then, a two-stage model combining Sparse Variational Gaussian Process (SVGP) and Noisy Input Gaussian Process (NIGP) is proposed. In this model, noisy input data (wind speed predictions) are decomposed into true data (actual wind speed) and noise data (forecast errors), which are modeled independently. By considering the propagation process of input noise in wind power forecasting and making necessary corrections, the SVGP-NIGP model provides more accurate deterministic forecasts and higher-quality interval predictions. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly enhances wind power forecasting accuracy under transitional weather conditions, offering an effective solution to address the uncertainties arising from meteorological forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Self-Optimizing Local Voltage Control of SOP in Active Distribution Networks Based on Lift-Dimension Mapping Linearization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11072306</link><description>The high penetration of distributed generators (DGs) deteriorates the voltage violations in active distribution networks (ADNs). Owing to the flexible adjustment capacity, the local power regulation provided by soft open point (SOP) presents a promising solution for eliminating voltage violations in ADNs. A data-driven local control method can fully excavate the potential logic from operational data without requiring precious network parameters. However, the training data may be insufficient in practical applications. In this paper, a self-optimizing local voltage control method for SOP is proposed to achieve adaptive control in label-poor conditions. First, a SOP local control model is constructed based on lift-dimension mapping linearization (LDML), which portrays the complex relationship between ADN states and SOP control strategies. Subsequently, a self-optimizing guidance mechanism is established to obtain the label data of SOP control strategy, which provides a large number of training samples for the local control model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using a practical distribution network with a four-terminal SOP. Results demonstrate that efficient control strategies can be determined based on local state measurements. A rapid response to DG fluctuations can be achieved while enhancing the adaptability to variations in practical operations.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Optimized Parameter Tuning Algorithm for Wind Turbine Grid-Forming Control to Mitigate Power Oscillations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11068198</link><description>As the transition from synchronous generators (SGs) to renewable energy sources (RESs) accelerates, grid forming wind turbines (GFM-WTs) are increasingly expected to play a critical role in maintaining power system stability. However, the integration of GFM without thoroughly considering the interaction between the outer and inner control loops can induce power oscillations. Therefore, this paper offers a systematic sensitivity analysis to explicitly reveal how the control parameters contribute to power oscillations in the GFM-WT system. This analysis is based on a linearized state-space model for the GFM-WT system, incorporating comprehensive system dynamics and control strategies. Furthermore, an optimized control algorithm is developed based on a comprehensive small-signal model, incorporating essential constraints such as the eigenvalue damping ratio and the control loop bandwidth. The algorithm autonomously tunes the control parameters of both the inner and outer loop systems, resulting in optimal parameter values. A comprehensive stability analysis was conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in ensuring system stability. The proposed method is verified through various scenario in modified WSCC 9-bus and New England 39-bus systems. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm effectively mitigates power oscillations in the WT output, subsequently reducing power oscillations in the SG.</description></item><item><title>Deterministic and Probabilistic Forecasting of Wind Power Generation and Ramp Rate With Expectation-Implemented Deep Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11068153</link><description>Accurate day-ahead forecasting of wind power generation, both deterministically and probabilistically, is crucial for reliable and efficient power system operations, and its significance will increase in renewable energy-dominant power systems. Furthermore, inherent variability of wind farms necessitates day-ahead ramp rate forecasting to ensure stable energy balancing. To address these needs, we propose an hourly day-ahead forecasting framework that concurrently predicts the wind power generation and ramp rate. This framework leverages expectation-implemented deep learning models trained by the custom loss functions tailored to the different signal attributes and our distinct expectations. Additional strategies, such as feature generation and a feedforward error learning model, are implemented to enhance forecasting performance while maintaining a balance between tasks. Finally, our framework integrates heterogeneous generation and ramp rate forecasting results, incorporating probabilistic ramp rate forecasting derived from the synthesized output. We validate our approach using real wind power data and assess the impact of each proposed method individually. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly contribute to identifying the intrinsic volatility of wind power, thereby fully exploiting its potential benefits.</description></item><item><title>Optimal BESS Management for Peak Load Shaving and Battery Health Under Prediction Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11071638</link><description>In modern power grids, integrating renewable energy sources (RESs), deploying battery energy storage systems (BESSs) is increasingly vital for mitigating power fluctuations. However, optimizing BESS operation remains challenging amidst uncertainties in both RES and load forecasting. This paper proposes a novel stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) framework for BESS operation, focusing on peak load shaving and battery health while addressing prediction uncertainties. The proposed framework employs a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for forecasting and integrates a constraint-tightening technique into a stochastic optimization (SO) problem with a receding horizon. Based on the load profile of a company in Germany, the proposed framework achieves an additional reduction of 99 kW (5.8%) in peak grid take-out power compared with the traditional model predictive control (MPC) approach, demonstrating its advantage in addressing uncertainties.</description></item><item><title>PMU-Based Power Oscillation Damping Control for Renewable Energy System With Communication Disruption and Multi-Time Delays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11071336</link><description>This paper presents a novel model-free power oscillation damping strategy for renewable energy (RE) system considering communication disruption and multiple time delays in control loops. First, a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process-enabled online estimation method is developed for state-space modeling estimation only using measurement data. This estimation method is applicable to systems with different delays in each wide-area control loop. Subsequently, a novel wide-area power oscillation damper (POD) is designed for the renewable energy sources (RESs) and that is further reconstructed in a decomposition manner to achieve independently sub-control, which allows to retain better damping performance under communication disruption. After that, the POD parameter settings are carefully tuned, where the time delay and estimation error are considered, formulated as stability constraints using Razumikhin theorem, and solved via linear matrix inequality (LMI), yielding multi-dimensional robustness of the system, including operating conditions, time delay and communication disruption. Case studies in the improved 4-machine 2-area system and IEEE 39-bus system show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the state-space modeling of closed-loop system and effectively dampen power oscillations in time delay and communication disruption scenarios.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Method for Assessing Frequency Support Capability of Diverse Renewable Power Generation Units</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11061796</link><description>The proliferation of renewable power generation units (RGUs) deteriorates the physical inertia of the system, making the evaluation of unit-level frequency support capability (FSC) and system-level frequency stability increasingly important. However, the prior-art approaches lack a standardized framework for FSC assessment, and the non-disclosure of RGU information by manufacturers exacerbates this challenge. To address these issues, this paper proposes a unified transfer function structure (UTFS) model and its parameter solving method based on impedance measurement, enabling a unified assessment of both the unit-level FSC and system-level frequency stability. The unit-level UTFS can be obtained through frequency-domain approaches, e.g., xy-impedance measurements. Moreover, the system-level UTFS can be acquired through the simple aggregation of unit-level UTFS. Without detailed models or post-event data, the proposed framework uniformly represents the FSC of various RGUs through three key indicators: effective inertia, damping, and primary frequency regulation (PFR). Furthermore, the proposed method analytically derives system frequency indicators: frequency nadir, rate of change of frequency (RoCoF), and steady-state frequency deviation. Numerical simulations and analysis of the operational data of a provincial power grid are provided to validate the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Timescale Operational Optimization for Mobile Charging Solutions Considering Voltage Regulation Support for ADN: A Two-Stage Coordination Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051060</link><description>To alleviate the pressure of traditional fixed charging methods, mobile charging solutions have emerged in recent years. This article presents a two-stage coordination approach for mobile charging robots (MCRs) and active distribution networks (ADN). In the first stage, we maximize the total revenue for the MCRs from providing charging services for electric vehicles (EVs) and interacting with the ADN within a frame-based time scale, where the duration of each frame is determined by the charging decisions of MCRs. Furthermore, we consider the long-term objectives of meeting the battery energy deficit constraint for each MCR, thereby improving their battery life. Lyapunov optimization is utilized to transform frame-based scheduling into an optimization problem within a specified time slot, simplifying the process of solving the optimization problem. To avoid affecting charging efficiency when MCRs interact with the power grid, we use the reactive power of free MCRs to provide voltage regulation support for the ADN, improving power quality and minimizing total network loss simultaneously. Decoupling active and reactive power in two stages ensures both the profitability of the MCRs cluster and the voltage security of the ADN, resulting in a win-win situation. The simulation results, based on the 18-bus and 51-bus distribution networks, confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Assessing Grid Penalized Reinforcement Learning for Renewable Energy Management of Power-to-X Integrated With Intermediate Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051013</link><description>This research explores the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based planning strategies of power-to-X (PtX) systems under uncertainties of renewable and price through a detailed case study and comparative analysis of system planning. A DRL-based hourly planning model is proposed to minimize operational costs for a PtX system, incorporating a hybrid energy storage system. The model employs a grid-penalized reward function to manage grid power usage while accounting for temporal uncertainties in renewable and grid prices. To analyze the DRL model&#8217;s planning strategies, it is compared to a general rule-based model across varying spatial and temporal uncertainties using real-world data from national (France) areas. The results show that the DRL-based planning approach consistently outperforms the rule-based model, achieving 1,360.12% higher monthly profits in the national area, though with a relatively lower renewable energy penetration (REP). However, sensitivity analysis reveals that increasing the grid penalty level effectively reduces the gap in REP while sustaining higher profitability. This comparative analysis is the first to quantitatively reveal the planning strategies of a DRL-based PtX system, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing grid power overuse while maintaining higher profitability in system planning.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Proximal Policy Optimization With Embedded Dual Rules for Power Systems Considering Wind and Photovoltaic Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11059762</link><description>Most renewable energy power systems are created to provide more resilient, reliable, economical, sustainable and secure power support services for loads. However, owing to the inherent forecasting errors of wind and photovoltaic (PV) power, existing optimal dispatch decisions based on forecasting errors have biases. To address this issue, this paper proposes the distributed proximal policy optimization (DPPO) model with embedded dual rules for optimal power dispatch that considers wind and PV power forecasting error correction. The proposed model embeds forecasting and error correction information into the DPPO state space. Moreover, considering the physical characteristics and operational security constraints of the power grid, power balance and flow constraints are embedded in the DPPO network in a regular form. Finally, by integrating the established rules, wind and PV forecasting, and error correction information, the proposed model achieves optimal dispatch decisions through the calculation of state and execution of prescribed actions. The proposed method is applied and tested on a modified IEEE-30 bus system using actual data from a provincial power grid. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses optimal dispatch decisions caused by wind and PV forecasting errors. Compared with three other advanced methods, the proposed approach has significant advantages in promoting wind power accommodation, reducing operating costs, and enhancing the adaptability of optimal dispatch to uncertainty.</description></item><item><title>An End-to-End Ensemble Learning Approach for Enhancing Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048619</link><description>Accurate wind power forecasts are crucial for grid stability, thereby ensuring a reliable and efficient power supply. To characterize the complicated fluctuation of wind power, numerous ensemble models with multiple base forecasters have been developed. However, most existing ensemble forecasting models contain several modeling stages, which increases the risk of error accumulation and inefficiency in model training. Moreover, the limited number of base forecasters results in forecasts with reduced diversity, thereby diminishing the performance of ensemble models. To address these challenges, MG-DS, a simple but efficient end-to-end ensemble learning model based on the Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory, is proposed to unify base model learning and ensemble learning into a single process. It comprises an all-MLP-based nonlinear feature extraction module, a GRU and cross attention-based base forecast generation module, and a DS-based self-ensemble forecasting module with a DS-based magnifying glass to enhance the diversity of base forecasts. Further, a DS-based self-ensemble (DSSE) plugin is proposed to integrate the trained RNN-type and non-RNN-type base forecasters. Experiments on five wind power datasets show that MG-DS outperforms popular wind power forecasting models and ensemble techniques, and the effectiveness of the DSSE plugin is also validated in enhancing the performance of ensemble wind power forecasting.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Distributed Incentive Mechanism for Integrated Electricity and Heat Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045415</link><description>Coordination between electric power systems (EPS) and district heating systems (DHS) integrates more renewable energy and improves economic benefits. However, the dispatch of integrated electricity and heat systems (IEHS) raises privacy and incentive concerns. To address these issues, we propose a fully distributed incentive mechanism for IEHS. Specifically, the combined heat and power dispatch (CHPD) model is transformed into a monotone variational inequality (MVI) and solved by a fully distributed predictor-corrector algorithm (FDPCA). With FDPCA, the EPS and DHS operators can dispatch independently. Additionally, we use a novel two-stage benefit allocation approach based on Nash bargaining to distribute profits while simplifying computational complexity. Case studies demonstrate that the fully distributed incentive mechanism effectively protects privacy, enhances efficiency, and promotes cooperation.</description></item><item><title>Adaptable Parameters Estimation for Microgrid Distributed Energy Resources Using Modified Physics-Informed Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045087</link><description>Parameters estimation in microgrids remains challenging due to ambiguous system dynamics brought by distributed energy resources (DERs) and scarcity of data. This study presents a modified physics-informed neural network (PINN) paradigmdesigned for parameters estimation under such constraints. This paper introduces two main innovations: First, by combining small-signal analysis with the PINN framework for ordinary differential equations, we introduce an adaptable parameter estimation paradigm applicable to different types of DERs in microgrid. Second, we introduce a modified data transformation that reduces training time by up to 82.87% compared to traditional PINN approaches at best. To validate our approach, we conducted simulation on two typical system setups based on open-source real-world microgrid using real-time digital simulation to generate data. We evaluate the proposed method by using an error margin below 5% as a key metric to confirm its robustness and accuracy for different types of DERs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method across varying ordinary differential equations to diverse mathematical models. Additionally, suboptimal and failed cases are analyzed and discussed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the method&#8217;s limitations.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Fractional Programming-Based Planning Model for 100% Renewable Poly-Generation of Electricity and Methanol</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045219</link><description>Engaging in long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with renewable energy producers (REPs) is a promising strategy for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors, such as internet data centers. However, due to the inherent volatility and intermittency of renewable energy sources (RES), REPs typically require substantial over-installation of capacity to meet fixed PPA delivery commitments, resulting in significant energy curtailment and increased supply costs. Power-to-methanol (P2M) offers a viable pathway for large-scale integration of RES by providing flexible chemical storage and demand. This study proposes a unified planning framework for the 100% renewable poly-generation of electricity and methanol, considering both flexible and inflexible loads. The objective is to maximize the internal rate of return (IRR), a key metric for investment decision-making. To this end, a mixed-integer linear fractional programming (MILFP) model is developed and solved in a computationally tractable manner. The model is validated using real-world data. Results show that the proposed approach significantly improves IRR, reduces RES curtailment, and lowers the levelized costs of both electricity and methanol. Furthermore, the model effectively coordinates electricity delivery under PPA constraints with methanol synthesis, offering an economically robust solution for renewable energy utilization and sector coupling.</description></item><item><title>Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning Method for Volt/Var Control in Active Distribution Network With Safe Operation Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045109</link><description>In recent years, distributed energy resources (DERs) in power systems have been increasingly integrated into the distribution network. DERs will improve the flexibility and economy of active distribution networks (ADNs) while introducing increased complexity and challenges in maintaining stable and efficient system operations. The traditional voltage regulation methods struggle to cope with these complexities, highlighting the need for more advanced and adaptive control strategies for fast-response PVs and battery energy storage systems (BESS). This paper proposes a novel Human-in-the-loop deep reinforcement learning (HITL-DRL) framework for Volt/Var control in ADNs, addressing the limitations of the existing approaches by integrating human experience and knowledge into the learning process. Additionally, a Security-Clipped Proximal Policy Optimization (SC-PPO) algorithm is introduced to ensure safe operation during reinforcement learning. The paper explores three human-intervention strategies: human demonstration, human feedback, and setting adversary, which enhance the learning process by leveraging expert knowledge and experience. The proposed HITL-DRL framework demonstrates improved convergence speed, robustness, reduced exploration risk, and increased interpretability and trust, paving the way for more effective voltage regulation in complex power systems. The proposed HITL-DRL method is verified in the IEEE 33-bus system, demonstrating superior performance over standard DRL algorithms in terms of training speed and robustness, achieving the highest average reward and the second-fastest computational time. Compared to traditional PPO, our method significantly excels in managing unforeseen contingencies, resulting in a lower voltage violation rate of 73.4%. Compared with the model-based method, the strategy of HITL-DRL is very close to that of optimization results in terms of energy loss and voltage violation rates. However, HITL-DRL shows advantages in decision-making time, responding within 1 millisecond, which is capable of rapidly adapting to time-vary changes in ADNs.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Flexibility Aggregation of Heterogeneous Demand-Side Energy Storages for Secondary Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11044873</link><description>Demand-side energy storages (DESs), such as household batteries and electric vehicles (EVs), have shown great potential in providing fast frequency regulation services. This paper proposes a three-layer hierarchical flexibility aggregation framework to fully evaluate and reliably realize the aggregate flexibility of heterogeneous DESs for secondary frequency regulation (SFR). At the device layer, the regulation capacity of an individual DES is modeled as a two-dimensional feasible region, with the real-time state-of-charge (SoC) constraint and the statistical features of regulation signals well considered. On this basis, heterogeneous DESs are divided into several clusters according to the geometry of their feasible region. At the cluster layer, regulation capacity, dynamic response model as well as regulation costs are efficiently aggregated within each DES cluster by prototype-based maximum inner approximation (MIA). At the aggregator layer, an analytical expression of the multi-cluster coordinated SFR flexibility can be formulated by convex optimizations at each feasible operating point, which provides a comprehensive model for DES aggregators to economically participate in SFR. Comparative simulations validate that the proposed method can accurately capture the aggregate SFR flexibility of heterogeneous DESs with lower flexibility loss and affordable computational burden, while the disaggregation feasibility of aggregate flexibility is further demonstrated using real-world regulation signals.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Autonomous Control for Global Economic Operation of AC/DC Microgrid Clusters Interconnected by Flexible DC Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045308</link><description>This paper presents a distributed autonomous control strategy for AC/DC microgrid clusters interconnected by the flexible DC distribution network to simultaneously achieve the global economic operation and frequency/voltage control of the system while complying with the power limits of DGs and interlinking converters.

Mobile wind turbines (MWTs) are uniquely positioned to navigate transportation systems, being towed by trucks, and supply energy to power distribution systems (PDSs). This flexibility enables MWTs to serve as emergency power sources, thereby contributing to enhancing the system resilience by facilitating service restoration following extreme events. This paper presents a novel framework based on Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) to dispatch MWTs for service restoration. Deep Q-learning (DQL) and Double Deep Q-learning (DDQL) approaches are implemented within the agent for training and comparison purposes. Additionally, an action limitation is incorporated into the proposed framework in order to mitigate the influence of wind power fluctuations. Case studies conducted on an integrated power-transport system, comprising a Sioux Falls transportation system and four IEEE 33-bus test systems, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed restoration scheduling policy in enhancing PDSs&#8217; resilience against disasters.</description></item><item><title>Robust Unit Commitment With Multi-State Uncertainty: A Novel Formulation and Scalable Solution Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045107</link><description>To mitigate the conservatism of scheduling schemes derived from the two-stage robust unit commitment model (TS-RUCM), this paper proposes a novel multi-state uncertainty set (MSUS) considering the uncertain wind power output (WPO). The MSUS formulates WPO uncertainties with higher resolution by introducing multiple discrete state values within the uncertain interval. Additionally, the MSUS limits extreme fluctuations of WPO uncertainties among state values through transition indicators embedded in multiple transition constraints. The state values and transition indicators are calculated using the conditional quantile regression technique and Markov chain analysis. This systematic and scientific approach allows the MSUS to effectively exclude low-probability WPO scenarios, thereby significantly mitigating the conservatism of the scheduling schemes. Moreover, to accelerate the computation of the TS-RUCM based on the MSUS, this paper proposes an improved inexact column and constraint generation (II-C&amp;amp;CG) method. The II-C&amp;amp;CG method employs an adaptive tolerance strategy and refined backtracking to solve master and subproblems inexactly while ensuring finite convergence, significantly reducing computational time. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of both the MSUS and the II-C&amp;amp;CG method.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Artificial Intelligence and Physics-Based Modeling for Long-Term Cascaded Hydropower Scheduling Under Extreme Heat Events</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11059276</link><description>The operation of hydropower plants are significantly challenged by extreme heatwave events. This paper integrates artificial intelligence and a physics-based model to introduce an efficient long-term scheduling framework aimed at maximizing hydropower generation during extreme heat events. The water values derived from the proposed long-term scheduling model can be used in developing effective strategies for short-term hydropower scheduling. A physics-based evaporation model (PEM), which captures key land-atmosphere interactions, is developed to account for significant variations in reservoir evaporation rates during extreme heat events. A multivariate long short-term memory (M-LSTM) forecasting model is also utilized to predict the key input parameters required for both the PEM and the long-term scheduling problem. A regression-based machine learning algorithm is also utilized to estimate the hydropower production function, which enables linear integration of the nonlinear and nonconvex behavior of hydropower plant in the mixed-integer linear formulation of the scheduling problem. The proposed model is applied to a case study of eleven cascaded hydropower units located on the Columbia river.

To reduce energy costs and carbon emissions, aggregating 5G BSs (Macro BS and Micro BS), and distributed renewable energy into virtual power plants (VPPs) to participate in market transactions has become a trend. However, the operation of VPPs faces challenges: the uncertainty of renewable energy output and the unclear regulation mechanism of BSs. Consequently, this paper focuses on developing an optimal scheduling strategy for VPPs, considering the schedulability of BSs and the uncertainty of internal renewable energy. Firstly, the flexibility of BSs with 4G and 5G modules is investigated, particularly in terms of transceivers and backup energy storage. The communication rates of BSs are modeled to evaluate the impact of active transceiver numbers on user experience. A dynamic time-domain model of backup energy storage capacity considering communication load is proposed. The impact of user mobility and overlapping coverage areas of BSs on communication rates is considered to be more in line with real-world scenarios. Subsequently, an optimization model is developed for VPPs to maximize the profit of engaging BSs in the day-ahead market transaction, considering diverse communication rate requirements. The optimization model determines the schedule of transceivers, backup energy storage, and other resources. Then, to control the operational risks associated with the uncertainty of internal distributed renewable energy outputs, the chance constraint is introduced. Furthermore, the Taylor expansion-based algorithm is applied to coordinately solve the VPP dispatching problem. Numerical simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models, which achieve a 5.4% increase in the proportion of internal renewable energy consumption and a 18.72% increase in economic benefits.</description></item><item><title>Synthetic Inertia Control for a Wind Turbine Generator Based on Event Size and Rotor Speed</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045832</link><description>To enhance the frequency nadir without causing the excessive deceleration of the rotor speed (${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$), synthetic inertia control (SIC) schemes of a wind turbine generator (WTG) need to provide incremental power in response to event magnitude and ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$. Conventional stepwise SIC approaches face limitations during large events due to the increase of predefined incremental power, which does not match the actual event size. This paper presents an SIC strategy for WTGs that adjusts incremental power in relation to event size and ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$. During the frequency-support phase, the incremental power is modulated based on the frequency deviation, along with a control gain proportional to ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$, rather than the rate of change of frequency. While this approach accounts for the power imbalance, it remains vulnerable to noise and delays in practical applications. After the frequency-support phase, the proposed method decreases the active power reference in accordance with ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$, ensuring it stabilizes within a secure operating range. Following stabilization, the WTG transitions smoothly back to maximum power point tracking operation. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach significantly enhances the frequency nadir during large events, even under low wind conditions, while avoiding excessive deceleration of the rotor speed.</description></item><item><title>Prototype Federated Reinforcement Learning for Voltage Regulation in Distribution Systems With Physics-Aware Spatial-Temporal Graph Perception</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045127</link><description>Online voltage regulation in active distribution systems faces challenges stemming from privacy protection concerns and uncertainties introduced by renewable energy sources. To address these issues, a novel spatial-temporal transformer-based prototype federated reinforcement learning (STT-PFRL) model is proposed to mitigate voltage deviations while ensuring data privacy. Specifically, STT-PFRL operating within a decentralized framework trains the model by transmitting local prototype information between a central data server and local agents, avoiding raw data privacy leakage. Besides, a novel physics-aware spatial-temporal transformer network is proposed to improve the voltage regulation policy learning stability against uncertainties by embedding the spatial-temporal graphical physics information into the data aggregation process. Furthermore, the prototype learning-based federated soft actor-critic (ProtoFedSAC) algorithm incorporates a prototype layer to utilize diverse feature representations, thereby enhancing the model&#8217;s ability to handle heterogeneity in environmental data. Simulation results on 33- and 118-node distribution systems demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of STT-PFRL in voltage regulation.</description></item><item><title>County-Level Distributed PV Day-Ahead Power Prediction Based on Grey Correlation Analysis and Transformer-GCAN Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11061797</link><description>The distributed photovoltaic (PV) power stations within the entire county exist spatiotemporal correlation. Merely considering temporal correlation makes it challenging to meet the day-ahead scheduling demands. This paper proposes a distributed PV county-level day-ahead power prediction method based on grey relational analysis and the Transformer-Graph Convolutional Attention Network (Transformer-GCAN) model. Firstly, the grey relational degree is used to measure the relevance between each distributed PV stations, and the connection relationship of the station graph is determined based on the analysis results. Secondly, the Transformer network is utilized to extract the temporal features of each PV sequence in the graph. Based on the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model, a Graph Attention Mechanism (GAT) is introduced to dynamically extract spatial features between each photovoltaic station in the graph. Finally, the integration of spatiotemporal features is achieved through a fully connected neural network, enabling day-ahead power prediction at the county level. Case analysis results demonstrate that compared with the Transformer-GCN model, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the power prediction model proposed in this paper is reduced by 11.90%, 15.72% and 19.61% respectively in sunny days, cloudy days and rainy days.</description></item><item><title>Power Capacity Allocation Among Multiple Renewable Power Plants: A Perspective From System Strength</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11122291</link><description>Large-scale renewable energy projects consisting of renewable power plants (RPPs) managed by different stakeholders may suffer weak system strength. Consequently, only a limited amount of renewable power capacity can be delivered, or the insufficient system strength could incur stability issues. The allocation of system strength constrained power capacity among different RPPs deserves investigation, which is critical to their respective benefits. To this end, the system strength demand of each RPP is quantified based on its allowable power capacity. A power capacity allocation approach is proposed, ensuring that the RPPs efficiently and fairly utilize system strength. Case studies show that RPPs with longer electrical distances deliver less renewable capacity due to their greater impact on system strength.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Event-Triggered Sliding Mode Control for Reactive and Unbalanced Power Sharing in Islanded AC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11230861</link><description>To address the reactive and unbalanced power sharing in islanded AC microgrids with communication constraints and disturbances, novel distributed secondary control methods are proposed by combining event-triggered schemes and sliding mode control, which can save communication resources and cope with external bounded disturbances, respectively. In specific, the sliding mode control with fast reaching law is firstly designed here such that the sliding surface is reached within a finite time. Moreover, an event-triggered scheme with a dynamically regulated threshold depending on sliding mode is designed in the distributed secondary control to reduce communication burden without Zeno behavior. The integration of sliding mode control and event-triggered scheme induces the difficulty in the stability analysis of the proposed control methods, which is handled by selecting applicable Lyapunov function. Finally, simulation results are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the design methods.</description></item><item><title>A Graph-Theoretic Approach for Ensuring Stability in DC Microgrid Networks During Mode Switching</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11240236</link><description>This paper proposes a graph-theoretic approach to ensure stability in networked DC microgrids (DCMGs) during mode switching. This method addresses voltage instability that occurs during mode switching from one mode to another scheduled by the upper-level energy management of the microgrid network. First, a switched system model is established for networked DCMGs with multiple operational modes, from which the switching stability criterion and the voltage fluctuation index are derived through a family of Lyapunov functions. Then, a directed graph is constructed to facilitate the search and planning of stable mode switching paths, where the vertices represent the modes, the edges are governed by switching stability criteria, and the edge weights correspond to voltage fluctuation indices. The graph model converts the mode-switching stability problem into a reachability path planning problem in graph theory, bridging the current mode to the target mode determined by the upper-level energy management. To identify the optimal mode-switching path, a depth-first search algorithm is employed, which provides a stable path with the minimal voltage fluctuation. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated through simulation in MATLAB/Simulink and Modeling Tech StarSim platform.</description></item><item><title>Edge Computing-Based Cyber-Physical Interdependent Power Restoration of Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11230619</link><description>The digitalization of distribution networks intensifies the coupling between cyber and physical networks. Edge computing devices offer significant flexibility for organizing distributed energy resources and enabling multi-area coordinated control, demonstrating considerable potential to enhance the power restoration capability of active distribution networks.

This makes the coordinated multi-period joint active and reactive power dispatch (C-MP-ARPD) problem a bilevel mixed-integer nonlinear programming (bilevel-MINLP) one. Nevertheless, research on the bilevel coordinated optimization problems with binary variables at each level is extremely limited. To fill this research gap, this work proposes a spherical manifold-based optimization method for the C-MP-ARPD problem. Specifically, the  $l_{2}$ -box method is employed to transform the bilevel-MINLP problem into a bilevel Riemannian nonlinear programming problem within the continuous domain. Then, a manifold-based model decomposition strategy is proposed, obtaining relaxed subproblems, box-subproblems and sphere-subproblems of both ADN and MGs, which can be efficiently coordinated by the enhanced manifold-based ADMM algorithm. Besides, a Riemannian trust-region method is employed to solve sphere-subproblems efficiently. Moreover, the bilevel relaxed subproblem of ADN and MGs is further equivalently decomposed into several small-scale subproblems by exploiting the spatio-temporal structure. Correspondingly, a hierarchical spatio-temporal decomposition method is developed to efficiently coordinate those obtained subproblems in a fully distributed and parallel manner. Finally, by integrating the aforementioned methods, a spherical manifold-based optimization approach is proposed for solving the C-MP-ARPD problem. The accuracy, computational efficiency, and convergence performance of the proposed method are verified through comparison with the commercial MIP solver Gurobi, as well as other representative distributed methods.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Parameters of the LinDistFlow Power Flow Approximation for Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11230858</link><description>The DistFlow model accurately represents power flows in distribution systems, but the model&#8217;s nonlinearities result in computational challenges for many applications. Accordingly, a linear approximation known as LinDistFlow (and its three-phase extension LinDist3Flow) is commonly employed. This paper introduces a parameter optimization algorithm for enhancing the accuracy of this approximation for both balanced single-phase equivalent and unbalanced three-phase distribution network models, with the goal of aligning the outputs more closely with those from the nonlinear DistFlow model. Using sensitivity information, our algorithm optimizes the LinDistFlow approximation&#8217;s coefficient and bias parameters to minimize discrepancies in predictions of voltage magnitudes relative to the nonlinear DistFlow model. The parameter optimization algorithm employs the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) method to fine-tune coefficients and bias parameters during an offline training phase to improve the LinDistFlow approximation&#8217;s accuracy. Numerical results underscore the algorithm&#8217;s efficacy, showcasing accuracy improvements in  $L_{1}$ -norm and  $L_{\infty }$ -norm losses of up to 92% and 88%, respectively, relative to the traditional LinDistFlow model. We also assess how the optimized parameters perform under changes in the network topology and demonstrate the optimized LinDistFlow approximation&#8217;s efficacy in a hosting capacity optimization problem.</description></item><item><title>Secondary Frequency Control Through Serverless Cloud Computing for Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11231387</link><description>With the growing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs), many regulating entities, such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in the USA, have initiated a notice of inquiry for the utilization of cloud services for power system operation, including ancillary grid services from DERs. Motivated by these initiatives, this paper develops a serverless cloud computing architecture for real-time secondary frequency control in active distribution networks (ADNs). A secondary frequency control architecture is developed along with an optimization-based controller for optimally dispatching the regulating units in response to automatic generation control (AGC) signals. The developed optimization is fully integrated with the proposed serverless cloud computing architecture, utilizing several Amazon Web Services (AWS) such as Lambda, IoT Core, and S3. The AWS cloud architecture communicates with a real-time digital simulator, which mimics an ADN, utilizing IoT devices like Raspberry Pi and several utility standard communication protocols such as MQTT and TCP/IP. To demonstrate the dispatch of regulating units using the proposed serverless cloud computing architecture&#8212;and to validate the performance of the developed optimization-based controller&#8212;a real-time model of an actual feeder from NV Energy (the largest utility in Nevada) is utilized. Furthermore, a grid response time analysis is conducted to enable proper sequencing of frequency regulation commands by predicting the actual response time of the grid. The results of accurately dispatching the regulating units in response to AGC signals validate the accuracy of the optimization, demonstrate the successful implementation of the proposed serverless cloud-based AGC, and set the stage for practically implementing the proposed solutions.</description></item><item><title>Research on Protection Method for DC Distribution Networks Based on Fault Current Energy Peak-to-Average Ratio</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11250597</link><description>Existing protection methods for DC distribution networks suffer from limitations such as low transition resistance tolerance, noise susceptibility, and inadequate speed. To overcome these challenges, this paper first establishes a bipolar short-circuit fault model that considers multi-converter interactions. Based on this model, we reveal the intrinsic relationship between fault current energy distribution and fault conditions, and propose a novel protection criterion utilizing the Energy Peak-to-Average Ratio (EPAR) of the fault current. By converting the time-domain waveform characteristics of the fault current into energy distribution features, the method effectively characterizes the influence of transition resistance on fault characteristics, enabling rapid and reliable identification of high-impedance bipolar short-circuit faults. An adaptive collaborative protection method leveraging the complementary characteristics of EPAR and current variation is developed. By constructing a dual-criterion coordination mechanism integrating current variation and EPAR, this method enables dynamic setting and complementary identification, ensuring full-line rapid protection for internal bipolar faults. Furthermore, the impact of setting value selection on protection reliability and sensitivity was quantitatively analyzed, constraints in the protection setting process were elucidated, and a theoretical basis for applying the proposed method to DC distribution networks with different structures was provided. A 10 kV multi-terminal flexible DC distribution network model incorporating diverse converters is built in PSCAD/EMTDC to validate the proposed method under various fault conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the method accurately discriminates faults within 1.5 ms after occurrence, achieves transition resistance tolerance up to  $100~\Omega $ , and exhibits strong noise immunity.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Load Restoration of Coupled Power-Transportation Systems Considering Healthcare System Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224497</link><description>The interdependence of power and transportation systems tightens over time, which brings significant chances and challenges to the coordinated restoration of coupled power-transportation systems under extreme weather events.

This paper proposes an innovative framework to dispatch restoration resources to quickly recover the operation of power-transportation systems, while considering patient delivery and treatment for healthcare system operation. A multi-time-section approach is proposed to enable real-time decision-making under dynamic power and transportation network conditions. Additionally, a moment-independent global sensitivity analysis method using a machine learning-based surrogate model is developed to identify the critical uncertain factors that most significantly impact the restoration of coupled power-transportation systems, considering healthcare system operation. This enables the emergency command center to make informed preventive and restoration strategies.

Most of the existing studies on carbon pricing overlook the impact of energy consumption behavior of consumers and fail to leverage the potential of demand-sides to achieve greater carbon emission reductions. This paper proposes a low-carbon demand response (LCDR) framework for decarbonization of power-hydrogen integrated energy systems (PH-IESs) and an equitable allocation of carbon responsibility to various types of consumers. A consumer-based carbon pricing strategy with improved marginal carbon intensity is first developed to quantify the impact of the amount and behavior of energy consumption on carbon responsibility and costs. Then, a consumer-based LCDR model is proposed for demand-side energy aggregators (DSEAs) who adjust flexible loads to reduce operation costs and carbon emissions based on the determined carbon price. Finally, a low-carbon operation model is formulated to schedule the PH-IESs considering the responses of DSEAs. To capture renewable uncertainties and reduce decision conservatism, distributionally robust joint chance constraints are established capitalizing on heterogeneous information (i.e., moment, unimodality, and mode skewness). Case studies verify the effectiveness of the proposed LCDR framework.</description></item><item><title>Emission and Economy Balanced Dispatching of Integrated Power and Hydrogen Systems via a Tri-Level Robust Optimizer Incorporating Multi-Time Resolution and Carbon Tax</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11232499</link><description>The escalating demand for hydrogen forces hydrogen generation station (HGS) to seek a stable power supply, that is inherently contradicts the intermittency of distributed renewable energy (DRE). Whilst the affordable active distribution network (ADN) electricity mostly sourced from fossil fuels goes against decarbonization vision. To balance economy and emission, an efficient integrated power and hydrogen system (IPHS), featuring a full-cycle carbon tax and hybrid energy storage, is proposed. Particularly, the full-cycle carbon tax fosters optimized utilization of clean energies and development of high-efficiency solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). The ADN involves li-ion batteries to derisk DRE curtailment. Whilst a two-layer optimizer is proposed to lower emission of the HGS, where the inner layer leverages a vehicle routing problem (VRP) to decarbonize hydrogen selling, and the outer layer serves to improve efficiency of hydrogen production and conversion. On privacy barrier, the ADN and HGS are unified by alternated directed multiplier method (ADMM), yielding a tri-level robust model. Given the integer-rich NP-hard nature of this model, due to 5-minute battery scheduling and inner VRP, a multi-time resolution solver is tailored. It segregates IPHS operations into a 1-hour ADN-HGS interaction stage following HGS&#8217;s slow responses, and an enhanced fast 5-minute battery schedule phase to compensate DRE stochasticity. Numerical studies indicate that, the proposed model reduces carbon emissions by at least 20.5% and operating costs by 7.6% across various seasonal scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Control of a Boiling Water Small Modular Reactor Cogeneration System for District Heating Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11245633</link><description>This paper proposes a novel approach for modeling and controlling a Small Modular Reactor (SMR) cogeneration power plant for District Heating Network (DHN) applications, aimed at decarbonizing energy systems and enhancing power grid flexibility. Existing studies do not adequately address key aspects of the dynamic modeling and control of SMR-based DHN cogeneration plants, including insufficient representation of piping heat losses, thermal delays, fluctuations in DHN thermal demand, and the lack of multi-timescale dynamic analyses. Thus, this work proposes dynamic models and control strategies for SMR-based DHN cogeneration systems, incorporating detailed thermoelectric modeling that addresses the current modeling shortcomings to allow for the assessment of system stability over both short- and long-term horizons to properly evaluate transient and steady-state performance. Furthermore, the paper assesses the SMR-based DHN cogeneration system by examining its dynamic interactions with the Electric Power Network (EPN) and DHN under realistic scenarios to support industry-driven control design and operational decisions. In this context, the proposed model and controls are validated using the boiling water reactor BWRX-300 being integrated into the power grid of Ontario, Canada, considering a potential DHN deployment in the Darlington region. The results highlight the strong potential of SMRs for cogeneration, demonstrating their operational flexibility in a practical application and illustrating a significant reduction in energy consumption compared to heating systems based on solely Heat Pumps (HPs), considering that existing government policies in Ontario, like in other jurisdictions, are incentivizing the replacement of fossil fuel-based space heating systems with HPs.</description></item><item><title>Carbon-Centric Hybrid-Game Robust Planning of Multiple Integrated Energy Systems Considering Higher-Order Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11263952</link><description>With the growing focus on carbon neutrality, integrated energy systems (IESs) have become vital for low-carbon transitions. However, conventional multi-IES planning remains energy-centric, overlooking inter- and intra-system interactions of carbon trading and carbon-based pricing. Therefore, this paper proposes a carbon-centric hybrid-game robust planning model for multi-IESs under higher-order uncertainties (HOUs). The proposed model integrates an inter-IES Nash bargaining game to enhance system-wide coordination with dynamic carbon trading, and an intra-IES Stackelberg game to improve supplier-user interaction via carbon-based energy pricing. A novel low-carbon flexible retrofitted CHP structure, alongside its extended carbon emission flow (ECEF) model, is developed to provide physical support for dynamic carbon attribution. Additionally, to address HOUs in renewable outputs, a confidence band-based ambiguity set is constructed, considering both parameter and distributional variations for system robust planning. A decomposition algorithm combining adaptive ADMM and parallel C&amp;amp;CG is implemented to ensure computational tractability. Finally, case studies on a real-world system in Southern China validate the effectiveness of the proposed model in improving emission reduction, operational flexibility, and planning robustness.</description></item><item><title>Constrained Semi-MDP Formulation and Perception-Enhanced Safe Policy Learning for Efficient Dynamic Task Scheduling of Data Centers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11236459</link><description>With the exponential growth of global data generation and the energy consumption of data centers (DCs), efficient dynamic task scheduling has become critical to optimize energy costs while ensuring the quality of the service. Model predictive control (MPC) method is burdened with significant computational complexity and exhibits limited uncertainty adaptability, heuristic methods overlook the energy cost optimization objective and may lead to sub-optimal schedules, while conventional reinforcement learning (RL) methods based on Markov decision processes (MDPs) face significant dimensionality challenge in discrete action spaces and struggle to satisfy the temporal-coupling task deadline constraints. This paper proposes a Constrained Semi-MDP (CSMDP) formulation for dynamic task scheduling considering heterogeneous tasks and servers. It introduces temporally-extended sub-actions executable across multiple sub-processes, omitting exhaustive search for appropriate task-server pair combinations. A dual-agent architecture involving a task selection agent and a server assignment agent are designed to work collaboratively to optimize energy costs while satisfying task deadlines and resource constraints. A safe RL method is proposed that employs a constraint-value network and a shielding mechanism for task selection and server assignment agents to enforce resource capacity and time-coupling deadline constraints, while jointly optimizing the latter with an action-value network to improve energy cost efficiency. Case studies based on Alibaba real production dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of scheduling policy optimality and safety, uncertainty generalization and computational efficiency, against state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>Electricity-Carbon Collaborative Optimization of Electrolytic Aluminum Load Considering Green Certificate-Carbon Trading and Demand Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11249460</link><description>Due to its large capacity and rapid adjustment capability, the electrolytic aluminum load (EAL) possesses significant potential for flexibility and can participate in demand response (DR) to alleviate peak regulation pressures on the power system. Within the frameworks of carbon emissions trading (CET), green-certificate trading (GCT), and renewable portfolio standards (RPS), the electricity-carbon benefits of the EAL acting as a multi-market participant are tightly coupled. Therefore, it is imperative to develop an electricity&#8211;carbon collaborative optimization strategy for EALs participating in DR. First, based on the dynamic carbon emission characteristics of EAL, a GCT-CET coupling model is constructed, and the ladder CET cost structure is enhanced to better characterize carbon trading expenses. Then, the production regulation model, regulation benefit model, and DR model are formulated for the EAL. Finally, considering the uncertainty of on-site photovoltaic (PV) generation, a stochastic electricity-carbon optimization model is proposed, incorporating GCT, CET, and DR, with the objective of maximizing the comprehensive net benefits. A real-plant case study demonstrates that the proposed model increases the EAL&#8217;s comprehensive net benefit while substantially reducing average energy consumption and total CEs. Sensitivity analyses with respect to the compensation price coefficient, carbon-quota auction ratio, and carbon-quota reduction ratio further verify robustness. Overall, the results indicate that electricity-carbon co-optimization enables EAL participation in DR to deliver both economic and environmental benefits.</description></item><item><title>An Easy-to-Hard Curriculum Learning Framework for Fast Production Cost Minimization Simulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11245207</link><description>The production cost minimization (PCM) problem in power systems involves numerous binary variables, resulting in prolonged solving times and a trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency, affecting the economic viability of operations. Our previous research has explored algorithmic enhancements using machine learning techniques to achieve optimal solutions while reducing solving times. However, as power systems evolve, new PCM models incorporating diverse factors emerge, each presenting varying levels of solving difficulty. Traditional supervised learning, commonly used in algorithmic enhancements, assumes that all training data from PCM problems with varying solving difficulties are provided to training model simultaneously. This limits further improvements in solving efficiency. To address this issue, this paper introduces an easy-to-hard curriculum learning (CL)-based imitation learning (IL) framework that progressively guides IL from simple PCM problems to more complex problems. The one-pass rule is employed to expedite the training process during the transition to more difficult PCM problems. Additionally, a difficulty-oriented component network selection mechanism is introduced to choose appropriate weight parameters for solving PCM problems, thereby enhancing performance on target tasks. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework can accelerate the training process and shows good performance on target tasks.</description></item><item><title>A Robust Singular Perturbation Method for Decoupling of Power and Voltage Control of Grid-Forming Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11245583</link><description>Grid-forming converters (GFMCs), which provide superior grid formulation and supportive services, have been identified as the enabler of more-electronics power systems. Control of GFMCs mainly comprises outer-power and inner-voltage loops. Although existing literature assumes that the two loops can be independently analyzed and designed, we reveal that the converter may be unstable even with two individually stabilized control loops, thereby implying their strong coupling effect. To realize the decoupling design of power and voltage control loops, we propose a robust singular perturbation method, which comprises a marriage of robust control and singular perturbation theory. Specifically, we construct the converter model as an interconnection of slow and fast subsystems, and derive two quantitative criteria regarding system stability and performance, respectively. Through the proposed method, we successfully quantify the coupling effects between the two loops at each frequency point, enabling the identification of the maximum coupling and the critical coupling frequency. Accordingly, we provide insightful guidelines for simplified controller design. The correctness of the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed decoupling method are validated by simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Learning Active Constraints for Bilevel Optimization: Evaluating Classification Metrics on Real-World Distribution System Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11245557</link><description>Bilevel optimization provides a useful power system modeling framework, but it is computationally demanding due to its NP-hard nature and the need for frequent solutions under uncertainty. To mitigate this, machine learning can be used to predict active constraints, enabling the deduction of a reduced problem formulation. However, prediction errors are inevitable, and synthetic training data may not fully reflect real-world conditions. This paper presents a structured approach to managing uncertainty by classifying constraints into three sets &#8211; active, inactive, and unpredictable &#8211; where each constraint is modeled using a separate binary classifier. The method is applied to a real-world bilevel distribution system optimization problem: the upper level solves an AC Optimal Power Flow, while the lower level minimizes residential photovoltaic power curtailment. Training data are generated from daily exact bilevel solutions, incorporating variability in electricity prices, consumption, and photovoltaic power generation. Results show that the reduced formulation effectively solves the problem, up to 10 times faster with a marginal objective value deviation (&#8722;3% to + 4%).</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Virtual Impedance-Based Closed-Loop Voltage Control Strategy for Smart Transformer-Interfacing Distribution Grid With High PV Penetration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11251011</link><description>The substantial increase of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems in low-voltage distribution grids has resulted in an escalating problem of exceeding voltage upper limits due to reverse power flow. Numerous strategies have been suggested to address the issue of voltage violating the voltage upper limits. Nevertheless, the conventional approaches are essentially open-loop control methods and exhibit steady-state errors. In addition, unbalanced loads or single-phase PV can cause traditional methods to be ineffective. This article proposes an adaptive virtual impedance-based closed-loop voltage control strategy for smart transformer (ST)- interfacing distribution grid. Utilizing adaptive virtual impedance-based closed-loop control, ST can regulate the maximum bus voltage of the distribution grid at the voltage threshold without static error, hence enabling the control of other buses within the voltage threshold when reverse power flow occurs. Besides, as the proposed control strategy is implemented in the abc control coordinate system, it can still effectively regulate the maximum bus voltage at the voltage threshold in the presence of unbalanced loads or the sudden connection of single-phase PV systems. Furthermore, to ensure the stability of the system, impedance-based stability is analyzed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulation based upon real data of a radial distribution feeder and a simplified ST-interfacing distribution grid experiment.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Robust Chance-Constrained Optimization for Distribution Substation Restoration With Quickly Detachable Transformers and Mobile Emergency Storage Dispatch Under HEMP Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11270969</link><description>High Altitude Electromagnetic Pulse (HEMP) attacks can cause significant damage to substations in power distribution systems (DSs). In this paper, we propose a distributed robust model for the distribution substation restoration (DSR) with mobile emergency storage (MES) devices along with quickly detachable transformers (QDTs) to expedite DS load pickups under HEMP attacks. For substation restoration, we dissect the DSR problem into transportation and installation subproblems to replace faulty QDTs. Since DSR considers short-period transportation agents, a dynamic interval dispatching strategy in the continuous time domain is formulated for the coupled power-transportation system (PTS). Then, distributed robust chance-constraints are constructed under each dynamic dispatching time interval to address the travel time uncertainty during substation restoration. To support practical solutions, safe tractable approximation and binary extension methods are employed to transform the proposed PTS model into a mixed-integer second-order conic programming. Case studies on the modified IEEE 33-bus system and modified 141-bus system verify the effectiveness of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Leveraging DER Frequency Response for Enhanced Power System Resilience</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11275959</link><description>The growing presence of distributed energy resources (DERs) requires better orchestration between Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and Distribution System Operators (DSOs) for secure power system operation. While typically studied for reliability, the potential of TSO-DSO energy exchange to improve resilience during extreme events needs more research. Moreover, existing studies focus on leveraging DER flexibility to enhance distribution system resilience. This paper introduces a novel framework that evaluates the impact of DER flexibility on overall system resilience, considering the spatial progression of hazard events across both transmission and distribution networks. The framework encompasses spatiotemporal modeling of hazard scenarios and dynamic analyses to assess contributions of TSO-DSO energy exchange to resilience enhancement, using metrics such as frequency settling time and unserved load. Application of this framework to a 39-node system, representing both transmission and distribution (T&amp;amp;D) network, reveals that DER flexibility can significantly reduce frequency settling time &#8211; by up to 47% in high-inertia systems and over 65% in low-inertia systems &#8211; highlighting the impact of DERs on the rapid restoration of power balance and the prevention of widespread blackouts. Simultaneously, the unserved load is reduced by approximately 52.49% in high-inertia systems and 39.67% in low-inertia systems.</description></item><item><title>Spatial Flexibility Provision From Geographically Dispersed Data Centers Enabling Coordinated Operation of Multi-Local Flexibility Markets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11316215</link><description>In local flexibility markets (LFMs), distribution system operators (DSOs) can obtain flexibility from distributed energy resource aggregators (DERAs) to address operation problems of distribution systems (DSs). However, in a single LFM, the supply and demand of flexibility may not be balanced, leading DSOs to face significant economic challenges. In this paper, leveraging the geographically coupled flexibility (GCF) provided by geographically dispersed data centers (DCs), a coordinated operation framework for multi-LFMs is proposed. This framework enables wireless connections between multi- LFMs without geographical limitations, only requiring interactions between DSOs and their local DC. To clear the multi-LFMs, an optimization model is established with the objective of minimizing total operation costs of multi-LFMs. The optimization model is solved by ADMM to protect the data privacy. A settlement method for GCF is proposed to allocate the total cost fairly. Furthermore, the uncertain parameters are addressed using distributionally robust chance constraints based on Wasserstein metric. Three DCs, which are connected to three DSs adapted from IEEE 15-bus, 33-bus, and 69-bus DSs, respectively, are used in case studies. The results demonstrate that the GCF enables effective integration and utilization of DERAs&#8217; flexibility across the three LFMs, facilitating the balance between flexibility supply and demand.</description></item><item><title>An Incipient Fault Location Scheme Utilizing Synchronous Waveform Measurements in Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11264013</link><description>Incipient faults frequently occur in underground cables due to the widespread aging of power distribution infrastructure. These faults are self-clearing with short duration, posing significant challenges for accurately pinpointing their locations. This paper proposes a novel incipient fault location scheme for medium-voltage underground distribution systems in North America, leveraging synchronized waveform measurement units (WMUs). Initially, zero-sequence fault voltage models at the fault point are derived from upstream and downstream WMU measurements, incorporating system topology and parameters. Utilizing these zero-sequence fault voltage models, a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) framework is developed to estimate the fault distance for each line segment, with a whitening process applied to mitigate the effects of correlated noise. Subsequently, a candidate fault line segment is identified for each path from the substation to the end of each branch. Finally, the fault location is pinpointed within one of the candidate fault line segments, using the corresponding fault distance estimation result and the depth between the substation and candidate fault line segments, along with a truncated mean square error (MSE). The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated in PSCAD/EMTDC based on the IEEE 33-Bus and 123-Bus Test Feeders with various fault types, parameters and locations. The simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme achieves high accuracy in fault location.</description></item><item><title>DLMP-Based Congestion Management Model for Power Distribution Network Considering Network Loss and EV Charging Demand Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11237096</link><description>The uncoordinated charging of large-scale electric vehicles (EVs) tends to cause severe network congestion, posing a significant threat to the secure and reliable operation of power distribution networks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a distribution locational marginal price (DLMP) based congestion management method, utilizing differentiated congestion prices to incentivize EV aggregators (EVAs) to actively adjust charging patterns, thereby mitigating network congestion. In this model, an improved power flow method based on continuous implicit linearization is employed, which integrates network loss modeling and dynamically updates the linearization point, thus guaranteeing the accuracy of power flow approximation and price signal calculation. Moreover, both the uncertainty of EVA parameters and its impact on the safety constraints of the grid are characterized by robust ambiguity sets within the congestion management model, ensuring the reliability of the proposed pricing mechanism in guiding EV charging behavior in uncertain environments. Furthermore, a two-layer iterative algorithm is designed to facilitate bidirectional coordination between the distribution system operator (DSO) and EVAs. The outer layer updates network-related coefficient matrices to improve accuracy in grid state estimation, while the inner layer uses the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to iteratively adjust DLMPs while preserving the privacy of EVAs. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method can incentivize EV charging pattern adaptation and effectively relieve network congestion.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-View Multi-Timescale Hypergraph-Empowered Spatiotemporal Framework for EV Charging Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11251047</link><description>Accurate electric vehicle (EV) charging demand forecasting is essential for stable grid operation and proactive EV participation in electricity market. Existing forecasting methods, particularly those based on graph neural networks, are often limited to modeling pairwise relationships between stations, failing to capture the complex, group-wise dynamics inherent in urban charging networks. To address this gap, we develop a novel forecasting framework namely HyperCast, leveraging the expressive power of hypergraphs to model the higher-order spatiotemporal dependencies hidden in EV charging patterns. HyperCast integrates multi-view hypergraphs, which capture both static geographical proximity and dynamic demand-based functional similarities, along with multi-timescale inputs to differentiate between recent trends and weekly periodicities. The framework employs specialized hyper-spatiotemporal blocks and tailored cross-attention mechanisms to effectively fuse information from these diverse sources: views and timescales. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that HyperCast significantly outperforms a wide array of state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of explicitly modeling collective charging behaviors for more accurate forecasting.</description></item><item><title>A Differentially Private Energy Trading Mechanism Approaching Social Optimum</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224496</link><description>This paper proposes a differentially private energy trading mechanism for prosumers in peer-to-peer (P2P) markets, offering provable privacy guarantees while approaching the Nash equilibrium with nearly socially optimal efficiency. We first model the P2P energy trading as a (generalized) Nash game and prove the vulnerability of traditional distributed algorithms to privacy attacks through an adversarial inference model. To address this challenge, we develop a privacy-preserving Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm incorporating carefully calibrated Laplacian noise. We prove that the proposed algorithm achieves  $\epsilon $ -differential privacy while converging in expectation to the Nash equilibrium with a suitable step size. Numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the algorithm&#8217;s robustness against privacy attacks, convergence behavior, and optimality compared to the non-private solution. Results demonstrate that our mechanism effectively protects prosumers&#8217; sensitive information while maintaining near-optimal market outcomes, offering a practical approach for privacy-preserving coordination in P2P markets.</description></item><item><title>Targeted Adversarial Poisoning Attack Against Robust Aggregation in Federated Learning for Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11227121</link><description>Federated learning has been widely adopted as an intelligent computing method to leverage the power of distributed data without compromising data privacy and security, especially in smart grids. Poisoning attack is one of the common attacks against federated learning to degrade the performance of the global model or cause it to make specific, incorrect predictions. To counter these threats, secure aggregation rules have been implemented to reduce the impact of adversarial or malicious updates during training process. In this paper, we first propose a norm-based aggregation rule specifically designed to mitigate the effects of poisoning attacks within federated learning systems used for power quality classification. Subsequently, we introduce the Targeted Adversarial Poisoning Attack (TAPA), a method that aims to break the secure aggregation rule by causing the global model to misclassify a specific targeted class as another chosen class with increased success. This attack method employs a generative approach to produce extra fake data and trains a malicious model whose parameter norms closely resemble those of standard local models, thereby increasing the likelihood of these updates surviving the filtering processes of secure aggregation rules. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed TAPA method can achieve a higher poisoning attack success rate while preserving the classification accuracies of non-targeted classes, even in the presence of unbalanced data distributions. This approach underscores the potential vulnerabilities in existing secure aggregation mechanisms and highlights the need for robust defenses against sophisticated poisoning strategies in federated learning environments.</description></item><item><title>Distribution System Reconfiguration to Mitigate Load Altering Attacks via Stackelberg Games</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11227003</link><description>The widespread integration of IoT-controllable devices (e.g., smart EV charging stations and heat pumps) into modern power systems enhances capabilities but introduces critical cybersecurity risks. Specifically, these devices are susceptible to load-altering attacks (LAAs) that can compromise power system safety. This paper quantifies the impact of LAAs on nodal voltage constraint violations in distribution networks (DNs). We first present closed-form expressions to analytically characterize LAA effects and quantify the minimum number of compromised devices for a successful LAA. Based on these insights, we propose a reactive defense mechanism that mitigates LAAs through DN reconfiguration. To address strategic adversaries, we then formulate defense strategies using a non-cooperative sequential game, which models the knowledgeable and strategic attacker, accounting for the worst-case scenario and enabling the reactive defender to devise an efficient and robust defense. Further, our formulation also accounts for uncertainties in attack localization. A novel Bayesian optimization approach is introduced to compute the Stackelberg equilibrium, significantly reducing computational burden efficiently. The game-theoretic strategy effectively mitigates the attack&#8217;s impact while ensuring minimal system reconfiguration.</description></item><item><title>Generative AI-Enhanced Real-Time Anomaly Detection in Integrated Energy Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11232457</link><description>The integration of Integrated Energy Systems (IES) with main power grids is vital for enhancing the efficiency, security, and resilience of modern energy systems. However, this increased interconnectivity among energy sources, smart grids, and digital monitoring systems also exposes IES to significant cyber threats. To mitigate these risks, we have developed a framework for real-time, AI-assisted monitoring and anomaly detection, leveraging generative AI models to monitor interconnected IES within the main grid. This paper presents a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)-based prediction and anomaly detection system, specifically leveraging the Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), for secure monitoring of grid-connected IES. Our approach combines the generator&#8217;s predictive capabilities with the discriminator&#8217;s scoring mechanism to enhance anomaly detection and overall model accuracy. This allows the system to forecast the control system&#8217;s future response and detect anomalies before they manifest in real-time data. The effectiveness of this framework is assessed using an interconnected IES to the IEEE 118-bus test network. The pre-trained model is subjected to diverse attack scenarios, and experimental results consistently demonstrate its capability to identify the probability of anomalies within the IES efficiently.</description></item><item><title>Reputation Attack Detection-Based Resilient Distributed Energy Management of Cyber-Physical Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11245598</link><description>Due to potential cyber attack, it brings a great challenge for energy management of micro-grid. To address these problems, a reputation-detection-based resilient distributed energy management approach is proposed. To well detect false data injection (FDI) and denial of service (DoS) attacks, this paper presents a reputation mechanism to detect the potential cyber attack combined with acknowledgment (ACK) signal by evaluation index from its neighbor nodes. Those identified adversarial nodes can be compensated with coordinated information from high-reputation nodes. To fight against those cyber attacks, a resilient distributed optimization approach is proposed with event-triggered mechanism, which corrects those adversarial nodes with a compensation mechanism, which can ensure the convergence even under both FDI and DoS attack. According to those simulation results, it reveals that the proposed approach can converge well under both FDI and DoS attack, which can provide a promising viable approach for security-based energy management of cyber-physical micro-grid.</description></item><item><title>Generating Synthetic Net Load Data for Residential Customers With Physics-Informed Diffusion Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11245631</link><description>This paper presents a novel physics-informed diffusion model for generating synthetic net load data for residential customers, addressing the challenges of data scarcity and privacy concerns. The proposed framework embeds physical models within denoising networks, offering a versatile approach that can be readily generalized to unforeseen scenarios. A conditional denoising neural network is designed to jointly train the parameters of the transition kernel of the diffusion model and the parameters of the physics-informed function. Utilizing the real-world smart meter data from Pecan Street, we validate the proposed method and conduct a thorough numerical study comparing its performance with state-of-the-art generative models, including generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, and a well-calibrated baseline diffusion model. A comprehensive set of evaluation metrics is used to assess the accuracy and diversity of the generated synthetic net load data. The numerical study results demonstrate that the proposed physics-informed diffusion model outperforms state-of-the-art models across all quantitative metrics, yielding at least 20% improvement. To justify the practical value of synthetic data, we show that the synthetic net load data generated by our proposed model yields superior results than the benchmark models using power flow and dynamic hosting capacity analysis.</description></item><item><title>Redesigning the Decoder and Loss Function of Diffusion Transformer for PV Temporal Simulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224017</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) temporal simulation is a core technology for PV planning analysis.

Existing methods are limited by coarse-resolution weather data and insufficient modeling of spatiotemporal dependencies. We propose a novel framework that combines bias-corrected high-resolution weather data with an Adaptive Fourier Graph Neural Network (PV-AFGNN) to capture complex spatial and temporal patterns. A Gated recurrent unit (GRU)-based encoder-decoder module refines Numerical Weather Prediction forecasts using local meteorological data, generating site-specific inputs for PV-AFGNN, which operates in the Fourier domain to model correlations efficiently. By jointly optimizing weather data correction and spatiotemporal learning, the framework achieves high accuracy even under challenging forecasting scenarios. Experiments on real-world multi-site PV datasets show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, offering a scalable and robust solution for reliable energy scheduling, and enhanced integration of PV power into modern electricity systems.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Residential Short-Term Load Forecasting With Missing Data Tolerance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11262200</link><description>Traditional data-driven residential short-term load forecasting methods are faced with two major challenges, i.e., preserving data privacy and addressing missing data. Regarding privacy-preserving, a new two-stage pre-training personalized federated learning framework is proposed to train customized forecasting models with high forecasting accuracy for all households without violating their data privacy. As for the missing data problem, an advanced semi-supervised graph diffusion network model is proposed to address missing &#8220;features&#8221; and &#8220;labels&#8221; problems, where &#8220;features&#8221; and &#8220;labels&#8221; refer to the required input data of the forecasting model and actual load data of the forecasting day, respectively. Mathematically, a graph feature diffusion mechanism-based feature input and imputation module is developed to mitigate the deficiency imposed by missing &#8220;features&#8221;. Next, a graph convolutional network-based semi-supervised feature augmented and update module is established to mitigate the negative effects of missing &#8220;labels&#8221;. An actual power system in China is employed to demonstrate the proposed method, and simulation results indicate that high forecasting accuracy and strong robustness under missing data scenarios are achieved.</description></item><item><title>Zero-Shot Nonintrusive Load Monitoring via Contrastive Learning-Based Multiscale Dual-Path Temporal Fusion Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11262199</link><description>Nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM) aims to disaggregate household power usage into individual appliance consumption, enabling efficient demand management. However, existing models struggle with scenarios where only aggregate power sequences are available in the target domain without any individual appliance labels for fine-tuning (i.e., zero-shot), which causes significant performance degradation and limits their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model named contrastive learning-based multiscale dual-path temporal fusion network (CL-MDTFN). CL-MDTFN integrates an energy-aware subsampling embedding block for multiscale feature extraction and a residual power decoupling block for capturing both fine-grained transient activities and overarching load trends. By leveraging the autocorrelation contrastive loss, CL-MDTFN effectively learns the long-term variations of the signals, enabling accurate load disaggregation in unlabeled households. Experiments on U.K.-DALE and REDD demonstrate that CL-MDTFN outperforms existing NILM models in fully labeled and unlabeled scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Tensor Decomposition Personalized Federated Learning for Ultra-Short-Term Load Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11251317</link><description>Accurate ultra-short-term load forecasting is crucial for the optimal scheduling and efficient operation of power systems. Traditional centralized collaborative modeling methods rely on cross-domain data aggregation, which poses significant data security risks. Meanwhile, existing federated learning approaches suffer from slow global model convergence and high communication costs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving tensor decomposition-based personalized federated learning method (PP-TDPFed) for ultra-short-term load forecasting. First, a novel tensorized local model is designed using tensor decomposition techniques to reduce communication costs. Second, a dual-layer loss function is introduced to decouple the personalized model from the tensorized local model by controlling the distance between them, enabling personalized optimization. Finally, leveraging the tensorized characteristics of model parameters, an efficient distributed learning algorithm and an aggregating composed tensor strategy are developed to enable global model aggregation and updating. Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, the proposed method demonstrates superior robustness and generalization capability while achieving rapid convergence. It effectively reduces communication costs during training and enhances the stability of ultra-short-term load forecasting.</description></item><item><title>High-Risk Lines Identification Under Manipulation of Demand Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11298508</link><description>Manipulation of Demand (MAD) attacks leverage compromised high-wattage IoT devices on the public Internet to generate abnormal loads, thereby inducing severe transmission line overloads, effectively bypassing deployed cyber defense mechanisms for Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems in the private network.

However, current methods face three limitations like reliance on manual similarity measures, high computational costs, and inflexibility to new load profiles. To address these challenges, this letter proposes a large-scale anchor graph-based subspace clustering method for residential load profiling. Specifically, the distance matrix is directly learned from the load profile through subspace clustering to handle high-dimensional data and uncover hidden load patterns. Then, an anchor graph is constructed to capture the intrinsic structure of the learned subspace, which can effectively reduce the computational complexity. Finally, k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is adopted to assign labels to new load profiles based on selected anchor points, eliminating the need for re-clustering the entire dataset.

Multiple UAV owners participate and collaboratively offer UaaS to the end-users. In the process, a UAV with limited resources offloads the task to other UAVs with adequate resources. However, not all the UAVs are trustworthy to offload the task. In such a case, we need to evaluate the trust of those UAVs to whom another UAV wishes to offload the task. The proposed trust evaluation scheme, TOFU, consists of three components &#8211; (i) residual energy, (ii) data transmission rate, and (iii) reputation of a UAV. The residual energy and data transmission are the pre-determined components retrieved directly. On the other hand, we need to compute the reputation of a UAV specific to the UaaS environment. We consider the resources available with a UAV to determine its initial reputation. Further, we apply the debit-credit system to compute the reputation value. When a UAV offloads a task, its reputation is debited from its total reputation. On the other hand, the reputation is credited to that UAV to which the task is offloaded. We apply a reputation transfer-based bargaining game while prioritizing the UAVs with higher capability. In particular, we adopt Rubinstein bargaining model to evaluate the trust of the UAVs and design an incentivized offloading mechanism. We use the concept of Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) to decide an optimal amount of reputation to be transferred between two UAVs. The game is modeled in a way that encourages UAVs with lower reputations to participate in the game by making them more patient so that they can negotiate for higher fractions of reputation. Simulation results show that TOFU reduces delay and energy consumption per task by up to 1.74% and 2%, respectively. Additionally, TOFU reduces task failure rate by approximately 9% as compared to the traditional approaches such as DeTTO, DPTO, and SOA, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Path Tracking Control Method With Trailer Additional Yaw-Moment Control for Semi-Trailer Trucks on High-Curvature Paths</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11150472</link><description>This paper proposes an innovative path tracking control method with trailer additional yaw-moment control for semi-trailer trucks on high-curvature paths.

The validity of the proposed method is evaluated by a hardware-in-the-loop platform, where the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more effective and robust than the existing baseline control methods.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing User Experience and Energy Efficiency in Metaverse Play to Earn Games via Mobile Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11146578</link><description>The burgeoning interest in the Metaverse has captured the attention of both academic and commercial sectors, largely due to the decentralization of the security and authenticity of digital assets. This has notably accelerated the popularity of play-to-earn (P2E) games, where participants can earn and own digital assets that are exchangeable for real-world currencies. These games, however, are computationally demanding and often not feasible on devices with limited resources, necessitating computational offloading to edge servers. Through mobile edge computing (MEC), data can be processed on Metaverse Service Provider (MSP) edge servers. A key challenge arises in balancing the latency perceived by users, which can affect gameplay, the visual experience that impacts potential earnings, and the energy consumption of user devices. Lowering the resolution of downlink transmissions can reduce latency but also diminishes visual quality, consequently affecting user earnings. To address these challenges, our research introduces a comprehensive multi-objective optimization framework that incorporates latency, visual quality, and energy consumption for Metaverse-based mobile augmented reality (MAR) games. Given the NP-hardness of this optimization challenge, we offer simple yet effective optimization algorithms to mitigate the trade-offs between delay and financial returns. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed methodology effectively balances perceived latency, visual quality, and energy consumption, thereby enhancing both the user experience and the sustainability of Metaverse-based MAR systems.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Caching-Assisted Inter-Satellite Cooperative Computation Offloading in LEO Satellite Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11144472</link><description>Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite edge computing network (LSECN) can complement the advantages of terrestrial networks and provide users with ubiquitous services. Currently, the majority of research on task software caching primarily concentrates on statically caching data at the network edge. However, in reality, user requests are time-varying, which makes it difficult to maintain high reusability. Therefore, this paper considers dynamic caching of task software in the mobile edge computing (MEC) servers to assist users in processing tasks. Tasks can be processed locally or offloaded to the LSECN to achieve on-board load balancing through inter-satellite cooperation. Specifically, considering the limited caching size and computing capabilities of MEC servers and the time-varying task requirements of users, a joint task software caching update and computation offloading problem is constructed to minimize the system cost, defined as the weighted sum of system delay and energy consumption, while ensuring resource constraints. To solve the above problem, we propose a computation offloading strategy and caching scheme based on twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm, which significantly reduces the system cost and has excellent convergence performance.</description></item><item><title>Performance Enhancement for CNN-Based Classification of Low Probability of Intercept Radar Signals With Pulse Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11145921</link><description>In electronic warfare, technologies that accurately detect the adversary's location and signal characteristics to execute precise strikes or effectively jam signals are crucial assets. To meet these capabilities, low probability of intercept (LPI) radars are employed, which transmit low-power signals and utilize various modulation techniques to minimize the probability of signal detection. Previous studies presented an approach for classifying LPI radar waveforms using a convolutional neural network (CNN) with time-frequency images (TFIs). Even though they have shown higher identification performance than that of the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques, they did not consider the inherent characteristics of radar systems, such as repetitive pulse transmissions and the interceptor's limited knowledge of the start of pulses. Motivated by the limitations, this paper proposes a framework that converts multiple intercepted signals into images and extracts multiple features through a CNN to improve the classification performance with a more realistic LPI dataset constructed under timing errors. To validate the performance of the proposed framework, we consider various CNNs with different combinations of feature extraction methods and backbone networks. We provide a quantitative analysis of the advantage of pulse integration. Furthermore, the experimental results clearly demonstrated that the proposed framework achieved a 18.2% accuracy improvement at $-10$ dB and a 26% improvement at $-12$ dB, compared to the conventional scheme without pulse integration.</description></item><item><title>On the Terminal Location Uncertainty in Elliptical Footprints: Application in Air-to-Ground Links</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11150748</link><description>Wireless transmitters (Txs) that radiate downward in a direction often generate circular footprints on the ground. The configurational flexibility of these footprints is inherently limited as coverage adjustments are restricted to variations in radius, the only parameter available for tuning. This simplification is inadequate for scenarios that require asymmetric coverage, extended service areas, or dynamic footprint adaptation due to antenna tilt or changes in altitude of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In specific scenarios, the use of elliptical cells can offer increased flexibility for providing user coverage due to unique network characteristics. For example, an elliptical footprint can be produced when a practical directional antenna with unequal azimuth and elevation half-power beamwidths is used in high-speed railway networks. Another common scenario involves the production of an elliptical footprint when an airborne Tx radiates at an angle by tilting its directional antenna by a few degrees. This paper aims to investigate for the first time the association between the random location of the user within an elliptical coverage area and the performance of a wireless communication link considering these scenarios. We assume a UAV as a Tx, although a tall cellular base station tower could also be employed without losing generality. To gain a deeper understanding of the impact of random location, we derive the relevant distance and signal-to-noise ratio metrics and examine the outage probability for a single-user link, as well as the throughput in a multiuser scenario. This analysis accounts for both random terminal locations and fading impairments in both cases. The findings provide valuable insights into the performance of comparable wireless systems.</description></item><item><title>Channel-Adaptive Privacy Enhancement for NOMA-Based Antagonistic Overlay Cognitive Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153544</link><description>Overlay cognitive networks based on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can introduce substantial privacy concerns, especially in antagonistic systems where primary and secondary networks lack mutual trust. This paper highlights two critical privacy challenges and investigates a NOMA-assisted purely antagonistic overlay cognitive network. As part of our privacy design, we propose a Channel-Adaptive Dual-Phase Cooperative Jamming (CADP-CJ) strategy, leveraging reverse successive interference cancellation and a dynamic top-down power allocation approach based on the available channel-state information. The ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) for both single-user and multi-user scenarios is derived in closed form by means of Taylor-McLaurin expansions and Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature, while considering Nakagami-$m$ fading across all channels. Furthermore, the closed-form expressions for the asymptotic ESR are presented to provide deeper insights. The accuracy of our analytical results is corroborated through Monte-Carlo simulations, which also confirm that our scheme ensures a positive ESR in both single and multi-user cases. We comprehensively analyze the impact of the fading properties of the channels involved and comment on optimal jamming power using the CADP-CJ strategy. Notably, our proposed system outperforms benchmark systems, particularly those based on orthogonal multiple access, with an 86% enhancement for primary users and 64% for secondary users.</description></item><item><title>Covert Communication in Multi-User ISAC Systems: Joint Beamforming and Jamming Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153710</link><description>This paper investigates covert communication in multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where a base station (BS) detects target and secretly transmits confidential signals to multiple users under the surveillance of an adversarial warden (Willie), and a mobile friendly jammer is deployed to transmit jamming signals to enhance covertness. The closed-form expression of Willie's detection error probability (DEP) is derived as a metric of covertness performance, and the joint beamforming and jamming power optimization problem is formulated to balance sensing performance and average covert transmission rate. Considering both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) scenarios, a two-step algorithm composed of Rayleigh quotient derivation and successive convex approximation (SCA) is proposed to solve the non-convex multi-variable problem. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical analysis, and demonstrate the benefits of a jammer to the covertness of the ISAC system compared with max ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) methods.</description></item><item><title>Model Lightweight Strategy Under Federated Edge Learning Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11146606</link><description>Mobile communication devices such as mobile phones and autonomous driving in car systems are ubiquitous.The energy and computing power of existing mobile devices are limited. The energy consumption of local training in federated learning is significant. To reduce computational energy consumption, we propose a lightweight federated edge learning framework for client models. We attempted to extract a small model suitable for execution on mobile devices from a large federated global model trained on edge servers. Directly training the small model would involve multiple transmissions of local models, leading to a shift of energy consumption from computation to communication. We aim to transfer more computation to edge servers. To this end, we design a pseudo vector compression method to reduce data transmission energy consumption. The framework enables most model training to be moved to edge servers while also ensuring the accuracy and reducing the energy consumption of client models. In addition, we prune and adjust the model parameters of the lightweight model to make it more personalized. We also provided a convergence analysis of our algorithm and proved that our algorithm is convergent. The experimental results indicate that our proposed framework and algorithm not only reduce computational costs of mobile devices but also ensure the availability of local lightweight models.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Computing and Multicasting Optimization for Live 360-Degree Video Streaming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11146920</link><description>Virtual reality (VR) technology is widely employed across various domains, with its applications expanding as Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies advance, bringing new scenarios and functionalities to 360-degree video streaming. However, these applications impose substantial demands on computational power and communication capacity, along with increased sensitivity to computation and transmission delay. In this paper, we propose a joint optimization scheme of computing and multicasting for 360-degree video in Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) networks to maximize the long-term Quality of Experience (QoE) of multiple users. We solve the computing and multicasting optimization problem separately by dividing it into adaptive grouping and resource optimization subproblems. By implementing adaptive grouping, we reduce redundant computation and transmission, thereby improving the efficiency of limited resource utilization. We propose a Cooperative Bargaining Game (CBG)-based resource allocation algorithm for efficient resource management and a Lyapunov optimization-based bitrate adaptation algorithm for long-term performance optimization, enhancing users' QoE while minimizing playback freezing. Our experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in multi-user long-term QoE, average bitrate, and reduced rebuffering time, underscoring the effectiveness of our scheme in demanding scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Mobile Edge Computing Based Intelligent Charging Strategy for Electric Vehicles in Cyber Physical Energy System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11146906</link><description>The development of intelligent transportation systems has promoted the application of wireless technology in vehicular communication networks and mobile services. At the same time, electric vehicles are popular due to their environmental-friendliness and cost-saving characteristics. However, charging of electric vehicles without proper and real-time rules may cause serious traffic congestion and high expense, which results in unnecessary charging stations and wasted power generation with high carbon emission. Therefore, it is crucial to design an efficient charging strategy for electric vehicles without causing road congestion, together with an economic dispatch strategy to offer proper power generation and decarbonization. In this paper, we introduce mobile edge computing architecture to enhance real-time response capabilities through edge device positioning data. This approach allows charging strategies to swiftly adapt to varying road conditions and user demands, effectively mitigating traffic congestion. Regarding the forecasting of load demand for charging stations, this paper employs a deep learning model based on informer and deploys it on edge servers, quickly providing accurate demand predictions for economic dispatching and enhancing the precision of scheduling strategies. With the application of deep reinforcement learning models, the system can formulate efficient charging plans based on real-time user data, improving user satisfaction and quality of services. Numerical results show the efficiency of the obtained strategies for electric vehicles charging and power economic dispatching, and the two-stage modeling approach significantly improves the convergence of the model and the quality of the solution.</description></item><item><title>Computation Offloading for Distributed Learning in Vehicular Networks: A Service Scheduling and Resource Allocation Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11150601</link><description>Distributed machine learning has attracted significant attention for the future vehicular networks. However, the inadequate computation capacity of multi-vehicles and the dynamic wireless communication environment degrade the training effectiveness of distributed models. Against these backdrops, a novel end-edge-cloud collaborative computation offloading for distributed learning paradigm is proposed in this paper. In order to minimize the weighted sum cost of latency and learning loss, we jointly optimize the offloading decisions for access selection and the proportion of data offloading, as well as the resource allocation strategy for bandwidth and transmit power. Wherein, the straggler effect is addressed by formulating a dynamic short timescale problem based on service fairness and a combinatorial iterative approach is suggested to resolve this min-max problem. Then, over the long timescale, the modified multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm based on multiple base stations and users is developed to overcome the dilemma of the missing explicit relationship between optimization variables and learning loss function. Moreover, a fractional programming (FP) based MARL algorithm is designed to solve this NP-hard issue. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed FP-MARL algorithm in comparison to the benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>QoE-Aware User Allocation in NOMA-Enabled MEC Systems: A Distributed Game-Theoretical Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11154945</link><description>In vehicular networks, mobile edge computing (MEC) allows service providers to allocate vehicle terminals (VTs) to edge servers, providing an effective paradigm for low latency computing services. In resources-limited edge computing scenarios, user allocation needs to achieve the goals of minimizing deployment costs and maximizing coverage density while ensuring service quality. However, the differentiated configuration of user power in non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology can cause intra-cell and inter-cell interference within the same frequency band, resulting in a significant decrease in transmission rate and a reduction in Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we study the QoE-aware user and power allocation (QUPA) problem with multiple users in a NOMA-enabled MEC system aimed at maximizing users' QoE. We formulate this problem as a QUPA game and theoretically analyze its properties. To achieve the Nash equilibrium for each user, we propose a distributed game-theoretical user and power allocation (GUPA) algorithm that jointly optimizes server selection, channel selection, and transmission power allocation. Meanwhile, we theoretically analyze the convergence and performance by price of anarchy (PoA) of our GUPA algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed GUPA algorithm can effectively reduce costs and improve user experience in this system.</description></item><item><title>Secrecy Rate Maximization for Coupled Phase-Shift STAR-RIS-Assisted ISAC Networks Under Dual Eavesdropping Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11144762</link><description>This article investigates a secure coupled phase-shift simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) network, where a base station (BS) utilizes the STAR-RIS to enable simultaneous communication with a user and target detection on opposite sides, while the transmitted signals are exposed to interception by communication and sensing eavesdroppers. We aim to maximize the secrecy rate of the communication user by jointly optimizing the BS beamforming and the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficients, while ensuring the constraints on BS power, coupled STAR-RIS transmission and reflection coefficients, sensing performance, and sensing security. To tackle the non-convex problem, we propose an optimization algorithm that combines successive convex approximation (SCA) and penalty dual decomposition (PDD). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves superior performance compared to the benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>DRL-Based Energy Harvesting for RIS-Assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems With Electromagnetic Interference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11146925</link><description>Electromagnetic interference (EMI) poses a significant negative impact on reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communications. In contrast, in this correspondence, we harness EMI for energy harvesting (EH) in RIS-assisted cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems. The proposed scheme achieves energy-efficient RISs by employing a dynamic time-division strategy to split the time into transmission and EH phases. It promotes environmentally sustainable communication by efficiently harnessing the power of EMI and access points (APs). Specifically, we jointly optimize the precoding of APs, the phase shifts of RISs, and transmission time scheduling to maximize EH while satisfying the required quality of service (QoS) for users. Due to the non-convex and non-linear nature of the problem, arising from the intricate coupling of optimization variables, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm based on the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) is proposed for robust system performance. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme effectively reduces the negative effects of EMI and optimally utilizes the power of EMI, especially in scenarios with severe EMI.</description></item><item><title>Artificial Noise With Network Coding for Securing NOMA-Assisted Cooperative Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11150600</link><description>We investigate security-reliability tradeoff (SRT) for a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-aided cooperative network, where an internal untrusted far user (UFU) intercepts transmission from source to trusted near user (TNU), and an external eavesdropper (Eve) overhears transmission from source to UFU and TNU. To prevent eavesdropping, an artificial noise (AN)-aided network coding (ANANC) scheme is presented and exact expressions of outage probabilities (OPs), intercept probabilities (IPs), and transmission secrecy outage probabilities (TSOPs) are derived for NOMA users. For comparison, the simulation results of AN without network coding (ANWNC) scheme and non-AN (NAN) scheme are presented. Numerical results show that: 1) the IPs of TNU by the ANANC scheme is lower than that by the ANWNC and NAN schemes slightly deteriorating OP; 2) UFU by the ANANC, ANWNC, and NAN schemes achieves almost the same OP and NAN scheme performs the worst IP performance; 3) SRT of TNU by the ANANC scheme is superior to ANWNC and NAN schemes without damaging SRT for UFU compared to the ANWNC scheme but being better than that of the NAN scheme; 4) secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) of TNU by the ANANC scheme performs better than that of the ANWNC and NAN schemes but has a negligible impact on UFU in a high transmit power region, while both NOMA users have comparable SEE to ANWNC and NAN schemes in a low transmit power region.</description></item><item><title>Performance Analysis of Sub-Nyquist Wideband Spectrum Sensing Over Fading Channels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11150720</link><description>This paper studies the performance of wideband spectrum sensing (WBSS) with sub-Nyquist sampling in cognitive networks. Considering the limitations posed by expensive and power-hungry analog-to-digital converters for Nyquist sampling approaches and high-computational complexity for compressed sensing approaches, this paper focuses on performing WBSS directly from aliased subbands with limited samples in a cost-effective and computationally efficient manner, and understanding the relationship between downsampling rates and sensing performance. To address the aliasing effect caused by sub-Nyquist sampling, bin detection is used to evaluate the channel occupancy. Moreover, the sensing performance is analyzed over fading channels in terms of probabilities of miss detection, false alarm, insufficient spectrum opportunity, and excessive interference opportunity. The results show that sub-Nyquist sampling can achieve WBSS without full spectrum recovery, thus reducing the sensing overhead and computational complexity.</description></item><item><title>Exploiting Polarization Domain of the IOS for Enhanced Full-Dimensional Transmission</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11164485</link><description>Intelligent omni-surface (IOS), capable of providing service coverage to mobile users (MUs) in a reflective and refractive manner, has recently attracted widespread attention. However, the performance of power-domain IOS-assisted systems is limited by the intimate coupling between the refraction and reflection behavior of IOS elements. In this paper, we introduce the concept of dual-polarized IOS-assisted communication to overcome this challenge. By employing the polarization domain in the design of IOS, full independent refraction and reflection modes can be delivered. We consider a downlink dual-polarized IOS-aided system while also accounting for the leakage between different polarizations. To maximize the sum rate, we formulated a joint base station (BS) digital and IOS analog beamforming problem and proposed an iterative algorithm to solve the non-convex program. Simulation results validate that dual-polarized IOS significantly enhances the performance than that of the power-domain one.</description></item><item><title>STAR-RIS Assisted Hybrid Far- and Near-Field SWIPT</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11143906</link><description>A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) assisted hybrid far- and near-field (HFNF) simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) framework is proposed, where the energy users are located in the near-field region while the information users are located in the far-field region. The weighted harvested power of near-field energy users is maximized by jointly optimizing the active beamforming of base station (BS) and the passive beamforming of STAR-RIS, subject to the communication quality of far-field communication users. To solve this non-convex problem, a two-layer penalty-based algorithm is proposed. For the inner layer, the concave-convex procedure (CCCP) technique is invoked to address non-convex difference-of-convex (DC) expressions. For the outer layer, the penalized approach is used to guarantee the rank-1 solution. Numerical results show that: 1) the proposed algorithm achieves significant energy harvesting enhancement; 2) the STAR-RIS outperforms both reflecting-only and transmitting-only RIS; and 3) in contrast to far-field beamformers, near-field beamformers enable energy to be concentrated directly around energy users, thereby improving energy harvesting performance.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Dense Base Station Deployment for Resilient Communication Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11145914</link><description>Communication networks are of critical importance to modern societies. However, they are often susceptible to disruption due to natural disasters, which can have significant economic and social impacts. In order, to mitigate the aforementioned impacts, a novel spatio-temporal risk-based optimization framework for designing disaster-resilient communication networks is introduced. This framework addresses both cost-effectiveness and risk minimization in a unified manner. The effects of physical damage, power disruption, and recovery dynamics on the outage probability over time are incorporated into a dual-objective optimization model. A key innovation is the incorporation of spatial heterogeneity, which enables region-specific base station density allocation that reflect spatial variations in seismic intensity. The proposed framework, which utilizes a convex optimization strategy and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions, achieves optimal resource allocation while satisfying cost and risk constraints. This methodology has been demonstrated to enhance network resilience in high-risk regions while incurring no additional costs, thus providing a scalable and adaptable solution applicable to a variety types of natural hazards and geographic contexts.</description></item><item><title>Effect of Laser Cutting Procedures on Overall Performance of N-Type TOPCon Silicon Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11364251</link><description>Today, as the most well-developed photovoltaic (PV) technology, silicon-based solar cells still dominate the PV market. In order to further maximize the power output of the PV modules, it is vital to cut the full solar cells into half-size cells. An increase of 3% in overall power output can often be seen for the half-cell PV modules. However, the solar cell splitting process, which is usually conducted by laser cutting, inevitably causes structural damage and power conversion efficiency loss to the cut cells. The overall performance of the cut solar cell is greatly dependent on the laser cutting scenario. How the laser cutting parameters, such as cutting technique and cutting direction influence the performance of the solar cell is still under debate. In this work, commercial efficient N-type TOPCon solar cells were subjected to laser scribe and mechanical cleaving and thermal laser separation from different cutting side, respectively, to comprehensively investigate the effect of laser cutting procedures on the overall performance of the cells.</description></item><item><title>Impact of NaF Precursor Layer Thickness on Submicrometer Rear-passivated Coevaporated CIGS Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11381898</link><description>Rear interface passivation on submicrometer Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells through nanopatterned dielectric layers has enabled performance gains. The combined optimization of the rear contact interface and the absorber properties enables high-efficiency ultrathin CIGS solar cells. However, the absorber quality of a standard thin 2000 nm CIGS has not been suitably maintained in absorbers with thickness values around 500 nm. Establishing an optimized Na doping, absorber crystallinity, and bandgap profile on such submicrometer CIGS solar cells has been challenging. Moreover, the Na doping may also be influenced by the rear contact architectures implemented in passivated solar cells, e.g., affecting the diffusion of Na from the soda-lime glass. Nonetheless, a proper Na supply into CIGS is critical for an optimized absorber quality. Therefore, this study evaluates the impact of the amount of Na supply controlled through a NaF precursor layer on a rear passivated ultrathin CIGS solar cell. The NaF layer thickness leading to the best performance solar cells in this study, attributed to high absorber crystallinity and low ordered vacancy compound content, is lower than that used in standard thin 2000 nm cells. It suggests that the transition to ultrathin solar cells is not straightforward, and the cell architecture influences the conditions to reach the optimum absorber properties.</description></item><item><title>Nonuniform Luminescence Changes Under Illumination and Applied Voltage in Perovskite Photovoltaic Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11372191</link><description>The nonuniform luminescence changes were investigated under illumination and applied voltage in perovskite photovoltaic (PV) modules. The intensity of photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL) intensities gradually decreased under illumination and applied voltage, respectively, which could be due to ion migration. This is implied by the metastable behavior of the device: the power decreased under illumination and recovered after dark storage. The rate of decrease in PL and EL intensities was different for each subsolar cell, indicating the nonuniform performance of perovskite solar cells in the module. In addition, the EL image after dark storage shows a speckle pattern and a decrease in the bright EL spots under the applied voltage. These changes indicate that the interface between the perovskite and charge-transport layer may not recover uniformly during dark storage. These results indicate that transient luminescence imaging to evaluate the presence of inhomogeneous layers, such as the absorbers, can contribute to the understanding of the degradation of perovskite PVs.</description></item><item><title>An Approach for Modeling, Simulation, and Parameter Estimation of Half-Cell Bifacial PV Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11364221</link><description>Bifacial modules have gained prominence due to their ability to capture additional energy from rear-side irradiance. However, models and parameter estimation methods for bifacial modules remain limited largely due to varying interpretations of rear irradiance effects. An approach to address that issue is the standardization of models in line with the IEC TS 60904-1-2 standard. This study proposes a bifacial module model based on that standard featuring two current sources, each representing front and rear irradiances, and introduces bifaciality coefficient as a new parameter to be estimated. A conventional half-cell bifacial photovoltaic module with 655 W was tested in a solar simulator, and the resulting data were used for simulations and parameter estimation of the proposed model by a mean&#8211;variance mapping optimization algorithm. According to the results, the model can effectively estimate the parameters and represent the bifacial photovoltaic module comprehensively due to its low error rates and a strong fit to $I$&#8211;$V$ and $P$&#8211;$V$ curves. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis revealed the incorporation of the new parameter does not affect the identifiability of the model.</description></item><item><title>Lifetime Prediction of TOPCon Modules Based on Accelerated Damp Heat Life Tests</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11361318</link><description>Tunnel oxide passivation contacts (TOPCon) solar cells have revealed a high-performance efficiency and become mainstream product in global photovoltaic (PV) market. Nevertheless, there are still concerns about the reliability and durability of TOPCon modules, particularly in damp and heat conditions. Current lifetime prediction models for TOPCon modules lack adaptability to complex environmental stressors and rapid degradation feedback, limiting their utility in guiding material selection and process optimization. To address this gap, we developed a robust accelerated aging model by combining an improved Peck model with a sigmoidal degradation function, which explicitly incorporates critical factors such as internal humidity and temperature within the module. The model incorporates a particle swarm optimization algorithm to calibrate activation energy and humidity sensitivity parameters, enabling precise simulation of degradation trajectories. Validated through a &#8220;fitting + testing&#8221; framework, the model demonstrates high accuracy (RMSE = 0.7%) in predicting power degradation under damp heat, highly accelerated stress test, and modified pressure cooker test conditions. The results of our designed accelerated aging tests reveal that DH-induced degradation primarily reduces fill factor due to finger corrosion, with minimal impact on Voc and Isc. Modules encapsulated with polyolefin elastomer exhibit superior corrosion resistance, achieving a projected service lifetime 23 years longer than EVA/EVA encapsulated in high-humidity regions like Hainan, China. This article bridges the critical gap in TOPCon module lifetime prediction under extreme environments and provides actionable insights for optimizing encapsulation materials and enhancing long-term reliability. The proposed model offers a scalable framework for industry stakeholders to evaluate module performance under site-specific climatic conditions, accelerating the development of durable PV technologies.</description></item><item><title>Partial Shading Losses in Half-Cut PV Modules: Experiments, Circuit Simulation, and an Analytical Loss Function</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11313241</link><description>This study establishes an integrated approach to quantify partial shading losses in commercial half-cut photovoltaic modules. Systematic indoor experiments were conducted on a 440 W c-Si half-cut module, providing current-voltage data under controlled shading. The data were used to calibrate a detailed LTspice circuit model. Further, an analytical loss function was developed to predict power losses as a function of shaded substring fraction and configuration. This analytical loss function was then refined through empirical fitting to the experimentally validated LTspice model, and it closely matches both the designed simulation conditions used for data fitting and independent representative shading scenarios. This framework offers a reliable and efficient tool for predicting shading losses in series-connected half-cut PV modules, facilitating more accurate system design and performance assessment.</description></item><item><title>Thermal-Aware Tracking for Photovoltaics: Reducing Module Degradation Without Sacrificing Yield</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11381435</link><description>Elevated operating temperatures for photovoltaic modules remain a critical challenge for PV systems, particularly in regions with high irradiance. High temperatures lower efficiency and accelerate module degradation. Single-axis trackers generally rely on algorithms that maximize irradiance capture. To tackle the dual challenge of maximizing production while preventing overheating, we propose a thermal-aware tracking algorithm. The method substantially reduces module temperatures during inverter clipping, a common occurrence in PV systems with high dc/ac ratios. By moderating plane-of-array irradiance (POAI) only when excess power cannot be exported, the algorithm reduces the module temperature without compromising energy yield. Validation using an advanced thermal model that accounts for wind-driven convection and radiative exchange with the sky shows that, under the climatic and operational conditions in Chile, the algorithm performs best when panels are oriented closer to horizontal. Implemented on a solar tracker in northern Chile, the algorithm achieved module temperature reductions of up to 7.7&#8201;&#176;C along with decreased UV exposure, enhancing thermal performance without compromising system output and thereby improving efficiency while minimizing degradation.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Analysis of PyroCb Lightning Leader Impacts on PV Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11303118</link><description>Pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) thunderstorms from intense bushfires are major lightning sources, igniting secondary fires and damaging electrical infrastructure. Unlike conventional lightning surge studies based on generic thunderstorm conditions, this study develops a novel modeling framework rooted in atmospheric pyroCb thundercloud dynamics. A numerical model is employed to simulate downward leader propagation in pyroCb lightning via the dielectric breakdown model, explicitly coupling charge structure, wind-shear-driven displacement, and leader dynamics with surge analysis. Results show wind shear extensions of 0&#8211;12 km significantly influence charge distribution and lightning type, shifting from intracloud to negative cloud-to-ground (&#8211;CG) discharges as initiation potential changes from 49.34 MV (4 km extension) to &#8211;450.69 MV (12 km extension). Findings indicate that CG flashes predominantly strike within 26&#8211;27 km, emphasizing charge density variations in leader development. The extracted return stroke current, peaking at 350 kA, is modeled as a MATLAB time-series function and applied to a grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) system to analyze surge effects. Results show pyroCb lightning surges propagate through electrical networks, causing extreme overvoltages, equipment failure, and operational disruptions. By directly linking pyroCb atmospheric processes with renewable energy infrastructure response, this study makes the first integrated assessment of bushfire-driven lightning surges on PV systems. These findings emphasize the need to assess renewable energy infrastructure vulnerabilities to extreme weather-driven lightning events. By clarifying leader dynamics and surge impacts, this study advances lightning protection research and highlights the importance of robust mitigation strategies to safeguard electrical systems against pyroCb lightning hazards.</description></item><item><title>Defining Solar Farm Lifetime From Techno-economic Indicators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11348952</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) system design and project viability are conventionally decided based on the assumptions: &#8220;end of life at 80% capacity&#8221; and &#8220;20&#8211;25 year system life.&#8221; These heuristic assumptions decouple the local financial context from long-term technical performance dynamics, obscuring the technoeconomic optimal in the decision aiding analyses. In this article, we present a technoeconomics driven framework to explain the project lifetime of PV farms. The levelized cost of energy (LCOE) varies with the chosen project lifetime, and we show that there is an optimum operational life of the PV system where LCOE is minimum. We compare the fixed-rate degradation (FRD) model to a realistic degradation (RD) profile to quantify LCOE and optimal project lifetimes. FRD significantly overestimates the optimum lifetime. For a baseline system reaching 80% capacity in 25 years (&#8220;technical lifetime&#8221;), the FRD model predicts an unrealistic optimum life of 58 years, whereas the RD model yields 32 years at 2.5% interest rate and 2% inflation rate. We study the variation in optimum lifetimes for different interest/discount rates, inflation, and technical lifetime. While optimum lifetime increases as each of these parameters increase, LCOE only goes up with the economic rates. Our results indicate, in certain local conditions, it may be possible that the optimum is lower than the technical lifetime&#8212;i.e., it would then be better to set the system decommissioning date even before the warranty. By bridging realistic system performance with LCOE analysis to identify the year of minimum LCOE, our approach provides investors and policymakers with a robust metric to maximize financial returns and decide when to decommission.</description></item><item><title>A Linear Programming Approach to Backtracking for Single-Axis Trackers on Rolling Terrain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11327451</link><description>In this article, we present a computationally efficient method for determining optimal backtracking rotations for single-axis solar trackers on nonuniform terrain. The method allows for ganged tracking, mechanical rotation constraints, uneven row spacing, and arbitrary maximum allowable shaded fractions (to enable &#8220;fractional backtracking&#8221;). As with previous 2-D approaches, the method is suitable for terrain that varies in the transverse direction with respect to the rotation axis of the trackers. The novelty of the method lies in formulating the problem of shade avoidance as a linear problem, which is achieved by using the row interception width as the optimization variable instead of rotation angles. Formulating backtracking as a linear problem enables the use of extremely efficient linear programming algorithms, making the method highly scalable, requiring less than 1 min to compute optimal rotation schedules for hundreds of trackers. It also produces more effective backtracking rotations, reducing the frequency of shading by 4&#215; and improving system energy output by 1%&#8211;2%.</description></item><item><title>Using Open-Source Forecasts for Solar Plant Maintenance Outage Scheduling Can Reduce Lost Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11345810</link><description>Solar plant operators have to schedule outages for periodic maintenance, where plants or subsets of plants are shut down. Outages can last many hours to several days and result in lost energy generation. Scheduling outages one or more days in advance may be required for staffing purposes and to provide adequate notification to grid operators. Because solar generation can vary from one day to the next, it is ideal for outage scheduling to be informed by the weather, with resulting generation that will or could occur on each day being considered for an outage. In this work, we demonstrate how forecasts made with open-source data and tools can improve maintenance outage scheduling relative to not using forecasts, reducing losses relative to perfect scheduling by more than half. Reference code to replicate this work, which is freely available, is also introduced.</description></item><item><title>A 15-bit ROIC With Current-Mode Folding Integration Technique for Microbolometer Thermal Imagers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11223065</link><description>This article presents a 52-mK noise-equivalent temperature difference (NETD) reference-cell-free wide temperature sensing range readout integrated circuit (ROIC) for a microbolometer thermal imager. The proposed ROIC utilizes a 15-bit hybrid analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that employs the current-mode folding integration (CMFI) technique for the coarse conversion and single-slope (SS) operation for the fine conversion.

The design is facilitated by a passive pole-optimized second-order noise-shaping successive-approximation register (NS SAR) quantizer. A sampling&#8211;settling-merged technique is proposed with the assistance of a canceling conductance output stage, leading to significantly suppressed sampling errors and an extension of the available time budget for the NS SAR quantizer. The technique merges the NS SAR quantizer&#8217;s sampling phase with the settling phase of the integration of the continuous-time (CT) feedback digital-to-analog converter (DAC), achieving a power-efficient integration and sampling process. This approach relaxes the operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) requirements in the CT loop and enhances both the resolution and power efficiency of the DSM. The NS SAR quantizer, featuring left-half-circle (LHC) poles, enables complex conjugate poles optimization for the noise transfer function, enabling an excess loop delay compensation (ELDC)-free design. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the prototype analog-to-digital converter achieves a 71.6-dB signal-to-noise and distortion ratio within the 5-MHz bandwidth at an oversampling ratio of 20.

Although triple-well on-chip solar cells improve photovoltaic conversion efficiency, their multiport output characteristics pose design challenges: conventional parallel output schemes cannot address the mismatch in maximum power point (MPP) voltages among ports, thereby limiting energy extraction efficiency. Moreover, fully integrated EH systems lack external storage, and input&#8211;output coupling renders traditional voltage regulation unsuitable. To address these challenges, this article presents a fully integrated dual-channel EH system that employs a dual-port, independently boosted parallel architecture combined with a frequency-driven lightweight self-regulation mechanism, eliminating the need for conventional regulators. Measurement results show that the system achieves a stable output voltage of approximately 1.22 V, a peak end-to-end efficiency of 63.97%, and a 6.31% improvement in maximum output power, while also exhibiting reliable start-up and ripple suppression, providing valuable guidance for the design of efficient power extraction and self-regulation in on-chip photovoltaic EH systems.</description></item><item><title>AHCO-YOLO: An Algorithm&#8211;Hardware Co-Optimization Framework for Energy-Efficient and Real-Time Object Detection on Edge Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11218222</link><description>Real-time object detection on edge devices operates under tight computational, memory, and power budgets. Prior work typically treats model compression and hardware acceleration independently, yielding suboptimal trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and energy. We present AHCO-YOLO, an algorithm&#8211;hardware co-optimization framework (AHCO) that unifies model design, quantization, design space exploration (DSE), and hardware implementation. This approach overcomes the limitations of isolated methods and delivers synergistic gains. We introduce a hardware-friendly, lightweight You Only Look Once (YOLO) model with batch normalization (BN)-preserving quantization method that reduces the model size while maintaining accuracy at low precision. In addition, we propose a layer-specific resource&#8211;latency-aware DSE (LSRLA-DSE) method that selects the optimal dataflow based on layer-wise features and searches hardware design parameters under latency and resource constraints. Furthermore, we propose a FIFO-based streaming architecture with layer-wise dynamic dataflows that maintains high processing element (PE) utilization while minimizing off-chip traffic. Moreover, we introduce a semantic partition and regrouping strategy (SPRG) that improves resource efficiency and throughput. Implemented on a Xilinx ZCU104 FPGA, AHCO-YOLO-T achieves 79.8 FPS at 64.8% mAP, delivering 41.9 FPS/W and 80.5 GOPS/W.

However, accelerating DRL on hardware platforms faces three major challenges: 1) large memory footprint of experience replay data; 2) inefficient weight access due to weight transposition; and 3) computational imbalance across processing elements during deep neural network (DNN) inference and training. To address these issues, we propose E2CAP, an energy-efficient field-programmable gate array (FPGA) accelerator tailored for DRL workloads. E2CAP integrates a compression strategy that significantly reduces the data volume of the experience pool in the DRL model, enabling on-chip deployment of the experience pool. In addition, E2CAP features a configurable array processing core (CAP) based on configurable processing elements (CPEs) that support both intra-PE and inter-PE configurability. This design effectively addresses the issues of weight trans position and computational imbalance, improving computational efficiency and hardware resources utilization. We implement full on-chip DRL inference and training using the DQN algorithm on E2CAP. Experimental results demonstrate a 98.19% compression ratio for experience replay data. Compared to the state-of-the-art CPU and GPU, E2CAP achieves  $33.01\times $  and  $17.72\times $  higher energy efficiency, respectively, while outperforming existing FPGA-based DRL accelerators in multidimensional performance.</description></item><item><title>SConvNSys: Accelerating Spiking Convolutional Neural Networks With a Reconfigurable Neuromorphic Architecture for Diverse Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11247941</link><description>In recent years, spiking neural networks (SNNs) have progressively closed the performance gap with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are renowned for their success in complex artificial intelligence tasks. However, most existing SNN accelerators suffer from limited flexibility, lacking support for diverse convolutional topologies and struggling to deploy complex SNN models. To address these challenges, this article proposes a reconfigurable neuromorphic architecture, SConvNSys, tailored for accelerating spiking CNNs (SCNNs) across a wide range of applications. A fast, sparse detection technique, coupled with a dedicated sparse response unit, is introduced to effectively exploit the spatio-temporal sparsity inherent in spike-based computation. On this basis, a reconfigurable spiking convolution dataflow is designed to optimize computation across various SCNN structures. The proposed architecture supports multiple convolution types, including standard, transposed, dilated, and residual convolutions. Implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), SConvNSys achieves competitive results: for image classification, it attains recognition accuracies of 91.48% on CIFAR-10 and 68.54% on CIFAR-100, with a power consumption of just 1.8 W and a processing rate of 73 frames/s. In image segmentation tasks, it reaches 99.00% segmentation accuracy at 153 frames/s. For object detection, the proposed detection model achieves a mean intersection over union (MIoU) of 74.20%, with 0.11 giga operations (GOP) of convolutional computation, resulting in a throughput of 27.4 giga operations per second (GOPS) and an energy efficiency of 15.23 GOPS/W.</description></item><item><title>Weightless Neural Networks on Flexible Substrates: A Novel Approach to Wearable Machine Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11267783</link><description>In this article, we present a novel approach that seamlessly integrates machine learning (ML) algorithms into wearable technology through the use of weightless neural networks (WNNs) and flexible integrated circuits (FlexICs).

HBM is typically integrated with other systems-on-chip (SoCs) through a silicon interposer, and the primary bottleneck in aggressively scaling the bandwidth in next-generation HBM systems stems from significant crosstalk caused by closely spaced, high-density parallel interconnects in the interposer. While crosstalk avoidance code (CAC) has emerged as a promising solution, prior CAC schemes suffer from low bit efficiency and considerable hardware overhead. This article proposes an efficient CAC scheme, WITCH, which employs a novel weighted coding strategy. Unlike prior approaches that consider all channels identically, WITCH assigns different weights to channels based on their relative positions in the array, enabling more bit-efficient crosstalk suppression. We also present WITCH with additional shielding (WITCH-AS), an extension of WITCH that incorporates additional shielding to further reduce crosstalk levels. Our coding schemes achieve high bit efficiency, up to 17.3% higher than state-of-the-art techniques while providing an identical level of crosstalk reduction. Simulation results using an industry-proven channel model demonstrate that WITCH and WITCH-AS improve eye height by 10.1%&#8211;49.4% and 17.1%&#8211;51.1%, respectively. Furthermore, we propose an area- and energy-efficient hardware implementation that can be integrated into real-world HBM systems. The design reduces area and critical path delay by 31.0% and 28.2%, respectively, compared with conventional designs. Finally, we propose a compatible simultaneous switching output (SSO) noise mitigation technique that can be seamlessly integrated into WITCH to further enhance signal integrity under high-speed, high-density operating conditions.</description></item><item><title>A Heterogeneous CIM Architecture With Splittable Nonvolatile Computing-in-SRAM Cell Pairs Enabling Efficient On-Chip Neural Network Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11239474</link><description>Heterogeneous computing-in-memory (CIM) offers a promising solution for efficient neural network (NN) accelerations by leveraging the characteristics of different types of memories. However, the previous heterogeneous CIM either requires additional data transfer between different types of isolated memories or solely relies on in situ embedded single-level (SL) or three-level (TL) nonvolatile memories (NVMs), making it difficult to trade off between storage density and robustness benefits. In this article, a new heterogeneous CIM architecture (NVS-SPT) with enhanced storage density and inference robustness is proposed to enable full on-chip acceleration of practical-scale NNs while scalable to larger models. A splittable nonvolatile computing-in-static random access memory (SRAM) cell pairs (nvS2RAM-CIM) is proposed with hybrid in situ embedded SL and TL resistive random access memory (ReRAM) groups, allowing flexible configuration as split or linked state to enhance storage density and restore yield. A layerwise hybrid-coding search (LHCS) algorithm with bitwise and tritwise data-aware mapping (BTM) method is proposed to determine the optimal weight coding patterns with high array utilizations. In addition, a merged hybrid-coding block (MHCB) generation scheme is employed to enable high computing parallelism by merging the dense computing patterns. The proposed NVS-SPT demonstrates up to  $4.2\times $  higher storage density compared with previous heterogeneous CIM with pure SL-ReRAMs and achieves up to 44.7% enhanced NN accuracy, compared with previous unified ternary coding. Furthermore, the proposed NVS-SPT exhibits up to  $1.72\times $  and  $1.44\times $  enhanced energy efficiency with  $3.10\times $  and  $1.42\times $  higher computing density, compared with previous heterogeneous CIM based on pure SL- or TL-ReRAMs, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Power Speech-Based Depression Recognition Processor With Hierarchical Local&#8211;Global Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224022</link><description>Depression is a critical public health concern characterized by underdiagnosis, often due to stigma, lack of awareness, and reluctance to seek help. Cases of delayed intervention could be alleviated by wearable solutions which enable continuous and unobtrusive monitoring of depression indicators. Compared to electroencephalogram (EEG)-based and video-based depression recognition, speech-based approaches can be performed without deliberate user attention. However, due to the limited accuracy of existing algorithms and constrained resources at edge, performing accurate speech-based depression recognition on wearable platforms remains a challenge. Therefore, to achieve unobtrusive, accurate, and efficient depression recognition at edge, this work presents a hierarchical local&#8211;global network (HLG-Net) and optimized processor design for speech-based depression recognition. The proposed HLG-Net integrates convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with multihead attention (MHA) mechanism to simultaneously capture local acoustic features and global utterance-level coherence, enhancing depression stage recognition. For efficient processor design, a cross-layer buffered dataflow is proposed for efficient data handling, reducing data storage by 98.77%. The computing unit (CU) employs layer fusion, operator optimization, and quantization techniques to further improve resource utilization and reduce power consumption while preserving recognition accuracy. System-level low-power techniques such as clock/input gating and near-threshold design for application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) further reduce power consumption. The proposed processor implemented on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) (XC7Z100-2FFG900) achieves the lowest reported mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.13 on AVEC 2014 database. The 180-nm ASIC implementation shows a simulated power consumption of  $17.4~\mu $ W at 0.4 V. The results demonstrate the feasibility of accurate and efficient speech-based depression recognition on wearables.</description></item><item><title>Continuous Matrix Transposition for a Subclass of Matrices Using Minimal Memory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11239467</link><description>Transposing matrices is essential in various fields, including signal processing and machine learning, making efficient hardware implementations for real-time processing highly desirable. The transposition of general matrices in a stream using memory is mathematically formalized. A novel algorithm has been developed to compute the necessary sequence of addresses for the memory whose depth is parametrizable and reducible to its theoretical minimum. For the subclass of matrices, where one dimension is a power of two and the other is two, it has been determined that the recursions in this algorithm exhibit logarithmic time complexity when minimal memory is used. Subsequently, it is shown how efficient transposition circuits can be built for these matrices, achieving minimal latency and full throughput. The proposed solution and recently published designs have been simulated for an ASIC implementation using the 45-nm NanGate Open Cell Library and compared for all suitable matrix dimensions of up to  $2\times 512$ . For the considered configurations, the results indicate for the proposed approach a memory saving of up to 33.3% over the state of the art. Overall area savings of up to 24.9% were achieved, making the new scheme very favorable for deployments with restricted area. Further advantages are seen with an average frequency increase of 13.7% and a lowered power consumption by up to 29.6%.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Efficient Kalman Filter Coprocessor Design for Multiple-Object Tracking Targeting at Video Understanding</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11239472</link><description>Energy-efficient Kalman filter (KF) designs are inevitable in multiple-object tracking (MOT), a challenging computer vision task, for real-time mobile applications such as smart glasses, nanodrones, and mobile robots. VLSI design for KF is a feasible way to implement the required complex matrix operations; however, direct implementations are inefficient due to the data sparsity and redundant calculations existing inside. This article introduces an energy-efficient KF coprocessor, which improves computational efficiency by employing KF formula simplifications, matrix sparsity and symmetric properties, and common coefficient sharing, along with a dedicated but flexible hardware architecture. In contrast to state-of-the-art (SOTA) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs that rigidly customize several hardware modules for specific formulations in KF, our architecture executes all formulations in one hardware, enabling both flexibility and high efficiency. Implementation results demonstrate up to  $44.8\times $  improvement in energy efficiency over SOTA solutions, achieving 110.2 GOPs/J when executed at 180 MHz, which supports 120-FPS real-time multiobject tracking.</description></item><item><title>EVMx: An FPGA-Based Accelerator for Smart Contract Processing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11230572</link><description>Ethereum leverages smart contracts (SCs) to power decentralized applications (dApps), with execution handled by the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) within an Ethereum client. Other blockchain platforms, including Avalanche, Polkadot, Aurora, and Cardano, have also adopted the EVM.

Furthermore, EVMx executes entire Ethereum blocks with a percentage reduction in execution time between 6% and 56% against comparable FPGA implementations and 98% to 99% compared to CPU-based EVMs in the literature. These results demonstrate the potential of EVMx to significantly accelerate SC execution and enhance the performance of EVM-compatible blockchains.</description></item><item><title>A 95.3% 12-Class, 108-nJ/Inference Keyword Spotting Chip With Hybrid FFT-BFNet Architecture and Exponent-Aware Nonuniform Quantization in 65-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11259055</link><description>This article presents a 65-nm keyword spotting (KWS) chip that achieves 95.3% accuracy on 12-class tasks with 108.04-nJ/inference efficiency through cross-domain hardware-algorithm innovations. The unified fast Fourier transform (FFT)-butterfly-structured neural network (BFNet) accelerator fundamentally rethinks computational reuse: by replacing dense pointwise convolutions with butterfly-based sparse operations mirroring FFT&#8217;s dataflow, it slashes  $6.3\times $  multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations and halves parameter counts while preserving model expressivity. A 6-bit exponent-aware nonuniform quantization (EANUQ) scheme compresses weights, achieving a 25% reduction in storage while maintaining an accuracy loss of less than 0.01% with lightweight on-chip decoders. Hardware resource sharing extends beyond computation: Mel-filter-banks reuse fully-connected (FC) layer multipliers through decomposed 8-bit arithmetic, and FFT output buffers double as convolutional neural network (CNN) feature map memory.

Our design is the first pipelined CTC Viterbi decoder architecture tailored for nanopore sequencing and is implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-7 (VC707) FPGA within a Linux-capable reduced instruction set computer-fifth generation (RISC-V) system-on-chip (SoC). The accelerator processes over 23&#8198;000 DNA bases per second at 100 MHz with about  $4.3~\boldsymbol {\mu }$ s per-sample latency and only 0.43-W overhead power. This corresponds to  $\textbf {5.3}\times \mathbf {10^{4}}$  bases/J ( $19~\boldsymbol {\mu }$ J/base) and yields approximately 7x end-to-end speedup over a CPU baseline, while reserving the baseline read-identity accuracy. For the same CTC task, the accelerator delivers 29x higher throughput than a recent FPGA beam-search decoder. These results demonstrate the viability of dedicated decoding accelerators for real time, on-device genomic processing in power-constrained environments.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Efficient Edge Coprocessor for Neural Rendering With Explicit Data Reuse Strategies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11301889</link><description>Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have transformed 3-D reconstruction and rendering, facilitating photorealistic image synthesis from sparse viewpoints. This work introduces an explicit data reuse neural rendering (EDR-NR) architecture, which reduces frequent external memory accesses (EMAs) and cache misses by exploiting the spatial locality from three phases, including rays, ray packets (RPs), and samples. The EDR-NR architecture features a four-stage scheduler that clusters rays on the basis of  $Z$ -order, prioritize lagging rays when ray divergence happens, reorders RPs based on spatial proximity, and issues samples out-of-orderly (OoO) according to the availability of on-chip feature data.

Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) have emerged as effective hardware security primitives for device identification and attestation. However, integrating PUFs into existing designs is often manual, labor-intensive, and incurs high overhead in area, power, and design time. Moreover, traditional PUFs are typically localized to small regions of a chip, limiting entropy extraction from the full design surface. To address these limitations, we propose ASTRA, an automated framework that integrates PUF-based entropy sources into digital logic circuits in a distributed and timing-aware fashion. ASTRA enhances the conventional logic synthesis flow by inserting memory-in-logic PUFs (MeLPUFs), which are constructed using standard cell elements and offer high entropy. By distributing MeLPUF primitives across the circuit, ASTRA maximizes response randomness while minimizing area and power overhead. It can also reuse existing logic elements and supports multiple MeLPUF templates. ASTRA ensures timing constraints are respected and enables validation of both functional and logic equivalence checking (LEC) between the original and PUF-inserted designs. Experimental results show that ASTRA achieves near-ideal PUF quality metrics, demonstrating its effectiveness and scalability for secure hardware design.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient VLSI Architecture for Hammerstein-Type Spline Adaptive Filters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11218027</link><description>The Hammerstein spline adaptive filter (HSAF) is a class of nonlinear adaptive filters (NAFs), known for its flexible nonlinear modeling and low complexity in applications, such as self-interference cancellation in wireless communications.

The multibit fusion (MF) scheme enhances energy efficiency by fusing low-bit results, which typically require multiple read-out cycles, into a single-cycle read out. However, the relationship between hybrid INT-CIM circuit design and network performance based on the MF scheme has not yet been systematically explored. In addition, we investigate how different MF configurations affect the performance of various neural networks. To address this gap, we first propose a less-significant group quantization (LSGQ) model, which defines and explores the design space of hybrid INT-CIM. Second, we develop a FastFuse-Search (FFS) algorithm, which optimizes configurations for different networks to strike a better balance between model accuracy and energy efficiency. Based on the experimental results, some key considerations on hybrid CIM design are derived. FFS yields a  $1.72\times $  energy-efficiency boost with negligible accuracy loss. Finally, we fabricate a 28-nm hybrid INT-CIM test chip, achieving 59.74 TOPS/W and 0.96 TOPS/mm2, with performance metrics of 23.21 perplexity for GPT-2, 68.69% accuracy for ResNet18, and 80.53% accuracy for ViT.</description></item><item><title>A Crosstalk Suppressed Reconfigurable Fully Passive Multichannel Noise-Shaping SAR ADC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11239512</link><description>This brief presents a reconfigurable multichannel noise-shaping (NS) SAR analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with crosstalk suppression.

While individual analytical models exist for these mismatch sources, designers rely on Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the combined errors. This brief introduces a unified analytical framework with closed-form expressions that capture both mismatch sources, enabling efficient estimation of root mean square (rms) integral nonlinearity/differential nonlinearity (INL/DNL). Validated against circuit simulations, the model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.71% ( $\boldsymbol {\sigma _{\textbf {DNL}}}$ ) and 2.51% ( $\sigma _{\text {INL}}$ ), and the maximum absolute error (MaxE) remains within 5.44%. This predictive capability guides high-yield, precision, power, and area (PPA)-optimized system-on-chip (SoC) design, enabling over  $3{\times }$  silicon area reduction through application-specific optimization.</description></item><item><title>Modern Wireline Transceivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11311714</link><description>Over the past two decades, ever-increasing network bandwidth (BW) demands in data centers and high-performance computing systems have fueled exponential growth in per-lane serial link data rates. To keep up with this demand and enable faster communication over BW-limited electrical channels, wireline transceiver architectures and circuit topologies have rapidly evolved over this timeframe to support sophisticated modulation and equalization. This tutorial paper presents an overview of modern serial links. Application background is described, motivating the link energy efficiency and bit error rate (BER) requirements. Transmit and receive circuits and architectures are described for both short-reach and long-reach electrical interconnects. The former tends to rely on power-efficient analog/mixed-signal techniques to equalize relatively low-loss channels with reach up to a few cm, while the latter requires sophisticated digital signal processing (DSP) along with high-speed ADCs and DACs to compensate channels with loss greater than 30 dB at Nyquist. Optical links are reviewed in the context of intra-data center applications where they are increasingly used. Low-jitter, high-phase-accuracy clock generation and distribution techniques are examined. Finally, future directions for modulation, equalization, and error correction to support links exceeding 200 Gb/s are discussed.</description></item><item><title>A 2.16-pJ/b 112-Gb/s PAM-4 Transceiver With Time-Interleaved 2-b/3-b ADCs and Unbalanced Baud-Rate CDR for XSR Applications in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981549</link><description>This article presents a 112-Gb/s four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) transceiver (TRX) for extra-short-reach (XSR) applications in 28-nm CMOS. The receiver (RX) adopts a  $4\times 6$  time-interleaving structure with 2-bit and 3-bit sub-analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for decoding the PAM-4 signal, eliminating the need for high-speed samplers and saving significant power. The proposed unbalanced baud-rate phase detector (PD) increases the clock and data recovery (CDR) tracking bandwidth without degrading high-frequency (HF) jitter performance. The transmitter (TX) adopts an unsegmented voltage-mode driver with three-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE). The output impedance control loops maintain the output impedance as different FFE coefficients are applied. This architecture provides high FFE resolution while consuming relatively low power.

The proposed receiver utilizes an integrator that integrates analog front-end outputs for two unit intervals (UIs) from the edge of data. The 2UI integration enables the implementation of the pattern-based baud-rate CDR and DFE adaptation algorithm without relying on a data-level reference (dLev). Therefore, the proposed receiver only uses zero-crossing samplers, saving power consumption and chip area. Moreover, the proposed baud-rate CDR is less sensitive to the channel conditions compared to the conventional baud-rate CDR using the Mueller and M&#252;ller phase detector (MMPD). A prototype receiver fabricated in 40-nm CMOS technology is tested with three channels to demonstrate the performance of the CDR and DFE adaptation. As a result, the receiver achieves a bit error rate (BER) less than  $10{^{-12}}$  at 32 Gb/s under 16-dB channel loss. Without the need for the dLev, the proposed receiver occupies an active area of 0.026 mm2 and consumes 38.04 mW, achieving an energy efficiency of 1.19 pJ/b.</description></item><item><title>A 20-Gb/s/Line Single-Ended Transceiver With Coupling-Balanced Crosstalk-Cancellation for Shield-Less 1.5-&#956;m-Pitch Interconnect</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11015243</link><description>This article presents a 20-Gb/s/line current-mode (CM) transceiver for dense short-reach on-chip interconnect.

A complex-zero continuous-time linear equalizer (CZ-CTLE) is proposed to effectively equalize the complex-pole response of the VCSEL, improving in-band gain/group delay (GD) flatness and extending bandwidth (BW). To enhance link energy efficiency and jitter margin, resonant clocking techniques are proposed, including a transmission-line-based resonant global clock distribution and a wide-tuning-range coupled-resonator-based quadrature generation. A low-power electrical TX architecture employing an NMOS-over-NMOS (N/N) voltage-mode driver with eye symmetry correction is introduced to further improve the energy efficiency and link margin. The optical TX prototype, implemented in a 22-nm FinFET process, achieves an aggregate non-return-to-zero (NRZ) data rate of 256 Gb/s with an energy efficiency of 1.3 pJ/b. This work outperforms previous optical TXs by  $\gt 2.2\times $  in optical modulation amplitude, achieving  $1.4\times $  ( $7.6\times $ ) greater eye width (EW) [eye height (EH)], with 14% higher per-channel baud rate and 11% better energy efficiency. The direct-drive optical driver achieves 80-Gb/s NRZ operation, demonstrating a 13% higher data rate and  $25\times $  better energy efficiency than prior art.

The CSS mechanism presets the input capacitors of a successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to  $V_{\text {DD}}$  and subsequently discharges them during a reference-triggered pulse through a pseudo-differential MOS pair directly driven by the oscillator. The resulting differential-mode (DM) charge residue, proportional to the time error, is digitized by the ADC to support all-digital PLL (ADPLL) operation. The proposed technique simultaneously achieves high-TD gain for low jitter, the excellent oscillator isolation for reduced reference spur, and multi-bit digital TD output for fast locking, fully leveraging the capabilities of advanced CMOS technology. A digital loop filter (DLF) featuring a dead zone (DZ) in the integral path is introduced to mitigate potential conflicts with the proportional path. To accommodate the short-oscillator period  $T_{\text {osc}}$  at millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequencies, we propose extending the CSS pulsewidth to  $1.5\,T_{\text {osc}}$ . In addition, a damped-sine waveform model for the CSS current is developed, providing deeper insights into the high-TD gain characteristics. The comprehensive noise analysis of the CSS is conducted using a multirate timestamp model, identifying contributions to the output phase noise (PN). Fabricated in 22-nm CMOS, the 18.8&#8211;23.3-GHz CSS-ADPLL prototype achieves 63-fs rms jitter, &#8722;52.4-dBc reference spur, and a figure of merit (FoM) of &#8722;254 dB, while consuming 9.95-mW total power, with only 1.3 mW allocated to the loop. For an initial frequency error of 200 MHz, the system achieves a locking time of  $0.61~{\mu }$ s, benefiting from the combined effects of a counter-based frequency-locked loop (FLL) ( $0.27~{\mu }$ s) and the multi-bit digital output of the CSS-ADPLL ( $0.34~{\mu }$ s).</description></item><item><title>A D-Band Distributed MIMO FMCW Radar CMOS Transceiver</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11049937</link><description>This work introduces a D-band 4TX/4RX distributed multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar CMOS transceiver with real-time reference-clock synchronization for multistatic imaging system.

Dedicated to the SATCOM planar phased array systems, the design of the K-/Ka-band down/up frequency converter (FC) chipsets is detailed in this article. The quadrature Gilbert FCs benefit from the proposed differentiated IF and LO high-order in-phase and quadrature (IQ) balancing techniques, supporting fully on-chip high-image/sideband rejection ratio (IRR/SRR). The wideband IF signal processing chains, simultaneously enabling gain control, reconfigurable filtering, Hilbert transformation, voltage/power amplifying, as well as single-ended/differential signal conversions, are proposed for the heterodyne up and down FCs, contributing to versatile and ready-to-use IF interfaces for various SATCOM modems in L and S bands. Power amplifying and buffering stages accompanied by gain control blocks are integrated to enhance the driving capability and dynamic range. In addition, the harmonic rejection quadrupler chain is adopted to relieve the high-frequency low-noise requirements on external LO sources and allow low-loss on-board routes. Fabricated in 65-nm CMOS technology and packaged with the wafer-level chip-scale packaging (WLCSP), the FC chipsets fully support the 2-D operation in the RF band of 17.7&#8211;21.2 GHz [downlink receiver (RX)]/27.5&#8211;31.0 GHz [uplink transmitter (TX)] and the wide-IF band of 0.8&#8211;4 GHz, offering the peak conversion gain of 35.7/33 dB for the RX/TX, with over 40-dBc IRR/SRR and 58-dBc calibrated LO suppression.</description></item><item><title>A Millimeter-Wave Power Amplifier With an Integrated CMOS Isolator/Circulator/Receiver</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11018353</link><description>This article presents a reconfigurable millimeter-wave (mm-wave) fully integrated transceiver (TRX) front end that comprises a power amplifier (PA) and an integrated nonreciprocal ultra-compact isolator/circulator/receiver (RX). The circulator is based on a ring quarter-wave transmission line (QTL) topology with adjusted characteristic impedances, which improves transmitter (TX)-to-antenna insertion loss and TX-to-RX isolation. The circulator&#8217;s nonreciprocal gyrator features an and-gate switching-based N-path filter while also acting as a mixer-first RX. By activating the embedded cross-coupled negative resistors, the circulator can be reconfigured as an isolator. This compact N-path filter-based circulator/isolator occupies only 0.38 mm2. Over a 27.1&#8211;31.1-GHz band, the realized front end offers &gt;20-dB TX-to-RX isolation, with a measured TX-to-antenna insertion loss of  $1.7{\sim }2.2$  dB. The RX path tolerates the PA&#8217;s blocker signal, achieving 5-dBm in-band and 13-dBm out-of-band (OOB)  $B_{\text {1dB}}$ . The PA delivers 15.15-dBm peak output power with 33% drain efficiency. The functionality of the proposed frequency division duplex (FDD) front end is evaluated by simultaneous TX/RX operation with a 400-MHz TX/RX modulation bandwidth and 400-MHz channel spacing. The measured AM&#8211;PM of the realized PA with the integrated isolator shows relatively high voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) resilience at the lower power level and less robustness against VSWR around its peak output power. The front-end prototype occupies only 0.7 mm2, including circulator, PA, quadrature hybrid coupler LO generators, and baseband circuits.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Band 5.3&#8211;18 GHz LNA for FR3 Bands Using Hybrid Switching With Sub-2 dB NF in FDSOI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008556</link><description>This article presents a multi-band 5.3&#8211;18-GHz low-noise amplifier (LNA) for 6G applications in GlobalFoundries 22FDX technology.

To facilitate fast frequency modulation while reducing phase noise, a digital-to-time converter (DTC)-based sub-sampling phase-locked loop (SSPLL) with two-point modulation (TPM) technique is leveraged. Integrated with a ramp integrator, the proposed second-order curve-fitting (2nd-CF) digital predistortion (DPD) technique could remarkably mitigate the nonlinearities in the frequency modulation path while significantly reducing the hardware complexity. Meanwhile, a ramp tracker is parallelly utilized to initialize the lookup table (LUT) of DPD for a robust chirp linearity calibration. To reduce the idle time of the ultra-fast chirp without affecting its linearity, a modified DTC modulator is designed to achieve zero phase error at large frequency hopping moments. Furthermore, to achieve robust background calibrations in SSPLL, a voltage tracking loop (VTL) with a hold function is proposed to extract the phase-error sign and cooperate with the LUT to ensure an orderly convergence of the DPD. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the FMCW chirp generator occupies a core area of 1.2 mm2 and consumes 50.8 mW. The measured maximum chirp bandwidth is 2.4 GHz, corresponding to 21.4% of the center frequency. A maximum chirp slope of 2.3 GHz/ $\mu $ s is achieved with 2.3-GHz chirp bandwidth, 1- $\mu $ s chirp duration, and 50-ns idle time, and the largest measured rms frequency error is 1198 kHz for sawtooth and triangular chirps, corresponding to 0.052% of the chirp bandwidth.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Voltage-Time Domain Pipelined ADC With Reference-Embedded Time-Domain Residues</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048902</link><description>This article presents a hybrid voltage-time domain pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The proposed ADC employs a voltage-domain SAR quantizer for the coarse stage, while a time-domain quantizer is used for the fine stage. A hybrid-domain dual-residue method is proposed to generate reference-embedded time-domain residues. It ensures full-scale matching between the converted time-domain residue and the time-domain reference of the fine stage. For the fine stage sub-quantizer, an interpolating time-to-digital converter (TDC) suited for dual-residue quantization is employed without using an external time-domain reference. A prototype ADC, implemented in a 40-nm CMOS process, occupies 0.034 mm2. Operating at a sampling rate of 150 MS/s, the ADC achieves an SNDR of 61.1 dB and an SFDR of 75.5 dB at a Nyquist input, while consuming 2.54 mW, resulting in a Walden figure-of-merit (FoMW) of 18.3 fJ/conv.-step.</description></item><item><title>An Easy-Driving Incremental Zoom ADC With Skipped Sampling Scheme and NS-SAR Quantizer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11039217</link><description>This article presents an incremental zoom analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Unlike prior zoom ADC designs, a floating inverter amplifier (FIA)-assisted residue extraction scheme is proposed to maintain the residue voltage during loop filtering. It allows the ADC to skip repeated sampling operations between consecutive fine conversions, thus largely reducing the sampling time and driving cost. To speed up the conversion, a high-efficiency second-order single buffer embedded noise-shaping (NS) successive approximation register (SAR) is proposed as the fine quantizer, allowing a low conversion cycle of 32.

To address this need, this article presents an IC with 32 high dynamic range (HDR) electrocorticography (ECoG) recording channels and two programmable neurostimulators allowing bi-directional neural interfacing. The recording channel uses a 2nd-order continuous-time  $\Delta \Sigma $  modulator (CTDSM) architecture with 12-tap finite impulse response digital-to-analog converter (FIRDAC) feedback facilitated by a pre-emptive current-steering excess loop delay (ELD) compensation scheme. By employing a high-performance linearized low-noise/low-power transconductance amplifier (L3TA) in the input integration stage, the recording channel achieves 83-dB dynamic range (DR) with up to 222-mVpp linear input range, and thus can accommodate large electrode dc offsets (EDOs) and stimulation artifacts. Thanks to the FIRDAC that relaxes component matching requirements, each recording channel occupies only 0.028 mm2 and consumes  $5.39~{\mu }$ W while being manufactured in standard 180-nm CMOS technology. The concurrent neural recording and stimulation capabilities of the chip have been validated in a mouse experiment in vivo, which shows that the recording channel can tolerate real stimulation artifacts and the recorded ECoG signals can be separated from the artifacts with high fidelity.</description></item><item><title>A Highly Power-Efficient Input-Boosted First Stage for Capacitively Coupled Chopper Instrumentation Amplifiers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988836</link><description>This article presents a highly power-efficient capacitively coupled chopper instrumentation amplifier (CCIA) featuring an input-boosted first stage and leakage compensation circuits. To address the limitations of low-noise front-end amplifier design imposed by the physical constraints of  $g_{\mathrm {m}}/I_{\mathrm {d}}$ , we proposed an input-boosted, inverter-based operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) scheme. This approach introduces a new perspective by doubling the signal-dependent voltage, effectively halving the input-referred noise (IRN) with the same supply current and voltage. Two prototypes were implemented in 180 and 22 nm CMOS processes, consuming 24 and 1.6 nW, respectively. To mitigate leakage current issues in the ultralow-power 22 nm prototype, compensation circuits are incorporated to address reverse-biased diode leakage and bulk leakage current. The 180 nm prototype achieves an IRN of  $5.09~{\mathrm {\mu V_{\rm rms}}}$  within a 1.6 kHz bandwidth (BW), yielding a power efficiency factor (PEF) of 0.58. The 22 nm prototype achieves an IRN of  $8.05~{\mathrm {\mu V_{\rm rms}}}$  within a 230 Hz BW, resulting in a PEF of 0.69. Measurements under varying temperatures validate the effectiveness of the leakage compensation circuits. The proposed input-boosted CCIA achieves the highest PEF among continuous-time amplifiers (CTAs), offering a general solution for power-efficient amplifier design.</description></item><item><title>A Capacitive Touch-Sensing Chip With NTF-Alignment Excitation Source and Direct Lock-In ADC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029238</link><description>Capacitive touch-screen systems have been widely used in tablets, smartphones, smartwatches, etc. Various sources of noise, such as display and charger noise, limit the energy efficiency of capacitive touch sensors. Traditional noise-reduction methods such as lock-in sensing architecture lead to significant power consumption that shortens the lifetime of battery-powered devices. To address the issue, we propose a noise transfer function (NTF)-alignment technique, in which the excitation signals are precisely placed at the zeros of NTF and the touch-screen system noise lies between them. In addition, a subsequent direct lock-in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with bandpass noise shaping utilizes the same NTF zeros as the excitation source, resulting in a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) throughout the entire signal chain. This simple structure also eliminates bandpass filters, mixers, and low-pass filters in conventional lock-in sensing chains. The proposed techniques are implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process, demonstrating a touch-screen prototype embedded with a 28-channel chip occupying an area of 1.31 mm2. The measured results show that the chip achieves an SNR of 58.9 (for 10-mm  $\Phi $ ) and 41.3 dB (for 1-mm  $\Phi $  stylus), with only 1.054-mW power dissipated at 120 frames/s.

The DIUC limits the voltage stress on all switches to an input voltage (VIN) level, eliminating the need for high-voltage (HV) transistors like LDMOS. Unlike previous step-up converters where the inductor current (IL) rapidly increases as a duty (D) rises, the DIUC maintains IL equal to the load current regardless of D. This feature mitigates the conduction loss due to the inductor parasitic dc resistance (DCR) and right-half-plane (RHP) zero effect, improving both power efficiency and frequency response. When changing the operation mode according to the conversion ratio (CR), the DIUC achieves a small overshoot of 158 mV and undershoot of 107 mV in the output voltage (VOUT) with the proposed smooth mode transition (SMT) technique. Additionally, a multi-step gate driving method with two precharging techniques reduces the required bootstrap capacitance by 46.3% to save the silicon area. The 0.18- $\mu $ m prototype chip uses only 5-V CMOS transistors, while all bootstrap capacitors are integrated on the chip. With a 4.7- $\mu $ H inductor (DCR of 98 m $\Omega $ ) and two 10-  $\mu $ F flying capacitors, the DIUC achieves high  ${V} {_{\text {OUT}}}$  up to 13 V, a maximum load current of 1.2 A, and a peak efficiency of 96.5%.</description></item><item><title>A 3&#8211;5 V to Sub-1 V DLDO-SC-Sigma Converter With Auxiliary Loop for Efficiency Improvement in High-Density Power Delivery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002627</link><description>This article presents a switched-capacitor (SC) sigma converter with a digital low dropout (DLDO) regulator and an auxiliary loop for efficiency improvement for high-density power delivery applications.

By combining two sides of converters, this work takes advantage of both high power density and fast response under 5 V to sub-1 V step-down conversion. To further improve overall efficiency, an auxiliary control loop is proposed to guarantee a minimized dropout voltage for the DLDO across a wide range of input and output voltages. The DLDO-SC-Sigma converter was fabricated in a 40 nm CMOS process. It can deliver 5 A maximum current from 3 to 5 V input to sub-1 V output and achieves a peak efficiency of 92%. A  $1.6~{\mu }$ s response time and 36 mV voltage droop are achieved with a 2 A load transient.

Traditional high-voltage inverters with output voltages above 5 V typically require dedicated power converters, such as LDOs or buck converters, to supply power to gate drivers and control circuits, often leading to reduced efficiency and increased system costs. In this work, an efficient supply-generating technique that directly produces a 5-V power supply from an auxiliary coil&#8212;strategically positioned to harness energy from the primary coil&#8212;simplifies the power supply design and eliminates the need for external components. The transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) were fabricated using a 0.18- $\mu $ m BCD process and packaged in a land grid array (LGA) package. Experimental results confirm that the converter achieves a peak efficiency of 73.2% and a power density of 36.5 mW/mm3. Compared to other integrated solutions, the proposed converter realizes a 13.2% efficiency improvement, and its electromagnetic interference (EMI) performance satisfies the CISPR-32 Class B standard on a two-layer PCB without any stitching capacitors.</description></item><item><title>A 48&#8211;5-V Buck Converter With Triple EMI Suppression Circuit for Achieving 41-dB Peak EMI Reduction and Meeting CISPR 25 Automotive Standards</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11036262</link><description>This article presents a triple electromagnetic interference suppression circuit (TESC) designed to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) value to meet CISPR 25 standards. The energy resonant recycling (ERR) technique is employed to control dv/dt of  $V_{\text {SW}}$  using additional  $L_{\text {r}}$  and capacitors ( ${C} {_{1}}$  and  ${C} {_{2}}$ ) to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and zero-current switching (ZCS). Simultaneously, the dv/dt of  $V_{\text {SW}}$  is adjusted by the limiting pre-charge current  $I_{L\text {r}}$  to lessen  $V_{\text {SW}}$  ringing, thereby contributing to EMI suppression. Moreover, ERR recycles the ringing energy at  $V_{\text {SW}}$  back to the input switched-capacitor (SC) network during light-load condition. The line impedance stabilization network-based front-end cancellation (LFC) generates a current  $I_{\text {INJ}}$  through sense  $V_{\text {IN}}$  information to eliminate the current ripple of  ${I} {_{\text {Battery}}}$  from 4.5 to 0.8 mA, thereby preventing interference with other circuits and reducing EMI. The true-random spread-spectrum modulation (TR-SSM) utilizes dual TR-SSM to effectively mitigate harmonic tone. After applying TR-SSM, the EMI amplitude of  $V_{\text {Battery}}$  and  $V_{\text {SW}}$  can be significantly reduced by 20 and 16 dB at  $f_{\text {SW}}$ , respectively. By combining these three techniques, TESC reduces EMI by 33 dB at 2 MHz and 41 dB at 73 MHz.</description></item><item><title>A Cryo-BiCMOS Controller for Quantum Computers based on Trapped Beryllium Ions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11272083</link><description>This article presents a cryo-BiCMOS system on chip (SoC) designed for single and two-qubit gate operations for quantum computers (QCs) based on beryllium trapped-ions (TIs).

However, such techniques face challenges related to design overhead and robustness. This article presents the early-monitoring error prediction (EMEP) technique to address these issues effectively. With minimal clock tree (CT) impact and low area (1.6%) and power overhead (2%), EMEP achieves 60% endpoint coverage. This wide coverage, combined with increased resilience against critical activity masking and variability, enhances system robustness. In addition,  $4\sigma $  yield is ensured through statistical critical path identification. Automatically integrated into a 28-nm CMOS RISC-V microcontroller, EMEP recovers 86% of conventional energy margins and reduces energy consumption by 2.9 pJ/cycle (41%), outperforming traditional replicas by 61% and endpoint monitoring (EPM) techniques by 31%. EMEP operates the microcontroller with only 14.5% energy overhead compared with margin-free operation, which is essential to address activity uncertainty, becoming minimal when the slowest critical paths are active.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Clock Duty-Cycle Controller to Mitigate Aging-Induced Clock Duty-Cycle Distortion in Automotive and IoT Processors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11089959</link><description>An adaptive clock duty-cycle controller (DCC) mitigates the adverse effect of aging-induced clock duty-cycle distortion (DCD) on the minimum supply voltage ( $V_{\text {MIN}}$ ) of high-performance automotive and Internet of Things (IoT) processors. The all-digital DCC measures the DCD from a clock-leaf node with a duty-cycle monitor (DCM). The DCM interfaces with an adaptive control to configure a duty-cycle adjuster (DCA). The DCA adapts the duty cycle at the clock-root node to compensate for the DCD at the clock-leaf nodes. A 3-nm test chip integrates the DCC into the clock path of a high-performance, industry-level neural processing unit (NPU) matrix-multiplication unit (MXU).

The proposed NHAC, featuring a Bitcell-compatible layout, is inserted between cell arrays to supply power by dividing cell-power (CVDD) into sub-arrays without additional dummy cells or white space. NHAC improves write ability even in high  $R_{\text {INT}}$  cases, thanks to the continuous self-collapse of the CVDD voltage by supplying cell power through NMOS during write operations. The NMOS header in NHAC prevents excessive CVDD voltage collapse, thus ensuring the dynamic data retention stability of column half-selected cells (CHSCs). Additionally, by enabling all NHACs in sleep mode, the CVDD voltage can be clamped below the supply voltage, thereby reducing bitcell retention leakage without additional area costs. SRAM macros with additional resistors were fabricated using a 14 nm FinFET process to measure the impact of  $R_{\text {INT}}$  on the write assist circuits. NHAC achieves a  $V_{\text {MIN}}$  improvement of 210 mV with 4% power overhead, even in the high  $R_{\text {INT}}$  case. In sleep mode, NHAC reduces bitcell retention leakage by 25% at 0.65 V and up to 61% at 1 V. NHAC demonstrates improved write  $V_{\text {MIN}}$  similar to transient voltage collapse (TVC) write assist. Additionally, it achieves low-power overhead similar to self-induced voltage collapse (SIC) write assist.</description></item><item><title>A 22-nm 109.3-to-249.5-TFLOPS/W Outlier-Aware Floating-Point SRAM Compute-in-Memory Macro for Large Language Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016687</link><description>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in complex artificial intelligence (AI) tasks. However, their rapidly increasing parameter sizes lead to significant communication and computational overhead, posing challenges to the energy efficiency (EEF) and memory footprint of AI processors. Compute-in-memory (CIM) architecture has emerged as a promising solution to alleviate bandwidth constraints and improve EEF. Nonetheless, both integer (INT) and floating-point (FP) CIM implementations struggle with the trade-off between accuracy and memory requirement when applied to LLMs. Outlier-aware quantization (OAQ), which employs low-precision formats for normal values and retains FP formats for high-magnitude outliers, has proven effective in matching the accuracy of full-FP baselines and has become a mainstream approach for efficient LLM deployment. Therefore, this work presents OA-CIM, an SRAM-based digital CIM macro that facilitates element-wise hybrid processing of BF16 outliers and INT4 normal values. The major contributions are: 1) an LUT-based multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) circuit design, which supports efficient FP/INT-compatible (FIC) MAC operations; 2) an xor-sharing non-maximum exponent gating scheme that reduces latency and area by bypassing unnecessary exponent comparisons in FP dataflow; and 3) a sparsity-aware readout circuit with distribution-offset weight encoding (DOWE) to mitigate the power-intensive charging/discharging process on the bitline. A 22-nm 512-kB 8T SRAM OA-CIM prototype is fabricated, which achieves an EEF of 346.6 TOPS/W in INT4 mode and 249.5 TFLOPS/W in outlier mode, representing a  $2.7{\times }$  to  $3.1{\times }$  improvement over state-of-the-art mixed-precision CIMs.</description></item><item><title>Cache-PIM: An ECC-Compatible eDRAM Processing-in-Memory for Last-Level Cache With Triple-Level Error Correction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11007279</link><description>This article presents cache-processing-in-memory (PIM), an error correction code (ECC)-compatible embedded dynamic random access memory (eDRAM) PIM-based last-level cache (LLC) with a novel triple-level error correction. Integrating PIM into the cache system causes the existing ECC to become a performance bottleneck, leading to higher latency and decreased computational accuracy. An ECC-compatible eDRAM-PIM enables reliable in-memory computing (IMC) even in less stable DRAM environments while reducing ECC latency for PIM tasks. Cache-PIM proposes three key features: 1) triggered error correction with concurrent error detection (TECCED) reduces cell error correction latency for PIM tasks; 2) adaptive error canceling (AEC) corrects computation errors; and 3) resolution-aware single-cycle voting (RSV) reduces analog-to-digital converter (ADC) readout error. Cache-PIM is fabricated in 28-nm CMOS technology and occupies 0.66-mm2 die area. A demonstration of ViT-Base on the ImageNet dataset achieves 61% latency reduction compared to the conventional ECC and 77.1% accuracy.</description></item><item><title>ETCIM: Error-Tolerant Digital CIM Processor With Redundancy-Free Hard Error Repair and Run-Time Soft Error Correction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11007640</link><description>Digital computing-in-memory (CIM) has demonstrated outstanding energy and area efficiency. Although digital CIM avoids errors along the in-memory computing path, it is indispensable to correct hard and soft errors in digital CIM&#8217;s SRAM cells like conventional SRAM for commercial products. Hard errors come from defects in chip fabrication. Soft errors result from bit flips in an SRAM cell during CIM computation, and cause multiply-accumulation (MAC) errors. However, traditional SRAM&#8217;s error correction scheme cannot be directly applied to digital CIM, which causes hardware overhead in hard error repair, and incompatibility and latency problems in soft error correction. To tackle the above challenges, we propose an error-tolerant digital CIM processor ETCIM with three corresponding features: 1) a fault-adaptive CIM initializer (FACI) and input feeder reduce the hard error repair overhead by up to  $8.47{\times }$  power and  $18.16{\times }$  area savings; 2) a blockwise error correction code (BW-ECC) CIM macro suits the digital CIM structure that integrates multiple weight blocks, and corrects soft MAC errors; and 3) a progressive cell error corrector (PCEC) hides soft cell error correction latency during computation, reducing the total latency by up to 96.8%. The fabricated ETCIM achieves a state-of-the-art energy efficiency with an error correction of 19.5 tera operations per second (TOPS)/W at INT8.</description></item><item><title>FSNAP: An Ultra-Energy-Efficient Reconfigurable Few-Spikes-Neuron-Based SNN Processor Supporting Unified On-Chip Learning and Adaptive Time-Window Tuning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11031188</link><description>Spiking neural network (SNN) processors have attracted significant attention as energy-efficient alternatives to artificial neural network (ANN) processors due to their event-driven and sparse computing properties. However, existing SNN processors primarily rely on leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons, which require large time-windows (TWs) and a substantial number of spikes to achieve high accuracy. This results in excessive energy consumption and high latency. Furthermore, most SNN processors either support spike-based backpropagation (BP) learning or ANN-to-SNN conversion-based learning, limiting their adaptability across diverse applications. Additionally, the use of fixed-size TWs leads to inefficient resource utilization and poor adaptability to dynamic input characteristics. To address these challenges, this work proposes FSNAP, an energy-efficient SNN processor that leverages the recently introduced few-spikes-neuron (FSN) model. Unlike conventional LIF neurons, FSNs utilize an optimized spike encoding and decoding scheme that enables high computational efficiency with significantly fewer spikes and a shorter time window. The proposed processor has the following contributions: 1) a reconfigurable FSN-based SNN inference and learning architecture with time-skipped spike accumulation and parallel spike generation, which achieves low-latency, high-efficiency computation; 2) a unified on-chip learning architecture supporting the proposed low-complexity FSN-hybrid learning, FSN-BP learning, and ANN-to-FSN-SNN conversion based (FSN-conversion) learning, which enhances accuracy and flexibility across various applications; and 3) an accuracy-driven adaptive TW tuning technique that dynamically adjusts TW sizes to optimize energy consumption and latency while maintaining high accuracy. Fabricated in a 55-nm CMOS process, FSNAP achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art SNN designs on six different tasks. On the IMAGE task, it demonstrates  $2.24{\times }$  to  $172.8{\times }$  higher energy efficiency when scaled to the same process node and operating voltage, and  $3.40{\times }$  to  $1616.4{\times }$  speedup when scaled to the same operating frequency, all while maintaining high accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Ferroelectric Digital In-Memory Computing for Scalable, Reliable, and Efficient Similarity Computation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11178075</link><description>Classification-based learning in deep neural networks, particularly few-shot learning, demands efficient similarity metrics such as Hamming distance.

Unlike conventional designs that exclusively consider the differential-mode (DM) coupling factor in 1:2 transformers, our proposed architecture effectively leverages the combined potential of DM and CM coupling factors in a single transformer. For DM operation, a novel design method is presented to efficiently guide the design of ultra-low-power VCOs. This method provides clear insights into how Class-F3 resonator parameters influence the loop gain characteristics, establishing a quantitative framework for performance optimization. Regarding CM operation, the 1:2 transformer&#8217;s coupling mechanism is analyzed in detail for the first time. The analysis reveals that strategic layout optimization of the center tap can reactivate the CM coupling factor, effectively expanding the CM resonance to reduce PN. Furthermore, by incorporating a tightly coupled tertiary coil, a local oscillator signal with high spectral purity is realized. Fabricated in a 110-nm CMOS process, the proposed VCO achieves a 20.2% frequency tuning range (FTR) from 10.45 to 12.80 GHz, consuming 0.38-0.50 mW with 0.2-V power supply.

However, the sensitivity of the MEMS sensor reduces with the sensor size scaling down, leading to deterioration of the circuit noise. To meet this challenge, the interface circuit with high-voltage pulse excitation (HVPE) and active noise cancelation readout technique is proposed. The HVPE reduces the circuit noise and the wire resistance noise significantly without introducing additional electrostatic force to the sensor. The drift and mismatch problems of the HVPE are addressed by three specific correction circuits. The power efficiency of the system is optimized by the capacitance-to-voltage converter with active noise cancellation and pulse current supply. The propose HVPE technique is demonstrated in an interface IC fabricated by  $0.18\mu $  m BCD process and tested with a small size MEMS accelerometer (0.64mm2/axis). The measurement result shows that this IC has achieved a noise floor of  $32.5\mu $ g/ $\surd $  Hz with 2kHz bandwidth and  $80\mu $  W power consumption.</description></item><item><title>A Multibit ReRAM Computing-in-Memory Processor With Adaptive Decision Level Nonlinear ADC for Ultra-Low-Energy Keyword Spotting in Mobile Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11149659</link><description>This paper presents an ultra-low-energy keyword spotting (KWS) processor based on the charge-mode multi-level resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) bitcell and adaptive analog-to-digital converter (ADC) quantization.

Compared to the non-standard designs, the standard (e.g. BLE-compliant) WuRX chips can be integrated seamlessly into the widely-deployed infrastructures, while there are more design challenges since the BLE-compliant WuRX should be resilient to adjacent-channel interferes as well as realize a high sensitivity. In traditional BLE-compliant WuRXs, the interferes were suppressed by an FBAR filter or a low-noise local oscillator (LO) generator, with the penalty of sensitivity degradation or additional power consumption. The existing edge-combine LO generating method can cut down the power consumption, while the increased LO noise significantly degraded the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) performance. In this work, we have demonstrated a BLE-compliant WuRX chip that improves both the SIR and sensitivity with low power dissipation. Instead of the conventional I/Q path with 90 degrees out of the phase, a pseudo-I/Q dual-downconversion structure is proposed to offer a WuRX driven by 120-degree-apart ultra-low-power LOs signals, which helps to improve the SIR performance due to the lower LO noise than the conventional edge-combine methods. In addition, a dummy down-converter based mismatch-cancellation technique is proposed to improve the image rejection ratio (IRR) and sensitivity. Fabricated by a 65nm CMOS process, the proposed BLE-compliant WuRX chip achieves -21dB SIR in the adjacent channel as well as -94dBm sensitivity at the cost of only  $306\mu $ W power.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Design of an 884-MHz Duty-Cycled Ambient RF Energy Harvester IC Capturing 8.7 &#956;J From &#8211;35.2 dBm per 1.6 Hours</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151652</link><description>This paper presents an analysis and design of a duty-cycled ambient RF energy harvester (RFEH) IC effectively harvesting a relatively large amount of energy from a small input RF power. We have newly developed the system model of the duty-cycled ambient RFEH by considering the rectifier current, the power management unit (PMU) current, the capacitor current and the load current. Based on this system model, we have defined the capacitor charging power and analyzed the power conversion efficiency (PCE). From the analysis results, we could find the optimum input RF power maximizing the PCE at a given output DC voltage. By considering this optimum input RF power as well as the PCE, the passive amplification gain and the charging time simultaneously, we have optimized the design parameters of the RF-DC rectifier. For circuit implementation, we have placed the input coupling metal-oxide-metal (MOM) capacitors of the RF-DC rectifier above the P-diffusion area with relatively low parasitic resistance, minimized the power consumption of the PMU and considered the capacitor leakage current to enhance the PCE.

The inputs from the SiPM array are picked up individually and row-column summed to reduce the number of measurement circuits and overall power consumption. An energy-to-time conversion circuit based on the delayed linear discharge method is proposed with high linearity and enhanced small-signal measurement ability, which allows FESA to use a fully time-based readout strategy so that a simple and robust interface for system-level integration is provided. Fabricated in 180 nm CMOS technology, FESA has been evaluated with an intrinsic timing jitter of 11.8 ps, a dynamic energy measurement range of 44 dB, a power consumption of 2.39 mW per channel, and an event rate of 4 MS/s. With an  $8\times 8$  Hamamatsu S13361-3050 SiPM array 1:1 coupled to an  $8\times 8$  lutetium yttrium oxyorthosilicate (LYSO) crystal array, the FESA-based detector exhibits a coincidence time resolution (CTR) of 237 ps FWHM and an energy resolution of 12.6%. The measured flood image with an  $8\times 8$  SiPM array 1:9 coupled to a  $24\times 24$  LYSO crystal array demonstrates the ability of FESA to decode a crystal size of 1 mm.

However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the trade-off between accuracy at the bank level and energy consumption of SRAM-based IMCs, which execute computations in the analog domain. To gain a complete understanding of IMC&#8217;s fundamental limits and design space, we first adopt the signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) as a metric, inspired by ADC design, to quantify the accuracy at the bank level. Second, we propose a methodology for accurately measuring SNDR. Finally, we propose a chip architecture for to directly measure pre-ADC SNDR. This characterization chip, incorporating mainstream IMC architectures, is fabricated in 28 nm CMOS technology. Measurement results indicate that SNDR and energy consumption are trade-offs that can be adjusted through the dot-product dimension and wordline voltage for charge/current summing models, and through input-driver voltage for a charge-redistribution model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental quantification of the trade-off between bank-level accuracy and energy consumption for SRAM-based IMC architectures through silicon measurements. These results underscore the importance of characterizing IMC SNDR to properly benchmark and compare future IMC designs.</description></item><item><title>A Complementary 3T-Based eDRAM Macro for High-Density Dual-Direction CAM and Logic-in-Memory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165429</link><description>Content-addressable memory (CAM) is regarded as an attractive solution for data-intensive applications with high-density search demands. To further improve functional flexibility yet at a low cost, several CAM macros have been developed to support multiple bit-wise logic operations. However, conventional SRAM-based CAM designs are constrained by the large bitcell area, posing significant challenges to achieve higher density. To address this issue, we propose a complementary 3T (C3T) based embedded dynamic random access memory (eDRAM) macro for high-density dual-direction CAM searching and logic-in-memory operations. First, we propose a compact C3T bitcell featuring a pair of complementary decoupled read ports, enabling dual-port read and efficient CAM operations. Second, we present a compact dynamic-circuit-based sense amplifier (DSA) to optimize the area of readout peripheral circuitry while mitigating the read bit line saturation issue. Additionally, we implement dual-direction CAM searching and logic-in-memory operations exploiting the C3T-based eDRAM macro. A 4 Kb C3T-based eDRAM macro has been validated in a commercial 40-nm CMOS process. Post-layout results demonstrate a 53% reduction in the bitcell area and a 58.1% reduction in the macro area compared to the state-of-the-art 6T compute SRAM. Moreover, the proposed design achieves a maximum frequency of 578 MHz for binary CAM (BCAM) searching operations and 694 MHz for logic operations, with energy consumption of 1.12 fJ/bit and 26.8 fJ/bit, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A High-Energy-Efficiency Lightweight BNN Accelerator for Arrhythmia Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224382</link><description>Arrhythmia poses a significant threat to human health. Accurate and real-time arrhythmia detection using electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is critical for medical diagnosis. With the rapid development of deep learning technologies, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have considerably improved the accuracy of arrhythmia monitoring. However, deploying these techniques on power-constrained wearable devices for real-time monitoring remains challenging. Lightweight designs have thus become essential for achieving low-power and high-throughput real-time detection with limited hardware resources. Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), as a promising lightweight method, exhibit significant potential in reducing hardware resource usage and enhancing inference speed. Nevertheless, existing binarized ECG detection accelerator designs have not yet conducted architectural Design Space Exploration (DSE), and therefore do not sufficiently balance the trade-off between throughput and power consumption. To address this, we propose a highly energy-efficient one-dimensional BNN accelerator for ECG detection. First, we develop a hardware-friendly BNN algorithm by eliminating fully connected layers and nonlinear computations. Subsequently, for the first time, this work utilizes Timeloop to analyze the optimal mapping of the BNN algorithm onto hardware, identifies the optimal accelerator dataflow, and conducts in-depth optimization of both the dataflow and the accelerator hardware circuits based on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) architecture. Finally, we introduce a prediction mechanism for fine-grained power control by dynamically disabling redundant computational logic. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed accelerator achieves a latency of 105.79&#8198; $\mu $ s, power consumption of 160 mW, throughput of 112.2 GOPS, and energy efficiency of 701.51 GOPS/W at 100 MHz.

However, the computational demands of LSTM inference often exceed the capabilities of resource-constrained microcontroller-based IoT devices. Efficient mapping of computational load onto hardware and software resources is a key challenge for improving performance while maintaining low power and a small area footprint. This paper presents a hardware-software framework that accelerates LSTM inference on edge devices by combining a modified LiteRT (formerly TensorFlow Lite) model running on a microcontroller (MCU) with a dedicated LSTM engine in a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) accelerator. To evaluate trade-offs between accuracy, latency, and energy efficiency, we introduce an LSTM benchmark suite for ultra-low-power tiny ML systems. Using this framework, experiments on various LiteRT-based LSTM architectures demonstrate up to 300x speedup compared to software-only implementations. For instance, the runtime for the HAR classification task is reduced from 1.8 seconds to just 6 milliseconds.</description></item><item><title>U-Sparta: A Unified Speech Processing Accelerator for Real-Time Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11230607</link><description>With the advancements in deep learning for speech processing and the rising popularity of smart devices, the demand for edge devices to support multiple speech processing applications is steadily increasing. However, existing unified AI platforms are unsuitable for such edge scenarios, while dedicated accelerators lack flexibility for diverse speech tasks, and current multi-task solutions remain limited in operator support and task coverage. In this work, we propose U-Sparta, a Unified Speech Processing Accelerator for Real-Time Applications. First, a decomposition scheme, comprising three dedicated strategies, is proposed to efficiently support various neural network operators for speech processing.

Despite these gains, such models suffer from pruning challenges that can negate their benefits. In this work, we identify the root cause of these challenges and introduce a novel method called synapse pruning, which is explicitly designed for L1NNs to overcome them for the first time. Building upon this algorithmic innovation, we present TRIM, an algorithm-hardware co-design framework that sparsifies and accelerates L1NNs to achieve ultra-high energy efficiency and speed. On the algorithmic side, we propose structured synapse pruning tailored for hardware-friendly  $\mathbb {N:M}$  sparsity patterns for L1NNs. On the hardware side, we introduce a sparse processor architecture that efficiently exploits both the proposed  $\mathbb {N:M}$  structured synapse sparsity and the intrinsic unstructured weight and activation sparsities in L1NNs by skipping redundant operations. Additionally, an  $\mathbb {N:M}$  sparsity-aware elastic mapping technique is introduced to maximize hardware utilization and data reuse. Evaluations on seven benchmarks demonstrate that TRIM achieves up to 87.5% unstructured sparsity and up to 81.3% structured sparsity with less than 1% accuracy loss.

Spiking neural networks (SNNs), which are inspired by biological brains, are event-based models, and therefore they can be used to process the binary data streams produced by such sensors naturally. However, SNN accelerators usually require more memory and longer time for inference, due to the extra time dimension in SNNs. In this paper, an energy efficient binary spiking neural network (BSNN) accelerator for DVS gesture recognition is proposed with algorithm and hardware codesign. We integrate the binary neural network (BNN) training method into SNN to directly train a BSNN model, which significantly reduces memory consumption. A temporal pooling (TP) layer is further proposed to reduce the time steps in SNNs while maintaining competitive accuracy. The proposed BSNN accelerator can achieve high parallelism with high resource utilization, and the sparsity of input spikes is utilized to further reduce power consumption. The proposed BSNN model achieves an accuracy of 95.49% on IBM DVS Gesture dataset. The implementation results show that the BSNN accelerator can achieve 38.2k inference per second with  $1.1~\mu $ J/inference energy consumption and 216.9 TOPS/W energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Efficient and Flexible Deep Learning Processor for Embedded Devices With 99.8% PE Utilization Under Low Silicon Cost</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11143600</link><description>The flexibility and efficiency of accelerator hinder the realization of DNN (Deep Neural Network) on embedded devices. How to design efficient and flexible deep learning processors to meet low-power requirements while supporting various iteratively updated deep neural networks, which is a major challenge in the current field.

Yet inherent device variations and high energy consumption for analog-digital conversion continue to hinder their wide-scale adoption in mainstream systems. To address these issues, this paper introduces WireLightning, a novel capacitive-computing accelerator featuring a mixed-signal architecture that rethinks analog AI acceleration. Unlike conventional analog crossbars that encode weights in programmable devices, WireLightning exploits intrinsic charge dynamics in passive capacitors, encoding matrix multiplication through spike amplitude and timing.

However, existing MolFCN design flows face critical challenges, including rigid clock-phase constraints, inefficient placement and routing, and the absence of accurate gate-to-device mapping. This paper introduces iFCN, an automated RTL-to-device-level design framework specifically optimized for MolFCN circuits. Building upon prior heuristic methods, iFCN incorporates inverter pruning at the RTL level to simplify circuit structure, utilizes Morton-coded linear quadtrees for efficient spatial indexing, and enhances A* routing to maximize path reuse for multi-fanout nets. To address limitations of fixed-phase clocking, we propose a hierarchical placement approach guided by Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN). The GCN learns connectivity-aware node embeddings that guide recursive partitioning and intra-layer ordering, significantly reducing wire crossings and improving placement quality. Subsequently, a lightweight adaptive method heuristically assigns clock phases to each layout layer, with careful consideration of timing and topological constraints. Additionally, we present an accurate gate-to-cell mapping algorithm to facilitate direct physical simulation and energy analyses. Benchmark results show a 30% reduction in runtime and a 10% improvement in layout area compared to our heuristic algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed method achieves comparable runtime performance to the state-of-the-art fiction tool, completing the layout of circuits with over 150 nodes in under one second. In addition, Comparative analyses against 12nm CMOS designs confirm that MolFCN circuits generated by iFCN exhibit superior area utilization and reduced power consumption, highlighting the practical potential of MolFCN for future ultra-low-power computing.

However, their significant computational requirements remains a major limitation. Although high-end Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Central Processing Units (CPUs) can solve the aforementioned problem, the cost and power consumption hinder the widespread adoption of 3-D LiDAR in commercial vehicles. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents a novel high-efficiency 3D mapping method that aims to achieve faster computation speeds than CPUs while providing better energy efficiency compared to GPUs. First, an optimized real-time LiDAR data preprocessing procedure is proposed, which is based on a fixed-point computation framework.

However, due to the lack of co-design of algorithm and hardware, there still remains space for optimizing the hardware architecture for softmax. Therefore, TEA-SPS is proposed as an algorithm and hardware co-designed architecture to improve softmax with two methods: Configurable Parallelism softmax with Sparse mask Strategy (CPSS) and Specific Piecewise Information Extractor (SPIE). CPSS has the advantage of supporting different throughput requirements through configurable data-level parallelism and performing sparse masking on the outputs to reduce the computational load and memory access of subsequent operations. To further explore the optimal solution set among the design space of parameters in CPSS, SPIE is proposed to achieve co-optimization of accuracy and hardware overhead. Based on them, the efficient hardware architecture of TEA-SPS is proposed. The implementation results show that at the frequency of 0.5 GHz under TSMC 90-nm technology, the peak efficiency of TEA-SPS processing 8-bit quantized data can reach up to 216.97 Gps/(mm $\boldsymbol {^{2}\cdot }$  mW), with the area of  $3290.21~\boldsymbol {\mu }$  m $\boldsymbol {^{2}}$  and the power consumption of 0.7004 mW.

For such energy systems, it is crucial to establish stability criteria with less conservatism, and equally important is to ensure computational tractability. This paper attempts to achieve this purpose from the perspective of characteristic exploiting in an exploratory manner. First, we exploit the sparse characteristic of the system matrices by separating state variables into delay-dependent and delay-independent categories, thus the reconstructed model is obtained. While maintaining equivalence to the original system, it improves the computational efficiency through reducing the dimension by more than 30%. Then, to address challenging higher-order time-varying delay terms and system matrix-Lyapunov matrix products, the variable-augmented free-weighting matrix method is applied. By exploiting such matrix characteristics, we justify the introduction of these matrices and derive the less conservative stability criteria. Finally, case studies show that, compared with existing results, the proposed method has increased the calculation accuracy measured by the average improvement rate of allowable maximum delay upper bound by at least 16.02%, and the calculation efficiency measured by the average calculation time has increased by more than 71.1%.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Fault-Tolerant Control Framework for EV Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer System Based on Self-Learning Predictor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11128874</link><description>This paper aims to develop a constant output voltage controller for dynamic wireless power transfer systems(DWPTSs) incorporating sensor noise filtering and fault tolerance. DWPTSs are designed to alleviate range anxiety in electric vehicles(EVs); however, the output voltage fluctuations are their significant drawback compared to static charging mode. Additionally, DWPTSs also face sensor measurement noise and potential faults that exacerbate system instability. To mitigate above challenges, a data-driven fault-tolerant control framework is designed for DWPTS based on a self-learning predictor, which implements constant voltage regulation with enhanced noise and fault immunity. Specifically, a self-learning predictor is integrated into the feedforward loop of a high-gain extended state observer (ESO) to filter sensor noise. Then, a data memory stack is constructed to store predicted states and estimated disturbances, and a concurrent learning algorithm is introduced to recover control gains online. Finally, a composite anti-disturbance control law is implemented to generate the required control signals for the charging circuit. A notable advantage of this scheme is its ability to simultaneously address both sensor noise and faults, ensuring a constant output voltage during EV driving. Experimental results validate that the designed control framework effectively eliminates output voltage fluctuations and measurement noise, even in the presence of sensor faults.</description></item><item><title>A Markov Tree Model for Cascading Failure Risk Assessment in Power Grid With Uncertain Renewable Energy Generation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11150496</link><description>The increasing penetration of renewable energy generation (REG) introduces significant uncertainty into power grids, posing heightened risks for cascading failures. In this paper, a Markov tree model is proposed to assess the risk of cascading failure in power grid with uncertain REG. The model captures the diverse failure paths caused by REG uncertainty, representing the cascading failure process as a sequence of state transitions with probabilities reflecting the likelihood of state transitions. To identify critical tripping branches during cascading failure propagation, a hybrid probability-interval method is introduced. Probabilistic power flow analysis identifies branches with overload risk, while interval positional relationships rank their severity. To improve the efficiency of risk assessment, a risk-based depth-first search (R-DFS) method is proposed. This method uses estimated risk indices to prioritize high-risk failure paths while pruning low-risk paths, significantly reducing simulation time while maintaining assessment accuracy. Compared with existing models, the proposed model balances simulation efficiency and accuracy, effectively identifying high-risk failure paths under REG uncertainty. Simulation results demonstrate the impact of threshold selection on the retention of high-risk paths and simulation performance, providing insights into managing cascading failure risks in power grid with high REG penetration.</description></item><item><title>Steady-State and Small-Signal Analysis of High-Ratio Hybrid Buck Converters With Enhancement to State-Space-Averaging Methodology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11136126</link><description>This paper proposes convergence enhancement to state-space averaging (SSA) methodology for steady-state and small-signal analysis of high-ratio hybrid DC-DC converters, first using analysis of Double-Step-Down (DSD) topology, including parasitics, as an example, then extending to other hybrid topologies with different numbers of capacitors and inductors. The enhanced SSA method can be used to: 1) derive small-signal control-to-output transfer functions, which is essential to optimize the compensator for fast and stable closed-loop operation; 2) calculate steady-state inductor currents, output voltage, input current and the voltage(s) across the flying capacitor(s),  $V_{CFs}$ , which is important to determine steady-state characteristics and performance; 3) include circuit non-idealities such as parasitics and timing mismatches; and 4) evaluate  $V_{CF}$  balancing property by the proposed matrix invertibility principle and added constants, and determine whether dedicated  $V_{CF}$  balancing circuits can be eliminated, which is considered an important benefit with reduced complexity and improved reliability. The theoretical results of DSD are then plotted in MATLAB and verified in simulations using PSIM and Cadence periodic transfer function (PXF) analysis, and measurement results using GaN devices. The simulation and measurement results match well with theoretical analysis. The enhancement is then extended beyond the DSD topology to analyze emerging hybrid topologies with more switched inductors and capacitors, future-proofing its capability to be applicable to new hybrid topologies.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Bifurcations on the Performance of Power Electronic Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11125513</link><description>This paper investigates the impact of bifurcations on the performance of power electronic circuits.

Interleaving errors due to time-skew are modeled as additive error terms through first-order Taylor expansion and are corrected by finite impulse response (FIR) differentiators. Computational complexity is substantially reduced by leveraging matrix binary decomposition technique. Furthermore, the increment-based adaption technique is employed to accelerate the convergence of coefficients estimation while maintaining low steady-state error. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach offers lower computational complexity and faster convergence compared to conventional methods. The proposed method is applied to an 11-bit, 3.5 GS/s, 8-channel time-interleaved SAR ADC fabricated in 28-nm CMOS.

Conventional RNN-based DPD suffers from three hardware bottlenecks: high-sampling-rate demands, sequential hidden-state dependencies that limit pipelining, and the latency&#8211;accuracy trade-off from large hidden sizes. LW-ResGRU addresses these issues by injecting residual connections at every recurrent layer, enabling stable depth scaling even with reduced hidden sizes.

For the front-end circuitry, selecting a diode that minimizes both conduction and leakage losses under specified operating conditions is challenging, as the forward voltage drop and reverse leakage current cannot be simultaneously reduced due to the device&#8217;s inherent physics. This brief presents a machine learning framework that predicts the DC output of diode-based AC-DC interfaces directly from specific voltage-current (V-I) characteristic points of the diodes and descriptive features of the excitation waveform. A physics-informed surrogate model is trained on SPICE-simulated data of rectifiers driven by experimentally captured cardiac harvester waveforms. Hardware validation with printed-circuit rectifiers powered by the same harvester source exhibits an average error of 0.03 V between prediction and measurement, matching the performance observed on the synthetic set and demonstrating robust generalization to real-world applications. This data-driven approach offers an instant, datasheet-only diode screening without circuit-level evaluation and can be integrated into automated multi-objective optimization flows for the design of low-power energy harvester AC&#8211;DC interfaces.</description></item><item><title>A 24-W 91.5% Peak Efficiency All-in-One Dual-Loop Controlled Quasi-Resonant Isolated DC&#8211;DC Converter With Adaptive Peak Current and Valley-Hysteresis-Locking Techniques</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11310826</link><description>This brief presents an all-in-one isolated DC-DC converter combines a primary flyback controller, secondary synchronous rectifier and digital isolator on a single chip.

Notably, ReSCIM (Wang et al., 2024) pairs an SRAM cell with a dedicated ReRAM crossbar, allowing ReRAM to serve as the local storage, significantly enhancing the storage capacity of the SRAM-CIM. The SRAM is custom-designed not only to serve as a storage element for CIM but also to function as a sense amplifier to retrieve the data from the ReRAM, which enables super high bandwidth of weight data loading into the CIM engine. However, existing mapping tools for CIM are inadequate for ReSCIM since they do not fully exploit the unique hardware characteristics and advantages of this novel architecture. In this work, we propose an analytical energy and latency model, which incorporates four key factors: hardware, workload, dataflow, and mapping (HWDM), for executing inference of NN on the ReSCIM accelerator. Specifically, we first characterize the ReSCIM accelerator hardware specifications and the NN layers. Next, we introduce three dataflows for ReSCIM, leveraging the high weight-loading bandwidth to reduce memory access for various workloads and layer types. Finally, we develop an algorithm to generate optimal mapping and dataflow strategies aimed at minimizing latency or energy consumption. Using our HWDM model, we design a tile-based ReSCIM accelerator and conduct extensive simulations to obtain the cycle-accurate latency and gate-level energy consumption metrics for inference across different NNs. We conduct design space exploration (DSE) using the HWDM model on a comprehensive set of benchmarks to minimize inference energy or latency. Experimental results show that our optimal ReSCIM accelerator achieves a 44% reduction in energy-delay-product (EDP) reduction compared to the weight stationary and fixed mapping baseline for SEResNet50. Moreover, our design exhibits  $1.74\times $  higher energy efficiency than the state-of-the-art hybrid TL-nvSRAM (Wang et al., 2023) accelerator on ResNet 18.</description></item><item><title>Self-SHE Pulse-Enabled 2-D Material-Based SOT-MTJ: A Scalable and Energy-Efficient Write Circuit for LiM Architectures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119676</link><description>Spin-orbit torque magnetic tunnel junction (SOT-MTJ) devices have gained significant attention for energy-efficient computing, particularly in Logic-in-Memory (LiM) architectures. However, conventional SOT-MTJ-based write circuits suffer from excessive power dissipation due to the reliance on externally generated spin hall effect (SHE) pulses, necessitating complex synchronization and additional circuit overhead. This work introduces a novel self-SHE pulse generation technique that eliminates the need for an external SHE pulse, simplifying the circuit design and significantly reducing energy consumption. Furthermore, the proposed design leverages 2-D material-based SOT-MTJs, which exhibit superior charge-to-spin conversion efficiency, thereby enhancing write performance. The proposed write circuit is integrated into a 1-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU), which is further extended to a 4-bit ALU to demonstrate scalability in LiM applications. Simulation results using 45-nm CMOS technology and Verilog-A models for 2-D SOT-MTJs indicate that the proposed write circuit achieves a 16.049% improvement in area efficiency and a 20.72% reduction in energy consumption compared to conventional SHE-assisted SOT-MTJ write circuits. Additionally, the full adder incorporating the proposed write circuit demonstrates a 25.2% improvement in energy efficiency over existing designs. Monte Carlo simulations validate the robustness of the proposed approach under variations in oxide layer and free layer thickness. By eliminating external SHE pulse requirements and utilizing 2-D SOT-MTJ technology, this work presents a significant advancement toward low-power, high-speed, and scalable spintronic computing architectures, making it a strong candidate for next-generation LiM-based processors.</description></item><item><title>MiniBuf: An On-Chip Buffer Allocation Framework Toward Minimizing Buffer Size and Latency for Memristor-Based CNN Accelerator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11130396</link><description>Memristor-based convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerators have gained considerable attention due to their low latency and high energy efficiency, making them promising candidates for edge acceleration. Alongside statically stored model weights, dynamically generated intermediate feature maps during inference occupy a significant portion of the on-chip buffer capacity and directly affect the efficiency of hardware pipeline execution. However, there is a lack of theoretical analysis and methods for efficiently allocating on-chip buffer for feature map data. To address this gap, this article implements three innovative aspects. First, a mathematical model is developed to estimate the minimal buffer size required for pipelined inference of CNNs on memristor-based accelerators, offering accurate and swift evaluations of the buffer size requirement. Second, based on this model, the article establishes mathematical conditions for buffer requirements to maintain a blocking-free pipeline during CNN inference, providing theoretical guidance for on-chip buffer allocation strategies. Third, a simulation-in-loop optimization method is proposed to further reduce latency by efficiently increasing the buffer size of critical layers. To validate our proposed model and method, evaluations were conducted on five representative models: ResNet-18, ResNet-50, YOLO-v5, U-Net, and Faster-RCNN-FPN. The results reveal a remarkably low average estimation error of only 2.6% between the mathematical model and the experimentally measured results, with the maximum error still below 10%. Moreover, our simulation-in-loop optimization strategy achieved significant latency reductions ranging from 5.3% to 57.5% across the five models.</description></item><item><title>iMAC: Toward Accelerating Deep Neural Networks by Predicting and Removing Ineffectual MAC Operations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11121663</link><description>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are employed in a broad range of classification tasks. Despite CNNs have reached high accuracy, they have high computational complexity, so employing this method in many applications, such as Internet of Things (IoT) is challenging. To overcome this challenge, CNN hardware accelerators are proposed. As the main activation function employed in the CNNs is ReLU, a large portion of the output becomes zero. Therefore, sparse CNN accelerators are proposed to reduce the computational complexity. Recent studies show that, rather than employing sparse CNN accelerators, it would be ideal to predict the zero outputs and remove the corresponding computations. In this article, we propose the iMAC accelerator to bypass ineffectual computations (a computation leads to zero). For this purpose, we propose a prediction unit that determines ineffectual computations without accuracy loss. Then we propose a dataflow to bypass ineffectual computations. The results show that by increasing 12% of area and 18% power overhead, iMAC achieves  $2.31\times $  speedup and  $1.95\times $  energy efficiency without any accuracy loss. With 3% accuracy loss, it further improves the speed and the energy by  $2.94\times $  and  $2.49\times $ , respectively. Moreover, compared to the previous prediction method, our method achieves higher speedup and improvement.</description></item><item><title>Robust and Optimal Loading of General Classical Data Into Quantum Computers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11129925</link><description>As standard data loading processes, quantum state preparation and block-encoding are critical and necessary processes for quantum-computing applications, including quantum machine learning, Hamiltonian simulation, and many others. Yet, existing protocols suffer from poor robustness under device imperfection, thus limiting their practicality for real-world applications. Here, this limitation is overcome based on a fan-in process designed in a tree-like bucket-brigade architecture. It suppresses the error propagation between different branches, thus exponentially improving the robustness compared to existing depth-optimal methods. Moreover, the approach here simultaneously achieves the state-of-the-art fault-tolerant circuit depth, gate count, and space&#8211;time allocation (STA). As an example of application, we show that for quantum simulation of geometrically local Hamiltonian, the code distance of each logic qubit can potentially be reduced exponentially using our technique.

By leveraging parallel interconnections and high-bandwidth communications inherent to 3-D-ICs, and the noise-resilience characteristics of spiking neural networks (SNNs), ApproxiMorph achieves significant power savings by exploiting 1) approximate implementation of neuron cells; 2) layer-wise approximation of SNNs through the heuristic exploration algorithm; 3) reduced-voltage operation in the 3-D-stacked SRAM; and 4) incorporating a weight-tuning method. As a result, to search for the energy-optimal layer-wise approximation, ApproxiMorph explores only 0.44%&#8211;0.67% of all possible combinations, achieving a 28.06% power saving for additions with a 0.60% accuracy loss in comparison to the baseline SNN for MNIST. In the VGG16 for CIFAR-10, ApproxiMorph searches around  $10^{3}$  combinations from over  $10^{17}$  possible solutions, resulting in a 29.16% power saving with slight accuracy gain. Furthermore, integrating all methods enhances the accuracy of approximate implementations and demonstrates higher error resilience than accurate implementations.</description></item><item><title>Fraggle: Reducing File Fragmentation on DRAM-Less SSD</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142317</link><description>Mobile devices adopt DRAM-less solid-state storage drives (SSDs) as the flash storage to reduce power consumption and manufacturing costs, yet DRAM-less SSDs are significantly impacted by file fragmentation, thereby degrading the responsiveness of mobile devices. Existing methods to mitigate file fragmentation, including preallocation and defragmentation, face critical limitations. Preallocation prevents file fragmentation by reserving contiguous free logical block address (LBA) space for individual files. However, in the limited LBA space exposed by the SSD, contiguous free space is gradually consumed and fragmented by scattered data blocks, reducing the effectiveness of preallocation. Defragmentation recovers file access performance by reorganizing fragmented file layouts into contiguous ones. However, when applied to DRAM-less SSDs, defragmentation introduces excessive cache eviction of dirty mapping entries to the slow Nand flash, causing significant performance disruption. This article presents Fraggle, a host-device co-design that mitigates file fragmentation on DRAM-less SSDs by preserving the efficacy of preallocation within an extended LBA space. To effectively manage the extended LBA space, Fraggle introduces two key components: 1) HashFTL, a compact, cache-efficient flash translation layer (FTL) mapping mechanism specifically optimized for DRAM-less SSDs and 2) a device-assisted space allocator that simultaneously reduces space allocation overhead and resolves layout imbalance issues in HashFTL caused by sparse LBA distribution. Evaluation results demonstrate that, compared to F2FS and state-of-the-art preallocation methods, Fraggle accelerates execution time by up to  $9.26\times $  and  $8.07\times $  under SQLite and real-world mobile application workloads.</description></item><item><title>A Novel MDM-Based Optical Networks-on-Chip With Reliability Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11124572</link><description>Ever-increasing demands for lower power loss, shorter transmission delay, and higher communication capacity have been a challenge in optical networks-on-chips (ONoCs).

In this article, we propose a flexible and scalable multimode optical switching element (MOSE) that adjusts transmitted optical signals by modifying its structure. A multimode optical router (MOR) based on the proposed MOSE is introduced, followed by the design of MDM-based optical mesh networks-on-chip (MMONoCs) that support parallel transmission of multiple TE-polarization mode optical signals. Additionally, loss and crosstalk models for multimode optical devices, including MOSE and MOR, are systematically established. In conclusion, the loss, optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR), and bit error rate (BER) for three TE-polarization modes (TE0, TE1, and TE2) at different network scales are analyzed using MOR as a specific example. The findings indicate that the scalability of MMONoC and its communication quality are mainly influenced by mode crosstalk noise. Furthermore, network performance metrics, including end-to-end (ETE) delay and throughput, are discussed based on two-mode (TE0, TE1) and three-mode (TE0, TE1, and TE2) optical signals at 1550 nm in  $4\times 4$  and  $5\times 5$  optical mesh networks. Simulation results demonstrate that MMONoC exhibits significant improvements in ETE delay and throughput compared to traditional single-mode optical modes.</description></item><item><title>Ultra Memory-Efficient On-FPGA Training of Transformers via Tensor-Compressed Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11121368</link><description>Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of machine learning tasks. There is growing interest in training transformers on resource-constrained edge devices due to considerations, such as privacy, domain adaptation, and on-device scientific machine learning. However, the significant computational and memory demands required for transformer training often exceed the capabilities of an edge device. Leveraging low-rank tensor compression, this paper presents the first on-FPGA accelerator for transformer training. On the algorithm side, we present a bi-directional contraction flow for tensorized transformer training, significantly reducing the computational FLOPS and intralayer memory costs compared to existing tensor operations. On the hardware side, we store all highly compressed model parameters and gradient information on chip, creating an on-chip-memory-only framework for each stage in training. This reduces off-chip communication and minimizes latency and energy costs. Additionally, we implement custom computing kernels for each training stage and employ intralayer parallelism and pipe-lining to further enhance run-time and memory efficiency. Through experiments on transformer models within 36.7 to 93.5 MB using forward propagation (FP)-32 data formats on the ATIS dataset, our tensorized FPGA accelerator could conduct single-batch end-to-end training on the AMD Alevo U50 FPGA, with a memory budget of less than 6-MB BRAM and 22.5-MB URAM. Compared to uncompressed training on the NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, our on-FPGA training achieves a memory reduction of  $30 \times $  to  $51 \times $ . Our FPGA accelerator also achieves up to  $4.0 \times $  less energy cost per epoch compared with tensor transformer training on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU. As an initial result, this article highlights the significant potential of large-scale tensor training on edge devices.</description></item><item><title>A High-Area-Efficiency Computing-in-Memory Deep Learning Accelerator Based on Weight-Sparsity Activation Compression and Sparsity Reciprocity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11129944</link><description>The large number of parameters in deep neural networks (DNNs) poses significant challenges for resource-constrained hardware. To address this, researchers have focused on model sparsity to skip redundant computations and improve inference speed and computing-in-memory (CIM) techniques to reduce data transfer delays and lower energy consumption. However, leveraging activation sparsity within CIM macros remains challenging due to its architectural limitations, leading to bottlenecks in this research direction. This study proposes an activation compression method based on the CIM structure and weight sparsity, along with a new approach called sparse reciprocity, to enhance model sparsity. A high-area-efficiency CIM-based accelerator chip was developed using these techniques and prior expertise. Experiments on various models and data precisions demonstrate an activation compression ratio of up to 54%, with the proposed accelerator achieving an area efficiency of 243 GOPS/mm2 for the VGG16 model and 363 GOPS/mm2 for the ResNet18 model.</description></item><item><title>RelOps: Reliability Optimization in Standard Cells Across PVT Variations in FinFET Digital Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11098498</link><description>FinFET, now firmly established in leading VLSI industries for their superior performance, exhibit heightened aging susceptibility that poses significant reliability challenges. The aggressive scaling of technology nodes has further compromised circuit reliability in recent years, highlighting the need for effective aging mitigation techniques. Recent advancements in the miniaturization of nanoscale technology have demonstrated the potential of optimizing performance parameters in standard cells using machine learning (ML) models and optimization algorithms through device sizing modifications. Building on this progress, we propose a methodology for optimizing performance parameters in 16 nm high-performance (HP) FinFET for the first time. The approach leverages a multiobjective optimization algorithm framework to mitigate aging impacts across process, voltage, temperature (PVT) variations while addressing negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) and hot carrier injection (HCI) effects by optimally adjusting FinFET design parameters, including channel length (lg), width (tfin), and height (hfin). With SPICE simulations, time-series datasets were generated to train ML models that achieved an R2 score exceeding 0.99 and a mean absolute percentage error below 1% across standard cells. Our approach yields a significant simulation speedup and a reduction in simulation workload compared to traditional SPICE simulations. Using the proposed optimization algorithm framework, we improved the power-delay product (PDP) by up to 36.97% under nonaging conditions and 34.94% with aging considered with respect to the nominal dimension at the fresh year, demonstrating significant performance gains for FinFET-based standard cells. The experimental results on 12 distinct complex cells validate the aging mitigation across years.</description></item><item><title>NPEva: An NoC-Based Neuromorphic Processors Performance Evaluation Framework for Benchmarking Spiking Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123508</link><description>spiking neural network (SNN) applications place diverse demands on neuromorphic processors&#8217; computational and communication capabilities. Specifically, the sparse parallel computation of SNNs requires storage systems capable of extensive parallel data access and processing. Additionally, the time-dependent nature of SNN computations demands a communication framework to manage spike transmission and synchronization. Addressing these requires continuous early stage evaluation of potential designs, which can be time-intensive. To this end, this article introduces a performance evaluation model for NoC-based neuromorphic processors, named NPEva, which includes a Computation Model (CpMo) and a communication model (CoMo). This model facilitates rapid, high-dimensional exploration of design spaces across a wide range of microarchitectural parameters. computation performance model (CpMo) quickly assesses computation-related latency, power consumption, and area by extracting relevant parameters from hierarchical storage organizations and neuron computation models. CoMo employs communication upper-bound latency analysis to evaluate packet latencies to reduce redundant synchronization time. Comparisons with TrueNorth&#8217;s publicly released data reveal that the model&#8217;s evaluation results are within an 8% error margin. The CoMo offers enhanced precision in estimating latency upper-bounds compared to other models like worst-contention delay (WCD) and worst-case traversal time (WCTT), especially when varying the number of VCs. With VC settings of 2, 4, 8, and 16, CoMo reduced latency by  $0.55\times $ &#8211; $2.53\times $  compared to WCTT and by  $0.83\times $ &#8211; $25.57\times $  compared to WCD. Additionally, using the NPEva model for exploring the design space of liquid state machines (LSMs) networks has shown that optimized hardware can improve cost efficiency by  $2.94\times $  with only a 1% increase in latency.</description></item><item><title>COMET-3D: Compute-in-Memory-Based Transformer Accelerator With Optimized Pipeline and 3D Heterogeneous Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11133480</link><description>Transformers have become the backbone of large language decoder and encoder models, but their compute- and memory-intensive nature makes them inefficient on traditional von Neumann architectures. Compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures offer a promising path forward by enabling in situ matrix operations and reducing memory access overhead. However, existing CIM-based accelerators suffer from: 1) unrealistic assumption of single-cycle activation of entire crossbar; 2) inefficient pipelines that are not optimized for operational unit (OU)-based execution; and 3) high analog-to-digital converter (ADC) cost. To address these limitations, we propose a latency-optimized pipeline tailored specifically for OU-based CIM execution and introduce COMET-3D&#8212;a 3D heterogeneous architecture that integrates static random-access memory (SRAM)- and ReRAM-based CIM arrays with a logic die containing digital MAC units and Softmax modules. The proposed architecture and dataflow maximize hardware utilization and enable efficient acceleration of the multihead self-attention (MHSA) layer. Experimental results across bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), generative pre-trained transformer (GPT2), and large language model meta AI (LLAMA) demonstrate that COMET-3D outperforms baseline architectures with similar compute resources by up to  $34\times $  in energy&#8211;delay product (EDP) for LLAMA, with gains of  $7.4\times $  for GPT2 and  $4.3\times $  for BERT-Large.</description></item><item><title>Binary Weight Multibit Activation Quantization for Compute-in-Memory CNN Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11112716</link><description>compute-in-memory (CIM) accelerators have emerged as a promising way for enhancing the energy efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Deploying CNNs on CIM platforms generally requires quantization of network weights and activations to meet hardware constraints. However, existing approaches either prioritize hardware efficiency with binary weight and activation quantization at the cost of accuracy, or utilize multibit weights and activations for greater accuracy but limited efficiency. In this article, we introduce a novel binary weight multibit activation (BWMA) method for CNNs on CIM-based accelerators. Our contributions include: deriving closed-form solutions for weight quantization in each layer, significantly improving the representational capabilities of binarized weights; and developing a differentiable function for activation quantization, approximating the ideal multibit function while bypassing the extensive search for optimal settings. Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, we show that BWMA achieves notable accuracy improvements over existing methods, registering gains of 1.44%&#8211;5.46% and 0.35%&#8211;5.37% on respective datasets. Moreover, hardware simulation results indicate that 4-bit activation quantization strikes the optimal balance between hardware cost and model performance.</description></item><item><title>Look-Up Table-Based Energy-Efficient Architecture for Neural Accelerators (LANA)</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11115133</link><description>Digital Von-Neumann implementations of neural accelerators are limited by high power consumption and area overheads, while Analog and non-CMOS implementations suffer from noise, device mismatch, and reliability issues. This article introduces a CMOS look-up table (LUT)-based architecture for neural accelerators (LANA) that reduces the power consumption and area overhead of conventional digital implementations through precomputed, faster LUT access while avoiding noise and mismatch challenges of analog circuits. To solve the scalability issues of conventional LUT-based computation, we use a divide-and-conquer (D&amp;amp;C) approach to split high-precision multiply accumulate (MAC) operations into lower-precision MAC. LANA achieves up to  $29.54 \times $  lower area with  $3.34 \times $  lower energy per inference task compared to traditional LUT (T-LUT)-based techniques and up to  $1.24 \times $  lower area with  $1.80 \times $  lower energy per inference task than conventional digital MAC (Wallace tree/array multipliers) without retraining and without affecting the accuracy of pretrained unpruned models, as well as on lottery ticket pruning (LTP) models that already reduce the number of required MAC operations by up to 98%. Finally, we introduce mixed precision analysis in the LANA framework for all LTP pruned and unpruned models (VGG11, VGG19, Resnet18, Resnet34, GoogleNet) that achieved up to  $29.59 \times $  (GoogleNet pruned)- $62.83 \times $  (VGG11 unpruned) lower area with  $3.34 \times $  (GoogleNet pruned)- $8.1 \times $  (VGG11 unpruned) lower energy per inference than T-LUT-based techniques, and up to  $1.24 \times $  (GoogleNet pruned)- $2.63 \times $  (VGG11 unpruned) lower area requirement with  $1.81 \times $  (GoogleNet pruned)- $4.37 \times $  (VGG11 unpruned) lower energy per inference across models as compared to conventional digital MAC-based techniques with ~1% accuracy loss relative to the baseline.</description></item><item><title>DCTDSE: A Bimodal Design Space Exploration Flow via Discrete&#8211;Continuous Transformation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11115145</link><description>The conservation core accelerator presents a promising avenue for improving the computational efficiency of specific applications. However, its design space is ultrahigh-dimensional, significantly increasing the exploratory effort required to identify the optimal design across performance, power, and area metrics. Furthermore, the discrete nature of the microarchitecture space renders conventional search methods ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we propose the discrete&#8211;continuous transformation to speedup design space exploration, namely, DCTDSE. It can operate in either offline or online mode. In offline mode, it transforms the original discrete design space into a continuous space, builds predictive models, performs parallel gradient-based optimization, and maps the results back to the discrete domain. In the online mode, DCTDSE refines the models by iteratively resampling previously found solutions, thereby enhancing exploration quality while maintaining moderate runtime overhead. Experimental results indicate that DCTDSE achieves a  $3.9{\times }$  to  $40{\times }$  speedup over benchmark methods in offline mode. In online mode, it provides a  $2.5{\times }$  speedup, with a 21% reduction in exploration quality relative to the most accurate comparison method.</description></item><item><title>MultiLens: A Multiobjective Adaptive DVFS Framework for Energy-Efficient DNN Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11121410</link><description>To tackle power management challenges in deep neural networks (DNNs), dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) has gained attention for its ability to enhance energy efficiency without modifying DNN structures. However, current DVFS methods, which rely on historical data, such as processor utilization and task load, suffer from issues like frequency ping-pong, response lag, and limited generalizability. These challenges are exacerbated by real-world scenarios that prioritize time, energy, or energy efficiency differently, making it even harder for existing methods to effectively configure DVFS under such multiobjective constraints or tradeoffs. This article presents multilens (MTL), a multiobjective adaptive DVFS framework. First, we propose a power-sensitive feature extraction method along with multiobjective constraint modeling to characterize DNN inference behavior. Second, critical power blocks are then identified through clustering based on inference behavior similarity, enabling adaptive DVFS instrumentation point settings. Moreover, to enhance the adaptability of multiple platforms and the flexibility of multiple scenarios, MTL integrates a complete deployment process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the MTL in optimizing energy efficiency across different hardware platforms and deployment scenarios.</description></item><item><title>An Analytical Model for Performance-Carbon Co-Optimization of Edge AI Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142328</link><description>Application-specified integrated circuit (ASIC) accelerators have emerged as vital solutions to deploy various AI workloads, especially in resource-constrained edge scenarios. Existing analytical models for guiding the architectural exploration of these accelerators focus solely on performance and energy efficiency metrics while overlooking the carbon cost. In contrast, existing carbon cost models focus on analyzing specific hardware configurations but lack the support for exploration of the optimal architecture choices and the tradeoff analysis between performance and carbon cost. To fill this gap, this brief aims to analyze the impact of different architecture configurations from both the performance and carbon perspectives, exploring the tradeoff between the performance and carbon cost for AI accelerator design. For this purpose, we first built an analytical model, named CarbonSpot, capable of modeling and estimating both performance and carbon cost for any accelerator architecture in the design space. Then, by benchmarking the overhead of these AI accelerators under MLPerf-Tiny and MLPerf-Mobile workloads, we show that architectures solely optimized for performance and energy efficiency produce  $58\times $  more carbon emissions than designs designed for the highest carbon efficiency. Importantly, co-optimized architectural choices exist, with only &lt;20% drop in performance and &lt;6% overhead in carbon costs when compared to the respective best cases optimized for either maximum performance or minimal carbon impact.

Research is currently directed toward leveraging resistive random-access memories (RRAMs) among various memristive devices. In conjunction with complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies within integrated circuits (ICs), RRAM devices are used to build such neural accelerators. In this study, we present a neural accelerator hardware design and verification flow, which uses a lookup table (LUT)-based Verilog-A model of IHP&#8217;s one-transistor-one-RRAM (1T1R) cell. In particular, we address the challenges of interfacing between abstract ANN simulations and circuit analysis by including a tailored Python wrapper into the design process for resistive neural hardware accelerators. To demonstrate our concept, the efficacy of the proposed design flow, we evaluate an ANN for the MNIST handwritten digit recognition task, as well as for the CIFAR-10 image recognition task, with the last layer verified through circuit simulation. Additionally, we implement different versions of a 1T1R model, based on quasi-static measurement data, providing insights on the effect of conductance level spacing and device-to-device variability. The circuit simulations tackle both schematic and physical layout assessment. The resulting recognition accuracies exhibit significant differences between the purely application-level PyTorch simulation and our proposed design flow, highlighting the relevance of circuit-level validation for the design of neural hardware accelerators.</description></item><item><title>Super-Vth Standard Cells With Improved EDP: Design and Silicon Validation in 65nm LP CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119649</link><description>The ever-increasing computational load and shrinking power budget have accentuated the need for energy-efficient operation of edge devices. In this article, a combination of static CMOS logic and hybrid pass transistor logic with Static CMOS output (HPSC), which has no floating or weak nodes and is thus as robust to noise as static CMOS logic, is used for designing toolchain-compatible super- $\text {V}_{\text {th}}$  standard cells. Optimized HPSC variants of a 2/3-input XOR cell, a 2/3-input XNR cell, a half adder cell, a full adder cell, and two variants of a 1-bit multiply&#8211;accumulate combinational cell are presented in a commercial 65nm low-power CMOS technology. Measurements of test structures based on ring oscillators and dummy path techniques show an average frequency and average energy-delay product improvement of up to 30.3% and 32.5%, respectively, at typical conditions. The proposed cells&#8217; superior performance compared to the commercially available standard cells is also highlighted in terms of propagation delay, leakage, and dynamic power consumption. This shows a promising approach for foundries or other commercial entities to improve digital design performance to about half a technology node at no additional cost.</description></item></channel></rss>
