First, methods to build the neural network power loss model and to extract data automatically for neural network training are introduced. Then, an indirect coupling strategy is applied for the bidirectional coupling between the power loss model and COMSOL thermal model. To address the challenge of balancing simulation accuracy and efficiency in the proposed coupling strategy, an adaptive time step adjustment algorithm based on Lagrange interpolation functions is designed. Finally, quantitative comparisons of different simulation methods and experiments validate the high precision and efficiency of the proposed method.

In addition, the motor cannot continue to output power with the disconnected drive. Therefore, this article proposes a topology reconfiguration OWD (TR-OWD) with a protection circuit that can quickly isolate an inverter short-circuit fault and reconfigure the drive topology after the fault. The current flow of the protection circuit during the fault transient and the transient and resonant state model are revealed first. Subsequently, based on the step current or voltage signals generated by the faulty inverter, the topology reconfiguration and voltage vector switching of the TR-OWD are presented, maintaining the original operating state of the motor. Finally, the experimental results of the motor with no-load and load conditions are shown to validate the effectiveness of the proposed short-circuit fault-tolerant design of the OWDs. The experimental results also verify the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Fixed-Frequency K+D Modulation of Modular Multilevel Resonant DC&#8211;DC Converters for Output Voltage Overshoot Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753622</link><description>Modular multilevel resonant dc&#8211;dc converters (MMRDCs) are emerging as a competitive solution for medium wide input voltage&#8211;low voltage conversion, yet they often encounter output voltage overshoot when submodules insert or extract. In this article, a novel K+D control scheme of MMRDCs is proposed, which combines both inserted submodule number $K$ and adjusting width $D$. Output voltage overshoot could be greatly suppressed and soft switching characteristics could also be improved enormously based on the proposed K+D modulation strategy. The design of magnetic components would benefit from fixed-frequency control. Continuous dc voltage gain is analyzed which could effectively simplify the control loop. Simulations on a 200 kW MMRDC that converts 9&#8211;18 kV to 750 V have been presented to verify the effectiveness of theoretical analysis and control strategies.

This controller is designed to provide the fast and robust dynamic response while maintaining the moderate computational cost, making it suitable for real-time industrial microcontrollers. An accurate discrete-time model of the grid-connected PCS is derived to enable a closed-form solution, and the 3-D current reference tracking problem, incorporating the varying dc-link voltage of the BESS, is formulated as a multiparametric quadratic program. For this optimization problem, the constrained optimal control law is shown to be the accurate orthogonal projection of the unconstrained solution onto the corresponding active voltage constraint. Subsequently, an efficient geometric method is developed to obtain the analytic optimal control in the general case, enabling the online application of MPC with a long prediction horizon for industrial PCS. Moreover, a disturbance observer is combined with the predictive current controller to ensure offset-free tracking and robustness against system uncertainties. Simulation and experimental results on a 20 kVA PCS demonstrate the fast dynamics, low total harmonic distortion, strong robustness, and high computational efficiency of the proposed current controller.</description></item><item><title>An Open-Circuit Fault-Tolerant Scheme for Single-Phase Current-Fed Dual-Active-Bridge DC/DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10755171</link><description>Power interruptions are intolerable in many industrial applications, so high reliability becomes exceedingly pivotal to power converters. Fault-tolerant schemes attract more attention as an effective approach to improve reliability. However, due to the low-device-redundancy and asymmetrical structure, fault-tolerant schemes have not yet been reported on the single-phase current-fed dual-active-bridge (CF-DAB) converters. To address this challenging issue, an open-circuit fault-tolerant scheme is proposed in this article. With the proposed fault-tolerant scheme, the single-phase CF-DAB converter can maintain power delivery even if facing the open-circuit faults of two specific switches and the middle capacitor. Meanwhile, potential voltage spikes can also be suppressed effectively without the snubber function of the middle capacitor, which protects the switching devices from high-voltage stresses. Subsequently, the modulation scheme, mode characters, and control structure are elaborated. Finally, the experimental results based on a scale-down laboratory prototype are presented to verify the feasibility of the proposed fault-tolerant scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Soft Startup Method With Natural Short-Circuit Tolerance Features for CLLC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10759836</link><description>The CLLC converter is a high-frequency, high-efficiency isolated bidirectional dc&#8211;dc converter. In outdoor application scenarios like electric vehicle fast charging station, short-circuit failure caused by harsh environments is very challenging for the CLLC converter. Especially, such short-circuit failure is more likely occurring in startup stage. In this article, a soft startup method with natural short-circuit tolerance features is proposed for CLLC converters. A special fixed frequency fixed duty cycle driving scheme is designed and used for realizing soft startup. An operation mode analysis is conducted for proposed soft startup driving scheme, showing its detailed working process and energy transmission characteristics. Besides, a practical startup method using proposed soft startup driving scheme is also illustrated. To clarify the mechanism of natural short-circuit fault tolerance features in the proposed method, a comprehensive dynamic state trajectory analysis is provided, showing that the dynamic state trajectory after short-circuit failure can be restricted within a boundary automatically. As a result, very large short-circuit current is avoided and natural short-circuit tolerance features is realized. Finally, a lab-level prototype is built to verify the proposed method and the corresponding analysis. Experimental results proves that the proposed method achieves excellent short-circuit tolerance performance (short-circuit current is less than 4% of that in conventional method) and similar soft startup performance compared to the conventional method.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Control of Current Sensorless PFC Three-Phase Vienna Rectifier With Balanced and Unbalanced DC-Link Voltage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10764762</link><description>In the utilization of three-phase power, the dc-link voltage of the Vienna rectifier can function as two separate voltage sources, accommodating the need for varied output voltages. The voltage-oriented control is usually used to achieve proportional adjustment of the output capacitor voltage, but this typically requires an increased number of sensors. Therefore, this article proposes a current-sensorless control for a three-phase Vienna rectifier. To reduce circuit volume and cost, the Vienna rectifier topology is analyzed, and a current-sensorless control structure is implemented to minimize circuit volume and cost. Considering the limitation of the single voltage loop in the current-sensorless structure, which affects the output transient response, this article also proposes a feedforward control architecture. By predicting the steady-state condition of the Vienna circuit in advance, error tracking compensation is performed to improve voltage transient response and compensate for the nonideal power semiconductor devices. Additionally, integrating the zero-sequence compensation to achieve mitigation of zero-crossing distortion of the input current in power factor correction as well as active balanced and unbalanced output voltage. Finally, through the experimental results of a 2.4 kW Vienna converter, the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed method are validated.</description></item><item><title>Ripple Current Reduction in DC-Link Capacitor for a Single-Phase Two-Stage Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769050</link><description>The single-phase two-stage inverter is a common energy conversion unit for emerging decarbonization applications, such as residential photovoltaics systems. Specifically, a dc&#8211;dc converter and an inverter are connected back-to-back with a dc-link capacitor serving as an energy buffer. The reliability of this unit depends on the lifespan of the dc-link capacitor, which decreases significantly with the rms value of the capacitor current. This article proposes a simple but effective method to reduce the switching-frequency capacitor ripple current, which can extend the capacitor lifespan and increase the reliability of the energy conversion unit. The proposed method manipulates the switching pattern of the dc&#8211;dc converter by modifying its carrier waveform. Since the duty cycle is unaffected, the method is compatible with any existing carrier-based control scheme. Experimental results are obtained to verify the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>An Overview of Mechanical Characterization for Power Module: Challenges, Advances, and Future Prospects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10756526</link><description>Driven by advancements in the semiconductor technology, especially silicon carbide, numerous packaging designs have been developed to meet demands of various applications.

Three-stage gate drive (TSGD) can mitigate the conflict between switching speed and losses, but it is challenging to achieve minimal switching loss under the existing TSGD strategy due to the nonlinear parasitic capacitance of GaN HEMT. To address this issue, this article proposes a minimal switching loss TSGD strategy based on a dynamic dv/dt switching (DVTS) model, which can achieve minimal switching loss. First, based on the charge conservation principle, piecewise linear equivalent values for the parasitic capacitances of GaN HEMT are calculated. Based on the result, analytical expressions for the transient voltage and current in each switching stage are derived, which forms the DVTS model and provides detailed analysis for the dv/dt nonlinearity. Furthermore, analytical expressions for switching loss during each stage are calculated, establishing the quantitative relationship between switching loss and drive conditions. By minimizing the total loss, the required driving currents and switching timings are determined. Finally, the MSL-TSGD strategy is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method reduces the turn-on loss by 18.6%, and reduces the turn-on delay by 29.3%.</description></item><item><title>High-Frequency Bipolar Pulse Transformer With an Undershoot Damping Circuit for Tumor Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10755116</link><description>High-frequency irreversible electroporation (H-FIRE), which employs high-frequency bipolar pulses (HFBPs) with high voltage has been successfully used for tumor ablation with the inhibition of muscle contraction. This article designs an undershoot damping circuit with magnetic isolation drive embedded (MI-UD) in main topology of step-up transformers to reduce the undershoot voltage resulting from the energy release of excitation inductance and improve the pulse frequency when outputting HFBPs. The proposed main circuit topology could generate HFBPs with one magnetic core, and no additional magnetic core reset circuit is needed for the excitation inductance. Moreover, the designed drive circuit only needs two control signals with delayed turn-off, including the controls of the MI-UD circuit. Theoretical analysis, simulation, and experimental test indicate that three modules of step-up pulse transformer could output HFBPs. The pulse amplitude could reach &#177;3 kV with the voltage gain of 11.1 (ratio of 1:4, three modules) and dc supply of 270 V. The pulsewidth ranges from 300 ns to 2 &#956;s. A total energized time of 100 &#956;s within the burst can be achieved to meet the H-FIRE treatment. The maximum frequency is 400 kHz within the burst. The undershoot at 2 &#956;s and &#177;3 kV is only 3.3%.</description></item><item><title>Kalman Filter Based Detection Scheme for DC-Link Voltage Measurement Faults in MMC-HVDC Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10757310</link><description>The dc-link voltage control technology is of great importance to the stable operation of the modular multilevel converter high voltage direct current (MMC-HVdc) system. Currently, most control methods need to acquire the actual dc-link voltage, which is obtained from the complicated dc voltage measuring device. The faults of the measuring device have occurred many times in recent years, causing the dc-link voltage controller failure and affecting the safety and stability of the system.

Most of the existing SOP projects adopt the back-to-back modular multilevel converter (BTB-MMC) topology. However, the BTB-MMC requires a large number of submodules, which is costly and bulky.

The proposed converter combines an isolated DAB converter and an interleaved nonisolated dual floating boost (DFB)converter. As the power demand of auxiliary loads in the vehicles rapidly increases due to autonomous and entertainment systems, a dual auxiliary voltage (48 and 12 V) system is introduced to mitigate the burden of high current. The high voltage gain feature of the DFB converter ensures that the operating duty remains around 0.5, reducing filter size, turn-off current, and circulating current, and increasing the power transfer capability from the high voltage side. Additionally, the lower voltage stress on the low-side switches allows for the use of switches with lower RDS,on, reducing conduction losses.

The dual inverter, used to drive an open-end winding permanent magnet synchronous motor can output a higher voltage than a single inverter with respect to the same dc voltage. However, the dual inverter, which has six legs, has twice as many switching actions as a single inverter composed of three legs during one switching period. The increased switching actions cause power loss of the switch and reduce the efficiency of the system. In this article, a new pulsewidth modulation technique is proposed that secures the clamping sections by using switching state combinations and space vector combinations to minimize power loss. The proposed combinations consist of active vectors and zero vectors corresponding to space vectors considering the relationship between the voltage vectors of the primary and secondary inverters to clamp four of the six legs. The switching state combinations are configured differently for sectors divided by the angle of the stator current to select the clamping sections considering the power factor. In addition, they equalize the upper and lower clamping sections by distributing the zero vectors. The validity of the proposed technique is verified through simulation and experiment.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Crosstalk Suppression Method With Miller Clamp Circuit for GaN HEMTs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758264</link><description>Gallium nitride (GaN) power devices exhibit noteworthy characteristics, such as high switching speeds and low conduction losses, thereby facilitating enhanced efficiency and power density in switching power converters. Nevertheless, the advantages of high switching speeds and low conduction thresholds in GaN power devices also render them susceptible to bridge-leg crosstalk. To resolve the above issue, a novel miller clamp gate driver (NMCGD) is proposed. The detailed working principles of NMCGD are first elucidated in this article. In NMCGD, it utilizes the negative voltage to make the bipolar junction transistor (BJT) in a saturated state during the shutdown process of GaN. This action effectively short-circuits a portion of the drive resistor, reducing the impedance of the drive loop and suppressing crosstalk, which also reduces gate turn-on oscillation while ensuring prompt turn-on and turn-off speeds. At the same time, the parameter design and device selection criteria are presented.

Additionally, a bus switch control strategy suitable for this circuit is proposed to reduce the discharge time and energy required by the bus capacitor, thus reducing the required bus capacitance of the system. Compared to the traditional motor drive systems, the proposed system allows for the use of film capacitors instead of electrolytic capacitors, resulting in a reduced system volume and improved reliability and power density. Moreover, compared to the existing researches, the proposed system can more fully utilize the ac source to charge the bus capacitor, thereby improving the efficiency of the ac source, and simultaneously enhancing the power quality of the ac source.

The shorter rise time of the voltage pulses confines the cable length between the inverter and the motor in practice to avoid overvoltage across the motor stator windings. Even with shorter cables, voltage spikes from variable-speed drives can still cause premature insulation failure and reduce the remaining useful lifetime of the motors. While effective, conventional methods such as $dv/dt$ passive filters or active gate drivers are usually bulky and/or inefficient. To address this problem, an overvoltage mitigation solution, named &#8220;Smart Coil,&#8221; is introduced in this article. The smart coil circuit is installed in parallel with the first coil of each motor phase, which typically experiences the highest reflected overvoltage. Upon detection of overvoltage, the proposed ultracompact smart coil circuit, located at the motor junction box, is activated to limit voltage stress across the coils. Since the smart coil is connected in parallel with the first coil, it only needs to process very low pulsed power during the overvoltage transients. Therefore, it has high efficiency and an ultracompact footprint while effectively mitigating voltage spikes. The proposed smart coil circuit can be easily scaled for various motor-drive systems regardless of the cable length or rise time of the switching devices. Simulation and experimental test results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Practical Control Method for Single-Phase Input PMSM Drives With Small DC-Link Capacitor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10759324</link><description>The primary function of the large electrolytic dc-link capacitor in the single-phase input motor drives is to enhance dc voltage stability by minimizing voltage fluctuations. Because they are both bulky and unreliable components, reducing the size of dc-link capacitors or substituting them with significantly low capacitance value film capacitors offers numerous advantages. This article introduces a method that allows using a voltage source inverter with a small film dc-link capacitor, which results in equivalent performance to high-value capacitor drives. In this approach, the effect of dc-link voltage ripple is designed as a periodic disturbance in the current loop. A proportional-integral-resonant (PIR) control strategy is implemented to eliminate the designed double-line frequency disturbance observed in motor currents, thereby ensuring a smooth motor torque response. This solution meets crucial criteria for home appliances, specifically addressing input current harmonic requirements through power factor correction while effectively reducing the adverse effects of substantial dc-link ripple on motor torque, even when employing a film capacitor (10&#8211;50 $\mu$F range). The proposed framework is experimentally tested on permanent magnet synchronous motors with fan-load and dynamometers. Experimental results demonstrate, with PIR, an 80% reduction in current and torque ripple occurring due to the use of a low-value dc-link film capacitor. This also achieves performance within $\pm 5\%$ of the results obtained with a drive equipped with a 1200 $\mu$F dc capacitor. In addition, the line-side power factor exceeds 0.98 for loads exceeding 8% of the rated power.</description></item><item><title>Online Condition Monitoring of Bonding Wires Lift-Off in Power Modules Based on Magnetic Field Measurement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10759846</link><description>Wire-bonding type power modules are among the most widely used power semiconductor module packages in recent years, with bonding wires being one of the weakest links in these modules. Under the long-term effects of power cycling and temperature fluctuations, stress and strain make bonding wires prone to cracking, eventually leading to breakage or detachment, which affects the reliability of power modules. Therefore, monitoring the health condition of power modules is crucial. This article proposes a method for real-time monitoring of bonding wire lift-off using a single-axis magnetic field sensor. The article first analyzes the magnetic field near the bonding wires of the power module, indicating that the magnetic field changes when bonding wires lift off. Second, finite-element method is used to simulate the magnetic field and identify the region with the highest rate of magnetic field change due to bonding wires lift off, where the magnetic field sensor is placed to achieve the highest monitoring sensitivity. Additionally, by using a temperature compensation method, the change in magnetic field sensor sensitivity due to temperature variations was reduced. This method decreased the sensitivity deviation caused by temperature changes from approximately 30% to less than 1%. In the experiment, the bonding wires of two types of power semiconductor modules were monitored. Using a magnetic field to current ratio deviation of &#177;5% as the standard, the occurrence of bonding wire lift-off could be accurately detected.</description></item><item><title>A 5.5&#8211;276 W Integrated Photovoltaic Energy Harvesting System With 99.95% MPPT Efficiency and 98.74% Power Conversion Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771609</link><description>A high-efficiency integrated photovoltaic (PV) energy harvesting system based on direct current resistance (DCR) current sensing is proposed.

The finite switching frequency of electronic devices results in the coexistence of dc and harmonic currents in HVDC transmission lines. In this article, a novel method for harvesting harmonic magnetic field energy is proposed for the first time utilizing a free-standing magnetic field energy harvester (FSMFEH). Compared with current transformer-based magnetic field energy harvesters with closed toroidal cores, the designed arc-shaped core effectively avoids saturation caused by high dc currents. The ac magnetic field generated by the harmonic current induces a voltage in the coil and transfers power to the load. The working principle, equivalent circuit, load power and reliability of the FSMFEH are analyzed and experimentally verified. By optimizing the core structure and selecting the core material, the FSMFEH achieves a load power of 25.79 mW and a power density of 0.279 mW/cm3 under the condition of 1000 A dc current superimposed with a 3A/60 0 Hz harmonic current. The designed FSMFEH is capable of meeting the power requirements for most sensors in HVDC transmission lines.</description></item><item><title>Pulse Magnitude Modulation and Token Rotation-Based Voltage Balancing Method of Multilevel Inverter for Wireless Power Transfer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10767733</link><description>The multilevel inverter has attracted more and more attention in high-power wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, but its switching loss and capacitor voltage balancing are worrying issues.

However, it can only operate under high power factor (PF) conditions with this modulation strategy. In this article, the reactive power flow capability of each voltage vector is analyzed for the eight-switch TP-TLI. Based on this, a novel virtual space vector modulation (VSVM) is proposed. In each sector, it defines one virtual small vector and uses the vectors which are viable for full operation range of lagging PF. Hence, the proposed VSVM achieves full operation range of lagging PF. Besides, an active neutral point voltage control (NPVC) strategy is also proposed. Only one coefficient needs to be calculated, so the calculation is simple. In addition, it considers both the NPV fluctuation and the NP current introduced by the selected virtual small vector, and it can provide zero, positive, and negative NP current. Hence, it is accurate to control the NPV, and it could balance the NPV without obvious dc offset and ac ripples under all PF conditions and modulation indexes. The proposed modulation and control strategies are verified by experiment results with a 3 kVA prototype.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Topology and Design Methodology for Improved Power Quality of High-Power Charger</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10601658</link><description>This article introduces a novel topology and design methodology of a high-power charger.

However, the existing WPT-based VEs fail to balance the cells once the onboard receiver (Rx) is away from the transmitter (Tx), and the efficiency and capacity are limited. This article proposes a reconfigurable WPT-based multiport hybrid charging approach to achieve UAV&#8217;s cell string balancing under multiple states. By converging one Tx port, one Rx bidirectional port, and two voltage-balance (Vx) driving ports, the approach enables the source-to-cell (STC) and pack-to-cell (PTC) charging/balancing, which achieves cell balancing during charging, discharging, and standing conditions. Circuit analyses of the corresponding topology validate its operating principles and basic performance. Efficiency and capacity in the STC balance mode are improved with the combined Rx and Vx output ports. The cell&#8217;s voltage equivalation can still be realized without Tx in the PTC balance mode. Asymmetric Tx and Rx coils and orthogonal Vx coils integrated into Rx are designed with specific coupling or decoupling as the multiport WPT coupler to enable the charging and balancing with a robust misalignment tolerance. An experimental prototype for eight cells is established, and the test results demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Family of High Step-Up Interleaved DC-DC Converters Based on the Coupled Inductors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586749</link><description>This article proposes a series of high-step-up interleaved dc&#8211;dc converters utilizing coupled inductors and quadratic voltage gains.

For high-frequency alternating input voltage, which is conventionally used in wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, the high-order harmonic components are usually regarded as interferences to the system. However, this proposed WPDT solution, instead of filtering the high-order harmonics, uses it as the combined source for simultaneous power and driving signal transmission. Thus, it is possible to design the system for two resonance frequency channels with arbitrary primary currents for control. As a result, the transmission currents for the main power and driving signals can be automatically modulated on the primary side, while demodulated for the two channels on the secondary side. All the control can be completed through only one full-bridge converter. The experimental prototype successfully demonstrates that the system can be flexibly shifted between two modes for 1/0 driving signal transmission while maintaining the stability of the output power with high efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Multiple Frequency Spectrum Impedance Matching Method of Nonlinear Geological Surveying Electromagnetic Method for Power Amplifier Capacity Utilization Enhancement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586773</link><description>This article proposes a multiple frequency spectrum impedance matching method to extend the applying environment of the impedance matching technology from linear sinusoidal voltage to nonlinear voltage in the electromagnetic method (EM) of geological survey.

Although SiC devices are known to reduce switching losses, a snubber is essential to mitigate the high dv/dt ratio on the switch&#8217;s drain&#8211;source voltage, which results from the surge in current when the SiC switch is turned off. This work proposes a floating-voltage source (FVS)-based snubber, presenting a single-circuit solution that provides soft turn-off (ringing suppression) capabilities for multiple power switches in MLC. Moreover, it ensures that this soft turn-off feature is consistently effective across all duty-cycle (D) ratios of the MLC without any constraint. This work also presents two approaches for realizing the FVS-based snubber: dissipative and energy-regenerative methods. In this article, a prototype of a 7-kW three-level flying-capacitor buck (TLFCB) converter with a 537 VDC input is developed. This prototype successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed snubber across D ranging from 0.2 to 0.8.</description></item><item><title>Design of a High-Voltage Low-Ripple Converter With High-Frequency Dickson Multipliers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10595839</link><description>High-voltage, low-ripple dc-dc converters are essential in various industrial and scientific applications.

To address this problem, an adaptive current-limiting control (ACLC) method, which is based on the bridge arm current, has been proposed. A dynamic ACLC model, aiming to suppress the fault current, has been constructed by introducing of a bypass ratio that reduces the dc voltage. This model incorporates the bridge arm current as a critical variable, giving a linearized current limit suppression curve for adaptive bypass ratio output. Additionally, the ac/dc coupling mechanism within the converter has been thoroughly analyzed. The influence of the ACLC on the ac side current has been examined, providing a theoretical basis for the upper limit of the bypass ratio constraint in both strong and weak ac systems. A half-bridge high-voltage direct current transmission technology based on the modular multilevel converter (HB-MMC-HVDC) network model was built in the real-time digital simulator to test the proposed ACLC method.

The proposed converter comprises an interleaved current-fed bridge and a voltage quadrupler rectifier with a bidirectional switch on the primary and secondary sides of the transformer, respectively, for achieving high-voltage gain and zero input current ripple. Furthermore, it can achieve an additional increase in voltage gain by adjusting the duty cycle of the bidirectional switch, even with a fixed duty cycle of 0.5, which simultaneously ensures ripple-free input current. So, these structural advantages allow the converter to achieve a much higher voltage gain with the least transformer turns-ratio value than existing step-up converters. The voltage quadrupler also makes the output component's voltage stress half the output voltage. In addition, the resonant operation enables all the switches and diodes to fully attain soft switching over the operating voltage range. Thus, the reverse recovery problem of the diodes and the switching loss for all switches can be eliminated.

These algorithms must ensure proper synchronization even in the case of disturbances such as voltage-sags and phase-jumps, which are common in high-voltage and low-voltage ride-through applications. Therefore, the development of robust synchronization algorithms in these situations is of interest. In this article, a nonlinear synchronization algorithm suitable for application in grid-following inverters operating under fault ride-through conditions is proposed. This algorithm is called multilevel limit cycle oscillator frequency-locked loop (MLCO-FLL), and it is used as a prefilter for a synchronous reference frame phase-locked loop (SRF-PLL). This algorithm is robust against phase-jumps and variations in the voltage, both representing important features for fault ride-through applications. Also, it automatically detects the operation at different voltage levels without state machines or logic conditions. These features might be of interest in other research fields, where the detection of orbits is important. A comparison with other linear and nonlinear synchronization algorithms showed that MLCO-FLL features important advances. Moreover, in future, it is possible to improve its performance once its characteristics and parameters are examined in detail. Simulations and experimental results obtained from a 15 kW inverter connected to a grid-emulator were used to validate the MLCO-FLL.</description></item><item><title>Three-Switching Surface Nonsingular Terminal Sliding Mode Control for Two-Phase Buck Converters with Load Variations and Uncertain System Parameters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10583941</link><description>To enhance the robustness of two-phase buck converter under load variations and uncertain system parameters, a novel voltage regulation strategy is proposed. The voltage regulation strategy consists of a three-switching surface nonsingular terminal sliding mode controller (TSSNTSMC) to regulate the output voltage and a current controller to equalize the inductor currents. Regarding the TSSNTSMC, the phase plot is divided into four regions by three switching surfaces. Depending on the region in which the sliding variable is located, the TSSNTSMC can directly determine the quantity of high-side switches to be turned on. This approach is beneficial in reducing the internal disturbances. The convergence of the designed controllers is analyzed by the Lyapunov theory. The TSSNTSMC is not affected by the current controller in terms of convergence. Simulation and experimental results show that the proposed strategy provides favorable response and disturbance rejection performance under load variations and uncertain system parameters.</description></item><item><title>Event-Triggered Secure Consensus Control for DC Microgrids Under DoS Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10586771</link><description>Distributed control strategy has been widely applied in dc microgrids for better performance, but it is susceptible to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, which can render it ineffective and impact system stability.

However, the configuration of NMGs is subject to change due to revamping, faults, or privacy issues within each microgrid (MG), and existing control mechanisms cannot realize configurable control with a privacy guarantee. To address this control problem, we offer a fresh perspective on the control framework by proposing a configurable decentralized-distributed control strategy using directed graphs with minimal communication and less privacy disclosure risk. Specifically, one distributed generator (DG) in each MG is designated as the leader to ensure complete privacy protection in a decentralized manner, eliminating the need to exchange information among other NMGs. Follower DGs communicate exclusively with their leader DGs within clusters, enhancing the control performance. Furthermore, by introducing a novel leaky integral control law, the proposed configurable control framework can adapt to different NMG configurations without redesigning controllers. The stability of the entire NMG system is analyzed rigorously. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control framework is demonstrated in solving secondary frequency restoration and active power-sharing problems of NMGs. The experimental test system is built on the OPAL-RT system, and the results show the superiority of our proposed control method under decentralized, distributed, and hybrid NMG configurations.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Wind Power Forecasting Based on the Strategy of &#8220;Dynamic Matching and Online Modeling&#8221;</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620613</link><description>Ultra-short-term wind power forecasting plays a vital role in real-time scheduling, frequency regulation, and intraday market transactions. Due to the complexity of weather systems, unit aging, wind farm control strategies, etc., the temporal dependency relationship in wind power series changes from time to time (known as concept drift), which leads to the low forecasting accuracy of the commonly used offline modeling methods. Online modeling can effectively deal with concept drift by utilizing the latest information in the flow data and capturing the latest concepts during the modeling process. However, the existing online modeling methods cannot meet the timeliness requirements of the power grid for ultra-short-term wind power forecasting. Therefore, a strategy of &#8220;dynamic matching and online modeling&#8221; for ultra-short-term wind power forecasting is proposed in this paper. Training samples are dynamically selected according to the characteristic similarity of amplitude and fluctuation, aiming to improve the representativeness of samples and reduce the training time simultaneously. In addition to historical power, Numerical Weather Prediction wind speed is also introduced in the process of &#8220;dynamic matching&#8221; to improve the forecasting accuracy. Operation data from three wind farms in China is used to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The results show that the forecasting accuracy can be improved by 1.18%&#8211;4.32% for 4 hours in advance.</description></item><item><title>Resilience-Oriented Two-Stage Restoration Considering Coordinated Maintenance and Reconfiguration in Integrated Power Distribution and Heating Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620409</link><description>The inherent linkage between a power distribution system (PDS) and a district heating system (DHS) necessitates coordinated load restoration after natural disasters. To guarantee optimal load restoration during a recovery process, a coordinated dispatch strategy of the maintenance crew for the PDS/DHS considering the optimal reconfiguration of their respective networks is proposed in this paper. The proposed solution focuses on the intricate mutual interaction of the DHS and PDS and coordinates the fault isolation and service restoration stages. The proposed optimization is modeled as a mixed-integer second-order cone problem (MISOCP), which contains numerous integer variables. To lessen the computational burden, a two-stage acceleration algorithm is proposed, which divides the solution procedure into two stages based on two types of integer variables: load status variables and variables associated with the maintenance path and network topology. Then, the acceleration principles are proposed to determine the load status variables. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model are validated by extensive cases, which demonstrate the performance of the coordinated maintenance and reconfiguration in integrated energy systems for fault recovery.</description></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Control Strategy for F-SOP Considering Three-Phase Imbalance and Economic Operation in ISLDN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638221</link><description>With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RES) and single-phase loads, three-phase imbalance and transformer lightly/heavily loaded operation issues has become more prominent in low-voltage distribution networks (LDN). However, existing research on interconnected systems of LDN (ISLDN) rarely addresses the comprehensive management of both three-phase imbalance and lightly/heavily loaded operation issues. To this end, a comprehensive control strategy for three-phase imbalance and lightly/heavily loaded operation in ISLDN based on a four-leg soft open point (F-SOP) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the comprehensive loss characteristics model of ISLDN including the F-SOP and the transformer are established, revealing that both imbalance and load rate can affect the equipment efficiency. Secondly, considering the objective of minimizing power loss, an optimization dispatch strategy with constraints of three-phase imbalance and the optimal economic operation area is proposed to obtain the dispatch power commands for the F-SOP. Furthermore, an improved peer-to-peer control for F-SOP is proposed to ensure the conduct of the optimization dispatch strategy and enhance stability performance of system. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed comprehensive control strategy are validated by the simulations and experiments. The results show that comprehensive control of lightly/heavily loaded operation and three-phase imbalance in the ISLDN can significantly reduce daily power loss by 62%, improving system operation reliability and economy.</description></item><item><title>Graph-Based Large Scale Probabilistic PV Power Forecasting Insensitive to Space-Time Missing Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643410</link><description>In recent years, power systems integrated with distributed energy resources (DERs) have been considered to mitigate climate change. However, this makes power systems even more uncertain and complex, so uncertainty-aware accurate forecasting needs to be considered for the massive penetration of renewable energy. To this end, we propose a scalable and missing-insensitive framework for probabilistic multi-site photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting, specifically focused on large-scale PV sites and space-time missing data. By leveraging the graph neural network (GNN), the proposed scalable graph learning mechanism with random coarse graph attention and probabilistic spatio-temporal learning performs efficiently for large-scale PV sites in terms of forecasting accuracy and model training complexity. At the same time, our framework adaptively imputes the missing PV data in the space and time domain, respectively. Ablation study results demonstrate that our framework is effective for extracting complex spatial-temporal features across large-scale PV sites. Under extensive experiments, our framework shows 7$-$10% and 6$-$25% improvement on average for over 1600 PV sites and three types of space-time missing data, which ensures accurate and stable forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Dispatch Strategy for a Multi-Microgrid Cooperative Alliance Using a Two-Stage Pricing Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648707</link><description>To coordinate resources among multi-level stakeholders and enhance the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into multi-microgrids, this study proposes an optimal dispatch strategy within a multi-microgrid cooperative alliance using a nuanced two-stage pricing mechanism. Initially, the strategy assesses electric energy interactions between microgrids and distribution networks to establish a foundation for collaborative scheduling. The two-stage pricing mechanism initiates with a leader-follower game, wherein the microgrid operator acts as the leader and users as followers. Subsequently, it adjusts EV tariffs based on the game's equilibrium, taking into account factors such as battery degradation and travel needs to optimize EVs' electricity consumption. Furthermore, a bi-level optimization model refines power interactions and pricing strategies across the network, significantly enhancing demand response capabilities and economic outcomes. Simulation results demonstrate that this strategy not only increases renewable energy consumption but also reduces energy costs, thereby improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of the system.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Optimization Operation of Improved Power-to-Hydrogen-and-Heat Method at Low Temperature for Reducing Carbon Emissions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654708</link><description>The power-to-hydrogen-and-heat (P2HH) method is a potential means of improving energy efficiency while reducing carbon emissions. However, existing P2HH methods are ineffective at low temperatures, and do not consider physical constraints on heat exchange between the electrolyzer and heating network. Hence, this paper proposes an improved P2HH (IP2HH) method to overcome these shortcomings. First, this paper proposes a novel collaborative mechanism between the electrolyzer and the heating network. In this system, the electrolyzer can not only transfer excess heat to the heating network when at high temperatures, but can also be heated by the heating network when at low temperatures. Second, this paper takes the physical limitations of heat exchange between electrolyzer and heating network into consideration, and models the regulating valve of heat exchanger. These considerations allow produce simulation results that better approximate real-world scenarios. Finally, a convex model integrated with the IP2HH approach is established. Compared with the existing P2HH method, the IP2HH method may allow electrolyzer to work intermittently based on fluctuations in renewables supplies while maintaining high hydrogen production efficiency. Such improvements could reduce carbon emissions by 35.5%, costs by 10.7%, and renewables curtailment by 26.4% at ambient temperature of 1 $^{\circ }$C.</description></item><item><title>Scheduling Multiple Industrial Electrolyzers in Renewable P2H Systems: A Coordinated Active-Reactive Power Management Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654460</link><description>Utility-scale renewable power-to-hydrogen (ReP2H) systems typically consist of multiple electrolyzers (ELZs), many of which are powered by thyristor rectifiers (TRs). A TR-powered ELZ has a nonlinear and nondecouplable relation between its active and reactive loads. The on-off switching and load allocation across multiple ELZs impact the efficiency of P2H energy conversion and the active and reactive power flows in the electrical network. Improper scheduling may result in an excessive reactive load from the hydrogen plant, causing voltage violations and increased network losses, which compromise both safety and profitability. To address these issues, this paper first explores the tradeoffs between the energy efficiency and reactive loads of ELZs. Then, we propose a joint active-reactive power management method to coordinate the loads and thermal properties of the ELZs, renewables, energy storage, and var compensation to improve the overall productivity and profitability. Mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) is established to achieve these goals, and a decomposition algorithm enables its applicability in large-scale systems. Case studies show that the proposed method, at best, increases the hydrogen yield by 2.49% while reducing network losses by 3.12% compared to the state-of-the-art strategies based on wind and solar power data from Inner Mongolia, China. The optimal var resource configuration for ReP2H systems is also briefly discussed.</description></item><item><title>Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Optimal Power Flow With Renewable Energy Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660524</link><description>The serious uncertainties from the extensive integration of renewable energy generations put forward a higher real-time requirement for power system dispatching. To provide economic and feasible generation operations in real-time, a physics-informed reinforcement learning (PIRL) method based on constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) for optimal power flow (OPF) is presented in this paper. In the proposed method, a physics-informed actor based on the power flow equations is designed to generate generation operations that satisfy the equality constraints of OPF. To specify inequality constraints in actor optimization, the policy gradient is augmented with the constraints to correct unfeasible generation operations. In particular, the cost functions related to inequality constraints can be directly calculated based on the output of the actor, which is more accurate than using networks to approximate in general CRL methods. The proposed method is tested on the IEEE 118-bus system, and the simulation result shows that the proposed method achieves a significant improvement in computation speed compared with the traditional interior point method while obtaining a similar generation cost.</description></item><item><title>Exploiting the Flexibility of District Heating System for Distribution System Operation: Set-Based Characterization and Temporal Decomposition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660566</link><description>The proliferation of distributed renewable resources increases the uncertainty in distribution systems. Coupling the distribution system and district heating system helps leverage the flexibility of thermal storage and thus supports the operation of the electrical grid. This paper proposes a method to characterize flexibility from district heating system via polyhedral sets. First, a recursive robust feasibility condition that ensures heat supply adequacy under uncertain demand is established. Then, stagewise robust feasible sets of thermal storage levels are calculated using a customized projection algorithm. Finally, dynamic bounds of electric heaters are computed by a further projection step. With those dynamic bounds, the electric heaters behave like reducible loads, and the demands in each period are decoupled over time, although the dispatch of thermal storage units must comply with inter-temporal constraints. The proposed method allows the two coupled systems to be operated in a distributed way without forecasts and extensive communications. Numerical simulations on small and practically sized testing systems validate the advantage of the proposed method. On average, the set calculation takes about 8 minutes for the day-ahead problem and 11 seconds for real-time dispatch on a portable laptop, and the prediction-free operation policy has an average optimality gap of 3.6% compared to the hindsight optimum.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Volt-VAR Coordinated Scheduling With Mobile Energy Storage System for Active Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10664000</link><description>In order to improve the voltage distribution and operation cost for ADN, A scheduling strategy is designed to integrate flexible resources, particularly mobile energy storage systems, within the coupling of ADN and TN, under an uncertain environment. A day-ahead Volt-VAR coordinated scheduling framework for ADN and TN can be proposed through incorporating a data-driven day-ahead scenario generation method based on denoising diffusion probabilistic model. First, the historical data may be employed to learn the error relationship between real power curves and predicted power curves for generating RES scenarios. The probability distribution for prediction error is constructed which can describe the day-ahead output power curve of RES. Subsequently, a SCCO approach is employed to measure voltage operating risk in uncertain environment, which can effectively utilize the controllability of different resource at timescale and spatial scale in ADN to fulfill the anticipated operational requirement. Finally, The ADN coupled with TN model can be linearized and converted into the mixed-integer linear programming method. Numerical simulations based on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system coupled with 15-node transportation network may verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Photovoltaic-Grid Integrated System for the Residential Power Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10663696</link><description>This paper proposes a photovoltaic (PV)-Utility integrated system with inductive power transfer (IPT) for electric vehicle (EV) charging applications in residential management applications. To realize this objective, a buck boost-interleaved H-bridge (BBIHB) configuration is proposed to integrate the PV source with the DC link of the front end converter (FEC) while achieving maximum power from the PV and power delivery to the IPT simultaneously. The DC bus of the IPT in the proposed system is obtained through the additive connection of the PV and FEC DC-link, which results in inherent boost of the DC bus voltage for the IPT system thus enhances the transmission power for the EV charging. Furthermore, the FEC allows bidirectional power flow between the utility and BBIHB converter by sharing the deficient or excess power in the system based on PV power availability. The complete modeling of the system and a control algorithm to achieve the above mentioned objectives is presented in this paper. Other features of the proposed system include inherent voltage boosting, a simple control strategy, and the absence of a separate converter for the PV to extract maximum power. Finally, an experimental hardware setup is developed in the laboratory and tested up to 4 kW of output power to validate the proposed system's performance, achieving a maximum DC-to-DC efficiency of 94% at this condition.</description></item><item><title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Dynamic Droop Control Strategy for Real-Time Optimal Operation and Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10664502</link><description>The optimal operation of an islanded AC microgrid system is achieved by proper power sharing among generators. The conventional distributed cost optimization strategies use a communication system to converge incremental costs. However, these methods are dependent on the distributed communication network and do not consider frequency deviations for real-time load variability. Thus, this paper proposes a DRL-based dynamic droop control strategy. The proposed twin delayed DDPG-based DRL interacts with the environment to learn the optimal droop gain for reducing generation cost and frequency deviation. The trained agent uses local information to transmit dynamic droop gains to the primary controller as demand load changes. It can simplify the control structure by omitting the secondary layer for optimal operation and power quality. The proposed control strategy is designed with a centralized DRL training process and distributed execution, enabling real-time distributed optimal operation. The comparison results with conventional distributed strategy confirms better control performance of the proposed strategy. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed strategy was verified by experiment on AC microgrid testbed.</description></item><item><title>Cross-Timescale Interaction Analysis Between Current Control and Rotor Speed Control Timescale Dynamics in a High-Proportion DFIG-WT System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665985</link><description>Power electronics (PE) equipment contains multiple timescale energy storage components and control loops. As a result, the dynamic process presents multiple timescale characteristics in PE-dominated power systems. For simplicity, single timescale dynamics are often the focus of corresponding analysis, and the influence of different timescales (i.e., cross-timescale analysis) is rarely considered. However, there is an interaction effect between multiple timescale controls and energy storage components, which complicates system dynamics. In this study, the cross-timescale impact of current control on the dynamics of rotor speed control timescale are evaluated. First, based on a two-machine two-area system comprising a phase-locked loop (PLL)-synchronized doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine (WT), the influence of the PLL on cross-timescale interactions is revealed via modal analysis. Then, a current control equivalent circuit is derived for analyzing its cross-timescale influence on rotor motion, and the LC resonance mechanism related to the current control is revealed. Moreover, the impact of the PLL on cross-timescale interactions is elucidated. Finally, the cross-timescale influence phenomena and mechanisms are verified via real-time digital simulations.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Prediction of Wind Farm Cluster Power Based on Embedded Graph Structure Learning With Spatiotemporal Information Gain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669105</link><description>Ultra-short-term prediction of wind farm cluster power (UPWFCP) is of great significance for the development of intra-day power generation plan, and the power prediction accuracy is difficult to be further improved due to the chaotic effect of the weather system and the incompleteness of the information. In this regard, this paper proposes an embedded graph structure learning method for wind farm cluster (WFC) that incorporates spatiotemporal information gain (STIG) theory. The graph structure describing the spatiotemporal evolution relationship of information between wind farms (WFs) is constructed based on the spatiotemporal transfer relationship of power waveforms between WFs. An embedded graph attention network (EGAN) is proposed to learn STIG adjacency relationship among WFs, and a dynamic grouping scheme of redundant nodes in WFs based on STIG distance is constructed to reduce the modeling complexity. The proposed method is applied to the WFC of Inner Mongolia, China, and the results show that the NRMSE, NMAE, and MAPE of the proposed method are on average 2.63%, 2.09%, and 20.95% lower, and the R2 and Pr are on average 7.66% and 6.64% higher, respectively, compared with the rest of the comparison methods at all time scales.</description></item><item><title>Integrating Air-Source Heat Pumps into the Demand-Side Fast Frequency Response Service: A Study Based on Thermal Dynamic Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669175</link><description>Fast frequency response services, designed to quickly balance the electrical grid within seconds, have a critical importance for managing sudden anomalies in low-inertia power systems. Battery systems often serve as versatile prosumers on the demand side to facilitate fast frequency response services. However, the nature of fast frequency response services leads to a highly fluctuating power profile for batteries, which can shorten their lifetime. In contrast, distributed air-source heat pumps in residential areas have a substantial untapped potential to support fast frequency response services. This paper seeks to integrate them into the existing services through a controller upgrade. We analyze the influence of air-source heat pumps' inherent complex thermal dynamics on fast frequency response services, revealing control challenges posed by unpredictable operating condition changes. Such a challenge is tackled with a standard droop control structure which is tuned through ${{H}_\infty }$ method, guaranteeing practical and stable operations within the permitted operating condition range. Finally, the proposed fast frequency response service scheme is tested through multiphysics simulations on a small-size low-inertia residential microgrid. The obtained results strongly supported the proposed new service.</description></item><item><title>Globally Optimal Distributed Operation of Integrated Electric and Heating Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10677480</link><description>Unit commitment (UC) is a key player in the coordinated operation of integrated energy systems. However, the participation of multiple market entities with widely different characteristics in large-scale energy systems has urged the critical need for the application of a distributed scheme to the UC problem. The NP-hard UC problem is a challenging mixed-integer programming problem. The presence of a large number of binary variables in the UC subproblems, which are solved by each participating entity after implementing the UC decomposition, fails to guarantee the convergence and the optimality of existing solution methods. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a distributed method, using logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD), for the UC problem in a typical multi-entity system, i.e., integrated electric and heating system (IEHS). By searching the branch and bound tree of the district heating system (DHS) subproblem, the lower bound of its objective function is rigorously derived as a valid Benders cut to ensure the convergence to global optimal results. This distributed method is suitable for both deterministic and robust UC solutions. Numerical simulations are conducted on two test systems to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model and its distributed solution method.</description></item><item><title>Set-Valued Regression of Wind Power Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10678875</link><description>Precise wind power curves are pivotal for monitoring the status of wind turbines and predicting wind power, which are important parts of utilizing wind energy in power systems. However, the data sets for training wind power curve models have a critical issue. A considerable proportion of the data sets is abnormal due to communication failure and other factors. Using the data sets with abnormal data will significantly deteriorate the fitting performance. This paper resolves the above issue by proposing a unified way to achieve abnormal data detection and curve fitting. Instead of regression with scalar output, set-valued regression of the wind power curve is considered, giving a set of wind power for a given wind speed. Interval neural network is adopted as the model for set-valued regression. A chance-constrained optimization problem is formulated to train an interval neural network. The obtained interval neural network can specify a subset with the normal data area, which can be used to give the threshold for abnormal data detection. Besides, the center points of the interval can be used as the fitted wind power curve. Since the formulated chance-constrained optimization problem is intractable, a sample-based sigmoidal approximation method is proposed to approximately solve it. The convergence and probabilistic feasibility of the approximation are given. Finally, experimental validations have been conducted to compare the proposed method with several existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Preserving Normal Power Curve Data With Sparse Density via Wind Speed-Power Correlation Trend Cleaning Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10678883</link><description>Stochastic wind conditions and curtailment lead to a sparse distribution of normal data compared to outliers on the Wind Power Curve (WPC). This results in the removal of sparse normal data during the data cleaning process, hampering short-term wind power assessment and forecasting. To address this issue, this paper proposes a decision boundary construction method that utilizes the wind speed-power correlation trend to retain normal WPC data. First, leveraging the positive correlation between wind speed and power, an incremental trend search strategy is used to obtain the trend curve. Building on this curve, a scatter motion trend algorithm is introduced to eliminate densely clustered curtailed power data. Finally, a kernel function-based 3-sigma boundary construction method is suggested to further reduce the influence of remaining clustered outliers on decision boundaries. The proposed method is compared to eight advanced algorithms using data from 17 wind turbines across three wind farms, demonstrating superior performance, especially in scenarios with sparse normal data.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Inertial Control for Wind Turbine Generators in Fast Frequency Response Based on the Power Reduction Period Assessment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10678806</link><description>Fast frequency response of wind turbine generators (WTGs) is achieved by injecting incremental power to the grid followed by power reductions to avoid over-deceleration and ensure secure rotor speed recovery. Second frequency deeps (SFDs) are the results of such power reductions that are challenging during abrupt frequency transients that may lead to under-frequency load shedding, or cascading events leading to blackouts. To address this issue, this paper presents an adaptive inertial control (AIC) scheme for WTGs designed to maximize the improvement in frequency nadir without causing SFD. The proposed method is developed through an assessment of power reduction period of WTGs during fast frequency response. This analysis investigates the impacts on the system frequency of a) injecting different shares of disturbance size (SoDSs) by WTGs and b) latency/delay in power injection. Derived from this analysis, the AIC is proposed to inject the maximum possible SoDS during the over-production period and successfully stabilize and recover the rotor speed during the assigned optimal power reduction period with SFDs disabled. This is achieved by adaptively adjusting the AIC in the reduction period based on the SoDS injected by WTGs during the over-production stage. Also, the AIC is modified to adapt against wind speed deviations. To evaluate the performance of the AIC, a comprehensive verification is carried out by comparing AIC with thirteen existing inertial control schemes and maximum power point tracking control in various cases using wind-integrated IEEE 39-bus system in Digsilent PowerFactory and real-time experimental tests. The results confirm the effectiveness of AIC in terms of achieving maximum improvement in frequency nadir without generating SFD.</description></item><item><title>Causal Mechanism-Enabled Zero-Label Learning for Power Generation Forecasting of Newly-Built PV Sites</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10679087</link><description>Power forecasting of newly built photovoltaic (PV) sites faces huge challenges owing to the lack of sufficient training samples. To this end, this paper proposes an unsupervised zero-label learning method for power generation forecasting of newly built PV sites without relying on any historical power output data. The main idea is to extract invariant causal structures across different PV sites and leverage this causality to enhance the power forecasting performance on the newly built ones. In particular, a causality-enabled domain adaptation network (CEDAN) is designed to capture the causal mechanism of PV generation from the multiple fine-grain segments of time-lagged data. It relaxes the causal relationships to an associative structure which is further concretized as attention score vectors through the designed intra- and inter-variable attention mechanisms. To quantify the distribution discrepancies between source and target domain causal structures, a specific domain adaptation loss function is designed for the optimization of CEDAN. It is further extended to a domain adaptation quantile loss to handle the uncertainties of PV power output. By jointly minimizing the domain adaptation loss and power forecasting error/conditional quantile loss, an invariant power generation causal mechanism across data domains for a newly built PV site can be learned. This allows the proposed method to achieve accurate and highly generalized power generation forecasting for newly built PV sites without relying on labeled data. Extensive experiments utilizing real PV generation data demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art transfer learning methods by 7.57% at least in deterministic forecasting and 8.37% at least in probabilistic forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Startup Control of Grid-Forming Offshore Wind Turbines Connected to the Diode-Rectifier-Based HVDC Link</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680154</link><description>The Diode-Rectifier (DR) based HVDC has been considered as an economical solution to connect remote offshore wind turbines (WTs) to the onshore power grid. However, the DR is a passive device and cannot support the startup of the WTs. Therefore, it is worth finding an appropriate and cost-effective startup strategy for the DR-connected WTs. This paper investigates to use of wind energy to startup those WTs to avoid the need for additional grid support or the energy storage system, which can reduce the overall cost of such transmission system. The first challenge for this strategy is that the output active power of WTs can be extremely low during the startup process, which puts the WT rotor at a high risk of overspeed. Another challenge is to prevent power surges between synchronizing WTs. To address those issues, the pitch control has been innovated for the DR-connected WTs. In addition, a seamless synchronization control of the DR-connected WTs is proposed, which does not need the phase-locked-loop and can facilitate the whole startup process of the DR-connected WTs. The feasibility of these proposed control strategies for the startup of the DR-connected WTs is verified by comprehensive simulation studies.</description></item><item><title>Reliability-Based Planning of Cable Layout for Offshore Wind Farm Electrical Collector System Considering Post-Fault Network Reconfiguration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681539</link><description>The electrical collector system (ECS) plays a crucial role in determining the performance of offshore wind farms (OWFs). Existing research has predominantly restricted ECS cable layouts to conventional radial or ring structures and employed graph theory heuristics for solutions. However, both economic efficiency and reliability of the OWFs heavily depend on their ECS structure, and the optimal ECS cable layout often deviates from typical configurations. In this context, this paper introduces a novel reliability-based ECS cable layout planning method for large-scale OWFs, employing a two-stage stochastic programming approach to address uncertainties of wind power and contingencies. To enhance reliability, the model incorporates optimal post-fault network reconfiguration strategies by adjusting wind turbine power supply paths through link cables. To tackle computation challenges arising from numerous contingency scenarios, a customized progressive contingency incorporation (CPCI) framework is developed to solve the model with higher efficiency by iteratively identifying non-trivial scenarios and solving the simplified problems. The convergence and optimality are theoretically proven. Numerical tests on several real-world OWFs validate the necessity of fully optimizing ECS structures and demonstrate the efficiency of the CPCI algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Transient Interaction Mechanism Analysis and Stability Control of Multi-Paralleled DFIG-Based WTs During Asymmetrical Grid Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681307</link><description>In this article, from the perspective of DC-link voltage (DCV) control, the transient interaction mechanism of multi-paralleled doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbines (WTs) is investigated during asymmetrical grid faults. Firstly, considering the coupling characteristics of positive and negative sequence (PNS) components and the interaction characteristics between the rotor side converter (RSC) and grid side converter (GSC), a large-signal nonlinear model of multiple-parallel DFIG-based WTs in DC-link voltage control time-scale is obtained. Furthermore, by using the energy function method, the dynamic interaction mechanism of multiple-parallel DFIG-based WTs is analyzed. The influence of different parameters on the transient characteristics of DC-link voltage is analyzed by using phase trajectory diagram. The dominant factors affecting the transient stability of the WTs and stability level of DC-link voltage are obtained.

Finally, simulation and experimental results validate the correctness of theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Reactive Power Optimization for Flexible Distribution Networks With Successive Relaxation Iteration Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682812</link><description>The flexible soft open point (SOP) connected to active distribution networks (ADNs) offers a promising manner of improving voltage and VAR control (VVC) by providing flexible power regulation. Due to the expansion of interconnective networks, the centralized optimization method has recently faced various challenges. This paper thus proposes a novel distributed coordinated reactive power optimization strategy for SOP-based multiregional ADNs based on local model decoupling and iterative interactions. By applying the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), the centralized VVC optimization problem is divided into several subproblems, allowing each area to optimize its local subproblem in a fully distributed manner. Multiple resources are thereby coordinated by the VVC, including both discrete and continuous devices. To ensure computability of both integer and non-convex problems, the relaxation iteration and successive linear approximation methods are nested to the ADMM framework, within this approach to allow ready solution to the distributed VVC optimization problem to be generated using a relaxation iterative algorithm, which significantly improves algorithm convergence and computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in this work using a modified IEEE standard interconnection system.</description></item><item><title>Fast Power Regulation Method During System Restoration for D-PMSG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10685139</link><description>The speed of the pitch action is one of the primary constraints that limit the power ramp rate of wind turbines (WTs). By storing kinetic energy (KE) within the wind wheel, blades, and generator rotor, the output power of the WT can be regulated more rapidly with less pitch action. This capability is beneficial in specific situations where additional power injection is required by the external system, such as during the system restoration process after a blackout. In this paper, a novel fast power regulation method for direct-drive PMSG-based (D-PMSG-based) WTs is proposed. This method allows for the early completion of the most time-consuming pitch reduction process and ensures that KE can be stored within the WT before the external system becomes available. As a result, the WT will be able to achieve maximum power output before the system restoration is fully completed. The potential operation boundary and the maximum external power support capability of D-PMSG-based WTs are analyzed. By following the operation boundary, converter modulation problem caused by high KE reserve can be avoided. The proposed fast power regulation method can significantly reduce the power increase speed and maximize the output power capability of D-PMSG-base WTs.</description></item><item><title>Research on PV Hosting Capacity of Distribution Networks Based on Data-Driven and Nonlinear Sensitivity Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693542</link><description>Voltage calculations are critical for assessing photovoltaic hosting capacity; however, acquiring precise parameters and the topology of the medium voltage distribution networks poses a significant challenge, thereby rendering traditional power flow computational methods ineffective.

Firstly, a deep neural network model for distribution network's power flow and voltage-power sensitivity analysis is established using historical data. This model captures the data-driven error, which reduces time consumption and increases accuracy. Secondly, a fourth-order Taylor expansion of power to voltage is derived based on the power flow mathematical equation to extrapolate voltage. This is necessary because when photovoltaic generators are connected to the nodes, the load data often exceeds the historical data range, rendering neural networks inapplicable. Finally, the sparrow search algorithm is employed to determine the hosting capacity. The proposed methods are validated using IEEE 33 and IEEE 69 case systems, demonstrating that the data-driven approach, combined with nonlinear functions, can ensure the accuracy in obtaining node voltage and the hosting capacity.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Evaluation to Power System Oscillation Damping Capability of DFIG-POD Based on Path Damping Torque Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693531</link><description>The increasing wind power decreases power system damping and may intensify low-frequency oscillation (LFO). The LFO are usually damped by the power system stabilizer (PSS) at synchronous generator (SG), and now by the power oscillation damper (POD) at doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). The existing damping torque analysis (DTA) sets the parameters of the PSS and evaluates its damping capability, but can not be applied to the POD due to the difficulty of finding the damping path related to the DFIG and the coupling between the POD and the DFIG, which are studied in this paper. At first, the analytical expression of the coupling between the POD and DFIG is newly derived with linear fractional transformation (LFT) technique. Then the path damping torque analysis (PDTA) is proposed to reconstruct the damping path of the POD. Thirdly, the damping indicator based on the return difference matrix is proposed to evaluate the contribution of damping path to the LFO. Finally, numerical results of test system are given to validate effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model, and parameter optimization to the multi-input POD (MIPOD) is performed to show the application value of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Spatiotemporal Adversarial Domain Generalization for Locating Subsynchronous Oscillation Sources Under Unseen Conditions in Large-Scale Renewable Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693450</link><description>Subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs) in renewable power systems have emerged as a major challenge, jeopardizing the stability and safety of power system operations. Thus, it is essential to accurately and timely locate SSO sources. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods for locating SSO sources have become increasingly popular, existing AI-based methods usually fail in practical applications due to unavailable or insufficient real-world SSO data for model training, and significant distribution gaps in samples under different operational conditions. They also fail to fully utilize the temporal characteristics of oscillations and the spatial topology of the system. Moreover, these methods only focus on locating either negative-damping-SSO or forced-SSO sources. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel strategy termed Spatiotemporal-Adversarial-Domain-Generalization (STADG) to locate oscillation sources in both SSO scenarios of real power systems. This method allows the model to train on multi-source domains (simplified-simulation power systems) with sufficient labeled samples, and to be directly applied to an unseen test target domain (real power system) under unknow operating conditions. The proposed approach employs a graph-attention network and a long-short-term-memory network to fully leverage spatial and temporal features of SSOs. Extensive experiments on the modified IEEE-39 and WECC-179 bus systems confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Two-Level Distributed Consensus Control of Multiple Wind Farms for Fast Frequency Support</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10694712</link><description>The neighboring wind farms have great frequency support potential. The wind turbine generators (WTGs) in these wind farms are influenced by wake effects and have different frequency support capabilities. In order to fully utilize the WTGs' support capabilities under different operating states, this paper proposes a two-level distributed consensus (TLDC) control to cooperate all the WTGs. Level I is leader-follower control, which is equipped within the wind farms. Level II is leaderless control which is used among the wind farms. This method is able to assign different values of power commands to different WTGs in the system to achieve better frequency support effect and stability. Based on MATLAB/Simulink and Opal-RT real-time simulation platforms, the two-area power system and Guangshui system (100% renewable energy power system) are analyzed, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed TLDC method has a better effect compared with other frequency support methods. It can also flexibly respond to communication interruptions and delays.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Stage Integrated Transmission and Distribution Expansion Planning Under Uncertainties With Smart Investment Options</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10694803</link><description>The shift towards a decentralized paradigm in power systems in response to decarbonization and deregulation efforts necessitates stronger coordination between transmission and distribution operators for cost-effective operation and planning. However, long-term uncertainties in the transition to net-zero are posing major challenges for decision-making. Moreover, literature has traditionally focused on the transmission and distribution expansion planning problems independently, as is customary in industry, leading to a lack of sophisticated integrated planning methods and inefficient expansion decisions in practice. This paper proposes a novel multi-stage stochastic programming framework for the integrated transmission and active distribution networks expansion planning under multi-dimensional uncertainties. Infrastructure investments are co-optimized with non-network alternatives with diverse techno-economic characteristics to support flexible planning. To manage the increased computational complexities, a machine learning-assisted multi-cut Benders decomposition approach is implemented. The case studies firstly highlight the strategic and economic advantages of the proposed multi-stage formulation, and then demonstrate the significant role and value of smart investment options in managing uncertainty. Lastly, the application of the proposed model on a study involving a 229-bus test system and 18 long-term scenarios validates its scalability and practical applicability.</description></item><item><title>Interaction Modeling and Stability Analysis of Grid-Forming Energy Storage System Based on SISO Transfer Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10700987</link><description>With the rapid expansion of photovoltaic (PV), grid-forming energy storage systems (GFM-ESS) have been widely employed for inertia response and voltage support to enhance the dynamic characteristics. Converters with different synchronization methods represent significant differences in dynamic behavior. The interactions between grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) devices with multi-time scale control may lead to small-signal instability in hybrid systems. This paper investigates a grid-connected system comprising a grid-forming energy storage system and a grid-following PV system (GFL-PV). Based on single-input-single-output (SISO) transfer functions, a dynamic interaction model for the PV-ESS system is established. Combining the open-loop transfer functions of full-loop and sub-loop, the proposed model reveals how GFM-ESS modifies the dynamic characteristics of GFL-PV under weak grid conditions. Subsequently, the impact of different control loops and parameters on the small-signal stability of the system is analyzed. The stability margins of both devices are also compared through the SISO model. Electromagnetic transient simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink and experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed models and analyses.</description></item><item><title>Impedance Characteristic Analysis and Phase-Locked Angle Feedforward-Based Stability Improvement for LCC-HVDC in Sending AC Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10704965</link><description>With the increasing penetration of wind power, the line-commutated converter-based high-voltage direct-current (LCC-HVDC) system in sending AC grid faces a potential risk of sub/super-synchronous oscillations (SSSOs), which threatens the stability of the power system. The impedance-based method is an effective way to analyze and suppress the SSSOs. However, since the effects of each control part in LCC-HVDC on the stability of sending AC grid are not yet well-investigated, there is a lack of theoretical guidance for implementing the impedance reshaping strategy for LCC-HVDC. Therefore, this paper establishes and analyzes the modular impedance model of LCC-HVDC, to elucidate the contribution of each control part and the interaction between different control loops. On this basis, an impedance reshaping strategy based on phase-locked angle feedforward (PAF) is proposed to improve system stability by attenuating the interaction. Compared to the existing virtual impedance-based method, the proposed PAF-based method addresses its possible failure in suppressing the SSSOs of sending AC grid. The theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the aforementioned conclusions and the effectiveness of the proposed impedance reshaping strategy.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Operation Flexibility in Modular Power to Hydrogen Based Ammonia Industries</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10706701</link><description>Modularization of Hydrogen Electrolyzers (HEs) is projected to be immediate, resilient, and efficient for load management in large-scale Hydrogen Consuming Industries (HCIs). It offers a scalable and flexible solution that can adapt to changes in hydrogen and power system demands. However, Modular HEs are studied primarily as small-scale wind hydrogen systems only, converting excess Renewable Energy (RE) into hydrogen without the integration of rigid downstream operations. Downstream constraints in HCIs, like rigid hydrogen demands, device operational/ramping limits, and storage constraints, can limit or regulate modular HE's use for power system services. Furthermore, oversimplified HE operational modeling within HCIs leads to suboptimal outcomes for integrated modular HCI and RE-rich power system (RPS) operations, resulting in RE curtailments and inaccurate flexibility estimations. This happens due to improper loading rates arising from unrealistic inter and intra-modular HE operations. This work proposes a comprehensive model for modular HE management in integrated ammonia (HCI) and power systems for flexibility in sector-coupled scenarios. The work considers and demonstrates how downstream constraints regulate HEs flexibility through a unit commitment problem framework. HE operations with detailed and extended electrochemical dynamics are considered to improve and enhance operational flexibility calculations of growing RPS-based modular HCIs. This allows for better sectoral integration and estimation of power system services.</description></item><item><title>An Overvoltage-Averse Model for Renewable-Rich AC/DC Distribution Networks Considering the Sensitivity of Voltage Violation Probability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709908</link><description>The increasing renewable generation increase the probability of voltage violation. The spatial and temporal power transfer can be achieved in AC/DC distribution networks based on voltage source converters (VSCs) and energy storage (ES), which can effectively avoid system voltage violation. However, the existing voltage violation mitigation methods in uncertain scenarios are either limited by the long solution time or complex modeling, which are difficult to meet the overvoltage probability reduction requirements of intra-day dispatch. In addition, the power transfer will simultaneously affect interconnected systems because the power is coupled through the VSCs. Overvoltage probability reduction on one line may lead to an increase on the other. This paper proposes a two-stage overvoltage-averse model considering the sensitivity of voltage violation probability. The proposed method analytically depicts the impact of power adjustment on the system overvoltage probability. The day-ahead optimization model is established as chance-constrained model. The intra-day optimization model is established as a quadratic convex model, which can be efficiently solved. Simulation results verify that the method proposed can effectively achieve the overvoltage probability reduction of renewable-rich AC/DC distribution networks.</description></item><item><title>A Mimicking-Avoiding Short-Term Probabilistic Power Forecasting Method for Wave Energies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709879</link><description>Wave energy is essential for sustainable marine development. However, complex marine weather conditions cause fluctuating wave power outputs, resulting in a mimicking phenomenon in predictions. Moreover, the lack of accurate numerical weather prediction (NWP) data sources aggravates the prediction inaccuracy. To address these obstacles, a series characteristic perception (SCP) method coordinated with an advanced hybrid model, the quantile liberty loss gated recurrent unit kernel density estimation (QLB-GRU-KDE), is proposed for the floating point absorber wave energy system. In the first stage, the SCP method gains prior knowledge via ensemble approaches. In the second stage, a liberty loss function is used to mitigate the mimicking phenomenon. Furthermore, a hybrid model that integrates a GRU and KDE is adopted for the probabilistic forecasting of wave energy generation. In addition, a metric is proposed to evaluate the severity of the mimicking. A case study based on a real-world wave dataset is conducted, where both deterministic and probabilistic prediction approaches are examined. Comparisons with the cutting-edge counterparts reveal that the designed liberty loss effectively mitigates the mimicking issue. The comprehensive performance of the proposed model, including the accuracy, stability, reliability and sharpness in wave power prediction, is validated by multiple metrics.</description></item><item><title>Approximate Optimal Energy Management of Thermal-HESS System for MIMO Fuzzy Logic Controller Based AGC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10710156</link><description>Compared to one-type of energy storage device, hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) offer benefits for Auto generation control (AGC) command tracking and can reduce investment in energy storage. Traditional control method, although effective in meeting the matching of AGC commands at a specific moment, often lacks coordination across multiple time intervals, resulting in frequent and irregular charging/ discharging which reduces the overall lifetime. To address this, this paper presents an approximate optimal operation strategy for Thermal-HESS system, aiming to enhance the AGC performance of the generating unit and improve the energy management capability of the HESSs. Firstly, an auto-adjust Markov Chain prediction method is proposed to forecast the power demand of the AGC command tracking to determine power demand's tendency. Secondly, a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC)-based optimal model, which considers the current step and cost-to-go function, is proposed. However, the SMPC based model is multiple-step optimal operational problem, which will increase the computational burden of the controller. Therefore, this paper further designs a Multiple-Input-Multiple-output (MIMO) fuzzy logic controller to approximate the optimal alternative to the cost-to-go function of SMPC model, meeting the computational and application requirements more effectively. Finally, numerical case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in AGC command tracking and HESSs energy management.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Resilience of Urban Electric-Road-Metro Interdependent Network Considering Electric Bus Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10711253</link><description>With the increasing electrification of urban transportation, urban power and traffic systems are highly coupled and influence each other, leading to a challenge for the post-event resilience enhancement of urban electric-traffic interdependent network (ETIN). In this context, we propose a multi-layer electric-metro-road interdependent network where the metro network (MN) depends on the distribution power network (DPN) and interacts with the road traffic network (RTN) synchronously. Electric buses (EBs), as one public dispatchable resource, are considered and explored to provide bridging routes for disabled MNs and supply power for failed DPNs, with consideration of three different service trips, i.e., the original trip, bridging trip, and charge-discharge trip. On this basis, a spatio-temporal network-based EB route schedule model is constructed. To consider the evacuation demand of affected MN routes, a fast DPN restoration strategy is proposed to minimize the time cost of lost load by integrating the network reconfiguration with the collaborative allocation of repair crews (RCs) and EBs. Finally, a distributed method is further devised for the coordination among different stakeholders. The proposed method is verified on two electric-traffic systems to show that the collaborative scheduling of RCs and EBs can effectively enhance the resilience of ETIN under metro service disruptions.</description></item><item><title>An Integrated Sparse Gated Graph Density Network Based on Transfer Learning for Multi-Site Probabilistic Forecasting of Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10714034</link><description>Large-scale new energy grid-connected poses significant challenges to the safe and efficient operation of smart grids. Renewable energy probabilistic forecasting (REPF) technology can analyze uncertainties in power generation, quantitatively balance risks, and prevent the breakdown of the grid. However, current REPF methods reliant on spatio-temporal maps fail to accurately estimate the probability density function (PDF) of renewable energy, resulting lacking comprehensive uncertainty analysis for distributed power generation systems (DPGS). To fill this gap, in this study, an integrated sparse gated graph density network (ISGGDN) that incorporates transfer learning to tackle the REPF challenge. A sparse gated graph dynamic convolutional network based on cross attention and residual connection is developed, which can effectively extract spatial features and spatio-temporal interactions between sites and improve the accuracy of probabilistic prediction. Furthermore, to effectively identify the types of features lost during the transfer process and to enhance the transfer learning (TL) capability, we developed an integrated approach involving multiple fine-tuning strategies based on TL. We evaluated the proposed model using wind and photovoltaic (PV) power generation data from two neighboring multi-sites, and the experimental results demonstrate that ISGGDN outperforms other existing solutions in terms of accuracy and effectiveness in REPF.</description></item><item><title>Aggregating Large-Scale Residential Users for Regulation Reserve Provision: Truthful Combinatorial Auction Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715698</link><description>The proliferation of flexible loads has empowered residential users in contributing both upward and downward frequency regulation reserves to the power grid. Due to barriers like minimum bid size, residential users with relatively small power consumption must be aggregated before they can enter the reserve market. However, the large number of residential users renders the aggregation mechanism design problem a challenging task. In particular, the cost for reserve provision of each user is not only highly heterogeneous, but also coupled through both the temporal dimension and the up/down regulation direction. In order to allow the users to fully express their costs, in this paper, we propose a combinatorial reverse auction (CRA) framework as the market mechanism for user aggregation. In this auction, the aggregator is the auctioneer and procures reserves from residential users. The users submit package bids consisting of combinations of both upward and downward reserves over multiple time-slots, capturing the coupling in the user cost. Furthermore, to address the infamous computational challenges of large-scale combinatorial auctions, we develop a novel fast combinatorial auction (FCA) mechanism that can be solved in polynomial time. It includes an approximate winner determination algorithm and a critical payment scheme. Notably, our proposed mechanism is rigorously proved to possess desirable economic properties such as truthfulness and individual rationality. Extensive simulations have validated the theoretic properties of the proposed CRA mechanism and its advantages over existing methods. In particular, compared with the widely employed truthful Vickery-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, CRA can be $10^{4}$ times faster than VCG when the user number is above 1000. Meanwhile, it is able to achieve near-optimal social cost, where the average optimality loss is 2.92%.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Planning for Stability Enhancement in High IBR-Penetrated Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10716464</link><description>Security and stability challenges in future power systems with high penetration Inverter-Based Resources (IBR) have been anticipated as one of the main barriers to decarbonization. Grid-following IBRs may become unstable under small disturbances in weak grids, while during transient processes, system stability and protection may be jeopardized due to the lack of sufficient Short-Circuit Current (SCC). To solve these challenges and achieve decarbonization, the future system has to be carefully planned. However, it remains unclear how both small-signal and transient stabilities can be considered during the system planning stage. In this context, this paper proposes a coordinated planning model of different resources in the transmission system, namely the synchronous condensers and GFM IBRs to enhance system stability. The system strength and SCC constraints are analytically derived by considering the different characteristics of synchronous units and IBRs, which are further effectively linearized through a novel data-driven approach, where an active sampling method is proposed to generate a representative data set. The significant economic value of the proposed coordinated planning framework in both system asset investment and system operation is demonstrated through detailed case studies.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Swing PLL Synchronization Transient Stability of Grid-Connected Paralleled Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10720168</link><description>During grid faults, the grid-connected paralleled converter systems is susceptible to a phase-locked loop (PLL) synchronization transient instability. Most existing studies focus on first-swing transient stability analysis using the equal-area criterion. However, achieving first-swing transient stability does not guarantee overall stability, as the system may still experience multi-swing transient instability. This paper analyzes the type of multi-swing transient instability issue from two aspects: transient instability mechanism and transient stability assessment. Firstly, the mechanism of multi-swing transient instability is revealed from the transient energy conversion point of view. Then, considering transient interactions between converters, the largest estimated domain of attraction (LEDA) is constructed utilizing the Takagi-Sugeno method. Using the LEDA, the multi-swing transient instability problem of the grid-connected paralleled converter systems is quantitatively analyzed. Finally, the theoretical results are verified based on the RT-LAB hardware-in-the-loop experimental platform.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Planning of Multi-Microgrid System With Shared Energy Storage Based on Capacity Leasing and Energy Sharing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660302</link><description>Microgrids (MGs) are important forms of supporting the efficient utilization of distributed renewable energy resources (RES). To achieve high proportion penetration of distributed RES and improve the system efficiency, this paper focuses on the multi-microgrid (MMG) system with shared energy storage (SES) and an optimal planning method of MMG system with capacity leasing and energy sharing for PV carrying capability enhancement is proposed. Firstly, a collaborative optimization framework between the multi-microgrid operator (MMGO) and the shared energy storage operator (SESO) is proposed. Secondly, the PV carrying capability index is proposed from two dimensions: the hosting capability and the accommodation capability, and the capacity planning model of the MMG system considering PV carrying capability index is established. Then, the capacity leasing and energy sharing model among MGs as well as between MMG systems and SES system is established. Based on this, a collaborative capacity planning model of MMGO and SESO with the Nash Bargaining game is developed and a distributed solution algorithm is designed. Finally, through a comprehensive case study we can draw that, the proposed planning method with capacity leasing and energy sharing can enhance PV carrying capability of the MMG system while improving economics of MMGO and SESO.</description></item><item><title>Enabling High-Efficiency Economic Dispatch of Hybrid AC/DC Networked Microgrids: Steady-State Convex Bi-Directional Converter Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666856</link><description>The use of bi-directional converters (BDCs) is crucial for enhancing power exchange in hybrid AC/DC networked microgrids (NMGs). However, the dynamic nature of their conversion efficiency and the non-convex conversion direction expression of BDC models result in a highly non-convex programming problem, which leads to significant computational challenges. This paper proposes a least squares approximation approach to simplify the complex trigonometric function that characterizes the dynamic changes in BDC conversion efficiency with power. The simplified expression transforms the original non-convex relationship into a computationally efficient convex form. Subsequently, we systematically explore and validate the sufficient conditions to achieve non-simultaneous rectification and inversion behaviors of BDCs in a convex form. These explored conditions are further customized and extended to various practical application scenarios. Case studies are conducted on a hybrid AC/DC NMG with 66 nodes. The results demonstrate that our proposed least squares approximation method transforms the computationally intractable model into one that is solvable. Additionally, the explored conditions contribute to a substantial reduction in solution time by more than two orders of magnitude. These results verify the superiority of our proposed method, and showcase its applicability in practical scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Incipient Fault Detection of Medium-Voltage Distribution Cable Systems Using Time-Frequency Analysis of Grounding Wire Currents</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637287</link><description>Incipient cable faults pose a significant risk to the normal operation of power grids. Addressing the issue of detecting incipient faults in underground cables is particularly difficult due to their hidden external characteristics that are not easily observable. Furthermore, these faults occur randomly, with short durations, which further complicates their detection. This paper firstly establishes a cable field-circuit equivalent model that considers multi-conductor electromagnetic coupling for incipient faulty scenarios. The mathematical relationship between the grounding wire currents (GWCs) and fault conditions is then theoretically deduced specifically. A novel method is developed to detect incipient faults in three-core cables by analyzing the time-frequency characteristics of GWC frequency components considering the time-varying fault resistance. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method, showing little impact from fault initial conditions, disturbances, and distributed generations (DGs). Finally, the method is verified in an actual 10 kV distribution network.</description></item><item><title>Tensor Convolution-Based Aggregated Flexibility Estimation in Active Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10663439</link><description>Power system operators require advanced applications in the control centers to tackle increasingly variable power transfers effectively. One urgently needed application concerns estimating the feasible available aggregated flexibility from a power system network, which can be effectively deployed to mitigate issues in interconnected networks. This paper proposes the TensorConvolution+ algorithm to address the above application. Unlike related literature approaches, TensorConvolution+ estimates the density of feasible flexibility combinations to reach a new operating point within the p-q flexibility area. This density can improve the decision-making of system operators for efficient and safe flexibility deployment. The proposed algorithm applies to radial and meshed networks, is adaptable to new operational conditions, and can consider scenarios with disconnected flexibility areas. Using convolutions and tensors, the algorithm efficiently aggregates the combinations of flexibility providers&#8217; adjustable power output that can occur for each flexibility area set point. Simulations on the meshed Oberrhein and radial CIGRE test networks illustrate the effectiveness of TensorConvolution+ for flexibility estimation with high numerical confidence and a minor computing effort. Additional simulations highlight how system operators can interpret the estimated density of feasible flexibility combinations for decision-making purposes, the algorithm&#8217;s capability to estimate disconnected flexibility areas, and adapt to new operating conditions.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Coordinated Scheduling of Port Integrated Energy System and Bulk Terminal With Two-Tier Incentives</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637267</link><description>Given the increasing energy interconnection and coupling between port integrated energy system (PIES) and bulk terminal, this paper proposes a coordinated scheduling strategy to realize the potential of their coordination to improve energy efficiency and operational benefits of PIES. First, a coordination framework of energy system operators (ESO), logistics system operators (LSO), and infrastructure operators (IO) with two-tier incentives (TTI) is constructed to enable LSO and IO to coordinate ESO to cope with demand response incentives (DRI) set by the power grid. By analyzing the operating load characteristics of facilities in bidirectional bulk cargo logistics (BBCL) and the energy use comfort characteristics of infrastructure loads at bulk terminal, the scheduling models of ESO, LSO, and IO are then constructed. A mixed-integer two-level optimization model based on analytical target cascading (ATC) is developed to realize a decentralized autonomy and coordinated solution of the scheduling models. And an efficient LSO scheduling based on parallel machine scheduling (PMS) is built to further improve the solution efficiency of the optimization model. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy to improve the economic benefits of each operator and increase the energy efficiency of PIES.</description></item><item><title>Stochastic-Robust Planning of Networked Hydrogen-Electrical Microgrids: A Study on Induced Refueling Demand</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659235</link><description>Hydrogen-electrical microgrids are increasingly assuming an important role on the pathway toward decarbonization of energy and transportation systems. This paper studies networked hydrogen-electrical microgrids planning (NHEMP), considering a critical but often-overlooked issue, i.e., the demand-inducing effect (DIE) associated with infrastructure development decisions. Specifically, higher refueling capacities will attract more refueling demand of hydrogen-powered vehicles (HVs). To capture such interactions between investment decisions and induced refueling demand, we introduce a decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) set and build a trilevel stochastic-robust formulation. The upper-level determines optimal investment strategies for hydrogen-electrical microgrids, the lower-level optimizes the risk-aware operation schedules across a series of stochastic scenarios, and, for each scenario, the middle-level identifies the &#8220;worst&#8221; situation of refueling demand within an individual DDU set to ensure economic feasibility. Then, an adaptive and exact decomposition algorithm, based on Parametric Column-and-Constraint Generation (PC&amp;amp;CG), is customized and developed to address the computational challenge and to quantitatively analyze the impact of DIE. Case studies on an IEEE exemplary system validate the effectiveness of the proposed NHEMP model and the PC&amp;amp;CG algorithm. It is worth highlighting that DIE can make an important contribution to the economic benefits of NHEMP, yet its significance will gradually decrease when the main bottleneck transits to other system restrictions.</description></item><item><title>Asynchronous Communication-Based Distributed Control Strategy for ON/OFF State Thermostatically Controlled Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10636803</link><description>Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) obtain significant potential for providing auxiliary services to the power grid. Aggregators typically utilize centralized strategies when implementing direct load control (DLC) to manage TCLs, but these strategies consume substantial communication resources when dealing with large-scale TCLs. This paper proposes a distributed control strategy for ON/OFF state TCLs to alleviate the aggregator&#8217;s communication burden. The concept of temperature-based priority is introduced to ensure fair scheduling among TCLs. TCLs can determine their priority order in the cluster by communicating with neighboring TCLs and locally decide their operation states to achieve reference power tracking. A sub-priorities splitting method is introduced to further enhance power tracking accuracy. Furthermore, the proposed strategy utilizes an asynchronous communication mechanism in the coordination process, making it highly suitable for practical implementation. The study conducts numerical simulations and semi-physical experiments to validate the practical feasibility of the proposed strategy. The results conclusively demonstrate that the proposed strategy can effectively achieve accurate reference power tracking by the TCLs cluster.</description></item><item><title>Coordinative Operating Strategy of Grid-Interactive FTPSS-HST for Cost-Efficient Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10640147</link><description>The expansion of high-speed railways (HSR) has led to a surge in railway electricity demand, especially in Europe and East Asia. To address this issue, traction-power-supply systems (TPSS) that consist entirely of railway loads, are being upgraded to flexible-TPSSs (FTPSS) that incorporate distributed energy resources (DER). Since high-speed trains (HSTs) have the potential to enhance the system flexibility by utilizing their controllable power, integrating HSTs and FTPSS presents an opportunity to further improve the system economy and flexibility. In this paper, FTPSS and HSTs are integrated to form a grid-interactive railway power system for the first time. Further, the coordinative operation including trajectory control of HST and energy management of FTPSS is proposed. To improve the cost-efficiency rate, a microscopic kinetic-electric model of HST is established to characterize its energy conversion process and dynamic power. Additionally, the time-domain model of the system is transformed into the space-domain model using state transformation according to HST displacement. On this basis, the hp-adaptive spatial-pseudospectral method is developed. This method can capture the spatiotemporal conditions of the power and railway systems and is suitable for the operating characteristics of HST. The real-data simulation verifies that the proposed method significantly improves the economic benefits of HSR operation under grid interactive operation.</description></item><item><title>Source-Load Collaborative Frequency Control With Real-Time Optimality in Power Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666801</link><description>With the increasing uncertainties on both supply and demand sides, how to improve the performance of the current multiple time-scales frequency control architecture is the main focus of this study. Inspired by reverse- and forward-engineering, we propose a novel frequency control scheme based on existing distributed control mechanisms to restore the frequency after disturbances while achieving global economic efficiency. We bridge the time gap between conventional secondary frequency control and economic dispatch. On the load side, after showing that the physical network dynamics can solve well-defined optimal load control problems, we develop a fully decentralized frequency controller that realizes system-wide economic objectives solely based on local measurement. On the generation side, we design a distributed control mechanism so that each bus can automatically track the most economically efficient operating points while realizing frequency recovery. A substitution method is proposed to remove disturbances from the update procedure of auxiliary variables. We characterize the equilibrium and establish the asymptotical convergence of the overall system based on optimization techniques. Finally, a numerical test is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Approach for Modeling Spatial and Temporal Correlations of PV Generation Applied to Prosumer Virtual Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10640112</link><description>Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) play a crucial role in the increasing grid and market integration of distributed energy resources. However, as VPP complexity and geographic scale increase, the variable nature of PV generation makes accurate prediction of the VPP aggregate output challenging. The problem is further exacerbated by the paucity of smart meter data, making some prosumers unobservable to the VPP aggregator. To address these challenges, we propose a Bayesian Vector Autoregression approach to quantify the generation variance of a VPP consisting of an aggregation of residential rooftop PV systems spread over a large geographical area. The key idea is to generate synthetic data for unobserved prosumers using observed prosumers&#8217; local correlation microstructure and temporal cross-correlation, allowing the simulation of the VPP output. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach by using two different Australian data sets. We study two use cases, considering the impact of the level of prosumer observability and the VPP size on the variance of the aggregate VPP output. Compared to the existing approaches, the proposed nonparametric approach provides a more accurate forecast of VPP output variance, allowing the VPP operator to manage market risk better.</description></item><item><title>Supply Resilience Constrained Scheduling of MEGs for Distribution System Restoration: A Stochastic Model and FW-PH Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643213</link><description>Mobile emergency generators (MEGs) are critical resources for distribution system restoration after disaster- induced outages. However, insufficient fuel storage can cause MEGs to cease operation, leading to secondary interruptions of restored services. To enhance supply resilience, we include fuel tank (FT) dispatch as part of the MEG-aid restoration strategy. An integrated sequential service restoration model is developed to optimize the spatiotemporal travel behavior of MEGs and FTs, restoration paths, and load pickup sequences in the distribution network. To account for uncertain distribution line faults and traffic congestion, a stochastic programming approach is used. The proposed method optimally prepositions MEGs and routes them to target locations to restore critical loads by gradually forming microgrids. Moreover, the FTs in the transportation network are scheduled to ensure adequate fuel for the uninterrupted and reliable operation of MEGs. The presence of both uncertainty and discreteness presents computational challenges to the stochastic mixed-integer programming model. Thus, a distributed algorithm that combines the progressive hedging and Frank-Wolfe methods is applied to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring global convergence. Simulation results showed the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the reliability of restoration schemes and computational efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Research on Active Protection Method for Microgrids Based on Harmonic Injection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10663462</link><description>With the increasing penetration of inverter interfaced distributed generators (IIDGs) in microgrids, traditional protection schemes are difficult to cope with the complexities of microgrids. Harmonic-injected protection schemes based on power electronic devices can simplify the harmonic component equivalent network of the microgrid into a single-source radial structure. However, the performance of these schemes is degraded by the shunt effect of the non-harmonic injection source IIDGs and the utility grid. This paper focuses on the active protection method for microgrids based on harmonic injection. A fault control strategy based on harmonic current control and principles for PCC filter parameter design are proposed to address the shunt effect. With the proposed strategy, harmonic currents of varying frequencies are injected into the microgrid by the IIDGs, and the major portion of the injected harmonic currents can flow to the fault point. By analyzing the fault characteristics, a fault location method based on harmonic injection is proposed. Finally, simulation analysis is carried out on MATLAB/Simulink platform, and the effectiveness of the proposed active protection scheme is verified by the results.</description></item><item><title>Small-Sample Event Identification Based on Adaptive Second-Order MDF and Triplet CNNs Using Distribution-Level Synchronized Measurements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666857</link><description>Distribution-level synchronized measurements serve as a valuable resource for event-type identification. The precision in identifying events offers crucial information for fault analysis, asset monitoring, state estimation, and ensuring the reliability of power delivery. Currently, a major issue in the event identification task arises from the scarcity and imbalance of event samples, attributed to the brief installation period of the distribution-level synchrophasor measurement system. To address this, a novel few-shot learning event identification method is proposed in this paper. The Adaptive Second-order Motif Difference Field (A2-MDF) is developed for feature transformation, which allows extracting higher-order patterns and structural information from time series data into images to extract fused features at different time scales. A dual strategy involving sample enhancement through Data Augmented Generative Adversarial Networks (DA-GAN) and sample balancing via Random Under Sampling (RUS) is also developed to mitigate the issues associated with sample scarcity and imbalance across different event types. Finally, a triplet network employing three Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is proposed for classification in small-sample scenarios. Results using both simulation and field data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method with limited labelled data.</description></item><item><title>Fog-Computing-Based Joint Flow Calculation Method of Coupled Power and Transportation Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634988</link><description>In recent years, the rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) has led to frequent interactions and tight coupling of the power distribution network (PDN) and transportation network (TN). To effectively analyze the dynamic interactions between PDN and TN, this paper proposes a joint traffic-power flow calculation method using a fog computing architecture, which combines macroscopic traffic flows with microscopic individual vehicle characteristics, improving the link transmission model to describe the dynamic traffic transmission among links in TN and between charging stations (CSs) and TN, as well as the dynamic charging and queuing process of EVs at CSs. Moreover, this paper develops a travel time estimation model and an energy consumption estimation model for EVs, effectively describing the dynamic power transmission among EVs, CSs, and PDN. Numerical results show that the method can effectively capture the spatio-temporal interactions among PDN, TN, CSs, and EVs, even under system incidents. The scalability and computational efficiency of this method are demonstrated through testing on a large-scale coupled network.</description></item><item><title>Developing a Security Metric for Assessing the Power Grid&#8217;s Posture Against Attacks From EV Charging Ecosystem</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10664647</link><description>Providing reliable and efficient services for EV users necessitates the use of cyber layers on top of physical layers in EV ecosystems. The deployment of such cyber layers, however, makes these ecosystems an appealing target for various cyber-attacks&#8212;e.g., data manipulation, malware injection, and intrusions&#8212;which are crafted to deteriorate the operation of power distribution networks. On this basis, this paper develops a metric that captures the security posture of EV ecosystems, considering the possible attacks and their associated impacts on distribution grids. First, potential attack graphs are obtained to show the connections between the adversaries&#8217; access points and the consequences of attack vectors. Then, a Markov decision process (MDP) tree is generated, using probabilities of adversaries&#8217; success rates for a specific attack vector and unique reward functions. The developed MDP tree is then resolved by a policy iteration algorithm to calculate the value function of each state, related subsequent adversarial actions from the attackers&#8217; viewpoint, and quantify the security posture of each state. Finally, using the obtained metric, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained offline to notify the distribution system operators (DSOs) of the security status of EV ecosystems, i.e., secure and alarm situations. DSOs can use the developed security metrics to design consequent corrective actions during critical cyber attacks. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed security metric in quantifying the security status of the grid, a cyber-physical testbed is built. This testbed integrates a virtual sphere (vSphere) to simulate the cyber parts of the EV ecosystem as well as a real-time simulator to model two distribution networks, i.e., IEEE 33- and 141-bus, under DSO control center based on IEC 61850. For a distribution network with dynamic sections that can be created using the operation of tie-switches, a supplementary strategy has also been suggested. This strategy is evaluated under the IEEE 69-bus distribution network to calculate the related security metric and update the security monitoring framework.</description></item><item><title>Power Line Monitoring-Based Consensus Algorithm for Performance Enhancement of Energy Blockchain Applications in Smart Grid 2.0</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643430</link><description>Energy blockchain applications are becoming inevitable with the transformation of electricity distribution networks into the decentralized Smart Grid 2.0 architecture. The scalability of the blockchain platform plays a key role in catering to the increasing number of nodes connected due to consumer-turned-prosumers being integrated into the distribution grid in a distributed manner. Hence, this study aims to optimize blockchain utilization for Smart Grid 2.0 applications through a novel consensus mechanism, which eliminates the requirement for performing additional complex computations to mine a new block. The algorithm utilizes the grid monitoring process through the existing smart meters, and thus has been capable of reducing the energy footprint for block mining to a fraction of that of the legacy Proof-of-Work algorithm, and reducing the block creation time by  $\sim \lt 60\%$ . The proposed Power Line Monitoring-based Consensus Mechanism (PLMC) algorithm is validated using the Process Analysis Toolkit (PAT). In addition, data collected while monitoring the network for block mining is utilized for power quality measurement purposes.</description></item><item><title>Network Sustainability Enhancement Through Optimal Fairness Management for Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659185</link><description>In a prosumer rich environment, most of the peers are likely to be equipped with distributed resources based facilities, this results in network sustainability enhancement if the fairness of energy trading be optimally managed through the network. Developing a decentralized energy pricing methodology while considering the proper arrangement of the network is inevitable. This paper proposes a new approach for conducting effective negotiations between peers in a novel peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture to contrive a fair energy trading mechanism by enhancing the authority of benefiting the grid for all peers through their transactions. The proposed methodology increases the market participants&#8217; welfare as well as improves the system&#8217;s operational conditions and derives a dynamic network usage price (NUP) in contrast to conventional P2P and available works. Also, fairness in energy trading is developed here for P2P trading by addressing the derived network utilization welfare function in which those transactions that impose negative impacts on the network condition are effectively prevented to enhance the fairness of the grid without sacrificing accessibility to generation for demands. Requiring low computational burdens as well as low information exchange are other innovations that are achieved by implementing the proposed algorithms. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed approach are verified by means of extensive simulation studies and the obtained results show fast convergence, scalability, readily implemented, and guaranteeing maximum peer&#8217;s welfare as well as optimal network fairness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>DST-GNN: A Dynamic Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network for Cyberattack Detection in Grid-Tied Photovoltaic Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638139</link><description>The increasing deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in the electric grid, aimed at addressing the energy crisis and surging power demands, has expanded the potential vulnerability to cyberattacks due to the inter-networking of the grid-connected power electronics converters. In this paper, we propose a dynamic spatiotemporal graph neural network (DST-GNN) for cyberattack detection in grid-tied PV systems. Specifically, to exploit the inherent graph topology of the grid-tied PV system, we start by employing a GNN with a dynamic weighted adjacency matrix to capture the latent spatial correlations within signal data. Then, a one-dimensional convolution neural network (1D-CNN) is utilized to extract the underlying temporal patterns. Notably, we leverage the system dynamics to determine the dynamic graph weights and the number of graph convolution layers, while the hyper-parameters of 1D-CNN are designed based on the periodicity of input signals. Finally, the integration of the priori physical system knowledge further enhances the interpretability and improves the detection performance of DST-GNN. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that embeds the grid-tied PV system into a graph structure for cyberattack detection. The effectiveness of DST-GNN is evaluated through comprehensive case studies on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) grid-tied PV testbed, and numerical results demonstrate its superiority over baseline methods.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Power Flow Analysis via Secure Multi-Party Computation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10667665</link><description>Smart grids feature a bidirectional flow of electricity and data, enhancing flexibility, efficiency, and reliability in increasingly volatile energy grids. However, data from smart meters can reveal sensitive private information. Consequently, the adoption of smart meters is often restricted via legal means and hampered by limited user acceptance. Since metering data is beneficial for fault-free grid operation, power management, and resource allocation, applying privacy-preserving techniques to smart metering data is an important research problem. This work addresses this by using secure multi-party computation (SMPC), allowing multiple parties to jointly evaluate functions of their private inputs without revealing the latter. Concretely, we show how to perform power flow analysis on cryptographically hidden prosumer data. More precisely, we present a tailored solution to the power flow problem building on an SMPC implementation of Newton&#8217;s method. We analyze the security of our approach in the universal composability framework and provide benchmarks for various grid types, threat models, and solvers. Our results indicate that secure multi-party computation can be able to alleviate privacy issues in smart grids in certain applications.</description></item><item><title>Decision-Oriented Modeling of Thermal Dynamics Within Buildings</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638763</link><description>To enhance the quality of energy management tasks, accurately representing the thermal dynamics of buildings is crucial. Traditional methods aim to improve the building model in regards to an arbitrary statistical metric, before feeding the trained model to the optimization-based energy management process. In this paper, we advocate for a more integrated approach, consisting of incorporating the downstream optimization directly into the training pipeline. The goal is to improve the building model in strategic operating zones, where the greatest impact on decision-making will be achieved. To that end, we first formulate the thermal dynamics as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using neural networks. The model parameters are then updated through an end-to-end gradient-based training strategy wherein the downstream optimization is used as the loss function. To increase the robustness of the approach, the proposed loss is combined with traditional physics-informed accuracy-oriented training, employing a novel coordinated gradient descent algorithm. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed modeling method, regarding both the optimality of decisions and their physical interpretability.</description></item><item><title>Seamless and Multi-Resolution Energy Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643199</link><description>Forecasting is pivotal in energy systems, by providing fundamentals for operation at different horizons and resolutions. Though energy forecasting has been widely studied for capturing temporal information, very few works concentrate on the frequency information provided by forecasts. They are consequently often limited to single-resolution applications (e.g., hourly). Here, we propose a unified energy forecasting framework based on Laplace transform in the multi-resolution context. The forecasts can be seamlessly produced at different desired resolutions without re-training or post-processing. Case studies on both energy demand and supply data show that the forecasts from our proposed method can provide accurate information in both time and frequency domains. Across the resolutions, the forecasts also demonstrate high consistency. More importantly, we explore the operational effects of our produced forecasts in the day-ahead and intra-day energy scheduling. The relationship between (i) errors in both time and frequency domains and (ii) operational value of the forecasts is analyzed. Significant operational benefits are obtained.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Transient Dynamics Stabilization in Islanded Microgrids Through Adaptive and Hierarchical Data-Driven Predictive Droop Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665992</link><description>The transient dynamics of microgrids is primarily impacted by low-inertia power electronic interfaces, energy generation of distributed energy resources (DERs), load demand fluctuations, and the control strategies employed for system integration. This paper focuses on the enhancement of the transient dynamics to achieve a stable steady-state operation for the microgrid by minimizing the overall islanded system&#8217;s frequency deviations. A modularized physics-informed sparse identification technique is developed for system identification that can accurately predict the future states of the microgrid with interconnected DERs. The data-driven prediction model is then incorporated into the model predictive control framework to generate an optimal control input that can augment with conventional droop control for frequency stabilization. Given the inherent fluctuations in typical microgrid operations, stemming from factors such as varying load demands, weather conditions, and other variables, reachability analysis is also performed in this work. By doing so, we aim to facilitate the design of data-driven models and implement effective control strategies for microgrids subject to disturbances, and thus, ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of microgrids across a wide range of operating conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is verified in this paper with numerical examples where the developed controller is tested in various worst-case scenarios generated by the reachable set computation.</description></item><item><title>Deciding When to Use a Personalized Model for Load Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10644149</link><description>Load forecasting plays a vital role in achieving supply-demand balance in power systems and lays the foundation for economic dispatch, demand response, etc. Conventionally, a global forecasting model will be constructed for the whole dataset. The problem of non-independently and identically distributed (non-i.i.d) data causes performance degradation of the global model. Many studies suggest building personalized models to account for heterogeneous distributions. However, there lacks a discussion about how much benefit can be achieved by the personalization over the global model and when it is necessary to conduct the personalization. To this end, we investigate when to use a personalized model for load forecasting. To answer this question, we first compare the generalization bound of the personalized model to the global model, demonstrating the potential for personalization to enhance performance. Then, we propose a Cluster-Oriented Representations Encoder (CORE) model to map the input feature space into representation space with clustering structure. The mixture distributions of the global dataset can be recognized to construct sub-representation datasets to lay the foundation for personalization. Subsequently, we quantify the personalization gain achieved by fine-tuning the global model with mathematical derivation. Finally, we decide whether to use the personalized model at each timestep and develop an adaptive personalization strategy for load forecasting. Comprehensive case studies have been carried out to validate the efficacy of the proposed adaptive personalization strategy in both single-load and multi-load forecasting and demonstrate the necessity to balance the global and personalized modeling approaches.</description></item><item><title>Improving Model Generalization for Short-Term Customer Load Forecasting With Causal Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660529</link><description>Short-term customer load forecasting is vital for the normal operation of power systems. Unfortunately, conventional machine learning-based forecasting methods are susceptible to generalization issues (e.g., the customer heterogeneity and distribution drift of load data), manifested in model performance degradation. In recent years, some studies have employed the advanced deep learning technology, such as online learning, to overcome the aforesaid problems. However, these methods can only alleviate the adverse impacts of generalization problems on model performance, because they are inherently built on unstable relationships (i.e., correlations). In this paper, we propose a novel causal inference-based method to improve the generalization for short-term customer load forecasting models. Specifically, we first investigate the causal relations between input features and the output in existing methods, and introduce the load characteristics as an extra model input to enhance the causality. Then, we closely inspect the causality in models by using the causal graph to distinguish the confounder, followed by employing the causal intervention with do-calculus to eliminate the spurious correlations caused by the confounder. Moreover, we propose a novel load forecasting framework with the load characteristic extraction, characteristic pool approximation and characteristic-injected model to realize the causal intervention in an efficient and fidelity way. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method are validated on a public dataset.</description></item><item><title>A Large Language Model for Determining Partial Tripping of Distributed Energy Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10675341</link><description>Knowing the status of individual distributed energy resources, i.e., being tripped or not, after a contingency can inform the development of an aggregated DER model.

Herein, the realistic functional Vulnerability Index (VI) is originally determined based on a modified algorithm based on DCOPF with practical assumptions regarding load shedding and controllability, which is time-consuming as expected. For this modified functional VI, the supply-demand imbalances and line overloading situations are distinguished considering the urgency of their required corrective actions affecting the consequences of uncontrollability. Moreover, focused on both accuracy and evaluation time, a new topological VA framework is developed emphasizing the electrical properties of the power systems in the VI calculation, especially the adequacy. The proposed topological VA framework consists of four simple calculation criteria, avoiding complex optimization problems while checking the network&#8217;s capability to handle both over and under-frequency cases based on available generation reserve and load flexibility. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed schemes have been validated based on the simulation results of the IEEE 39-bus system. The proposed topological method reduces the computation burden by 60% while having over 99% accuracy compared to the modified functional framework.</description></item><item><title>Electrical Circuit Analogy-Based Maximum Latency Calculation Method of Internet Data Centers in Power-Communication Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10714408</link><description>This letter has developed an electrical circuit analogy-based maximum latency calculation (MLC) method of the Internet data center (IDC) in power-communication network.

However, the increase in essential supporting Electric Vehicle Supply Equipments (EVSEs) has led to a large and diverse cryptographic demand for charging aggregators. The growing demand for computational power cannot be met by local cryptographic computing clusters, while cryptographic computing services on the cloud bring risks such as cross-VM (cross-Virtual-Machine) attacks. Meeting the requirements of security and timeliness simultaneously poses challenges for cryptographic service architecture and scheduling algorithms. To address these challenges, a heterogeneous task processing architecture is proposed to integrate local and cloud computing resources. Next, a task queue is constructed to transform the dynamic scheduling problem of multiple cryptographic tasks into a queue-jumping sequential decision-making problem. By modeling security requirements as constraints, the problem is modeled as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) formulation. A Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method with recurrent networks and a safe action mechanism are proposed to solve the formulation, which utilizes the temporal characteristics of cryptographic tasks to achieve better scheduling performance under constraints. Finally, compared with the state-of-the-art method, our proposed approach is validated through simulation experiments, demonstrating superior security and enhanced processing efficiency across various scenarios.</description></item><item><title>A Probabilistic Graphical Model for Predicting Cascade Failures of Electric Vehicle Charging Networks Caused by Hurricanes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10679196</link><description>Electric vehicle charging networks (EVCNs) are vulnerable to power outages. The resilience of critical charging infrastructures is vital for providing uninterrupted service. When a hurricane occurs, the offline charging stations (CSs) may cause the redistribution of EV traffic flow, resulting in the congestion at the healthy CSs and potentially leading to a cascade failure. This paper presents a probabilistic graphical modeling (PGM) framework for predicting the hurricane-induced cascading failures of EVCNs. A Bayesian network is proposed to capture the relationships between a hurricane, the power and traffic systems coupled by an EVCN. An AC-based Cascading Failure model (ACCF) is established to simulate the line overloading and load shedding. EV load redistribution is formulated as a traffic assignment problem considering the road impedance between the nearby CSs. The proposed PGM is trained by the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm considering the traffic flow as the hidden variable. Clique tree method is used to infer the propagation probability of cascading failure. The case study demonstrates the causal relationship between hazards and cascading failures of EVCNs under different hurricane scenarios. Results show that the proposed method can predict the propagation of cascading failures in EVCNs by identifying and quantifying the correlation among the susceptible CSs.</description></item><item><title>Co-Optimizing Power-Transportation Networks With Circulating Loads and Particle-Like Stochastic Motion</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10679187</link><description>Coupling power-transportation systems may enhance the resilience of power grids by engaging energy-carrying mobile entities such as electric vehicles (EVs), truck-mounted energy storage systems, and Data Centers (DCs), which can shift the computing loads among their network. In practice, the co-optimization problem for power-transportation systems can be overly complicated due to a great deal of uncertainty and many decision variables rooted in the EV population and mobile energy storage. Another challenge is the heterogeneity in terms of size and supporting capability due to various types of such mobile entities. This work aims to facilitate power-transportation co-optimization by proposing and formalizing the concept of Circulating Loads (CirLoads) to generalize these spatial-temporal dispatchable entities. With the new concept, the stochastic process of CirLoads&#8217; movement is introduced using Brownian particles for the first time. Such novel particle motion-based modeling for EVs can reflect their stochastic behaviors over time without requiring exact data of EVs. The distributions of CirLoads are further aggregated with Gaussian Mixture Models to reduce the dimensions. Based on this aggregated model, a co-optimization framework is proposed to coordinate the bulk of EVs while respecting data privacy between transportation and power systems. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed and Game-Theoretic-Based EV Charging Pricing Model Under Coupled Energy-Transportation-Information Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680115</link><description>Optimized charging prices for the electric vehicles (EVs) under the coupled energy, transportation and information networks architecture is helpful to dig out the spatiotemporal flexibility potential of EVs and benefit the coupled networks in return. However, most existing studies scarcely investigated the whole process of optimized EV charging pricing issues under the coupled networks architecture. To this end, our main purpose in this study is to carry out an applicable architecture, design a sustainable business model for the EV charging related entities and optimize the EV charging prices. Firstly, an architecture and business model of the EV charging related entities is established, which reflects the energy, information and money flow among these entities. Secondly, a two-stage and distributed optimal charging pricing model is proposed for EV charging station (EVCS) based on game theory, taking the TAP-UE model into consideration. Lastly, the formulated pricing model is solved by the classical Gauss-Seidel algorithm. The proposed pricing model has been verified by the IEEE 33-node distribution system and a 12-node transportation network using the real-world data, the results showing that the utilization rate of distribution network assets is balanced, and the traffic congestion issue mitigated while the utility of EVs satisfied.</description></item><item><title>Highway Service Area Multi-Timescale Optimization Scheduling Considering the Spatiotemporal Dynamic Evolution of Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634981</link><description>With the increasing demand for long-distance travel of electric vehicles (EVs), the uncertain fast charging behavior of EVs poses great pressure on the energy system of highway service areas (HSAs). The development of information and communication technology provides new insights for promoting advance perception and coordinated optimization among various entities. In this context, this paper proposes an HSA multi-timescale optimization scheduling strategy considering the spatiotemporal dynamic evolution of EVs. Firstly, the information exchange structure among various functional departments of the highway is formulated, and the highway topology model and spatiotemporal extended EV model are established as the basis for EV charging selection and EV load prediction. Then, a multi-timescale scheduling strategy suitable for multi-energy systems in HSAs is proposed to support the economic and self-sustained operation of the system. The chance-constrained method in the day-ahead stage and the two-layer model predictive control (MPC) method in the intraday and real-time stages are employed to mitigate fluctuations in power generation and demand. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is widely validated through simulations, the results indicate that the proposed EV evolution method can effectively predict the EV load, and the scheduling strategy can ensure the economy and reliability for the operation of HSA energy system.</description></item><item><title>Battery Health-Informed and Policy-Aware Deep Reinforcement Learning for EV-Facilitated Distribution Grid Optimal Policy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680085</link><description>Electric vehicles play a crucial role in modern active distribution system operation, owing to their flexibility and mobility. The joint optimization of power grid operation and EV scheduling is expected to achieve better decision-making for both power and transportation systems. However, such joint optimization can suffer from high computational complexity and a lack of information about the other system. One possible approach for the power system operator is to assume the charging/discharging pattern of the EV population and make dispatch decisions based on such estimated EV profiles. This practice results in grid-level policies. The problem arises as whether the EV population complies with and fulfills the grid-level policies is not easy to monitor. To address this issue, we further investigate and expand upon the innovative concept of grid facilitation for electric vehicles (EVs). A newly designed probabilistic incentive signal is introduced to assist in implementing grid policies. Correspondingly, we develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for EV prosumer scheduling that effectively balances EV autonomy with the execution of grid policies. Cast as a demand response signal, the grid-level policy is capable of managing overall grid operation with the facilitation of individuals and decoupling the co-optimization of the operator and EV owner. For the DRL of the EV, the training reward considers both the EV operation cost and the grid facilitation incentive, featuring a dynamically shrinking EV battery&#8217;s feasible operation range in terms of voltages and currents, and the health-informed reward. The policy-aware reward utilizes the Jensen-Shannon divergence to quantify the gap between the actual EV power injection pattern and the system operator&#8217;s assumption. Invalid action mask tricks are integrated to prevent infeasible actions for EVs. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the facilitation effect of EV on system operation planning.</description></item><item><title>Operational Economics of Renewable Energy-Hydrogen System With Hydrogen-Powered Transportation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693480</link><description>Green hydrogen, produced from renewable energy sources, is undergoing a global resurgence as a clean energy solution driving decarbonization and fueling sustainable mobility.

However, working hydraulic system of existing electric wheel loaders are centralized load-sensing (LS) system. The LS system suffers from low energy efficiency because of valve throttling losses. Therefore, an independent electro-hydraulic variable speed drive (VSD) with separate layout, normal pump speed and closed circuit is proposed to increase the efficiency of working hydraulic system and electric wheel loader. The VSD is powered by a variable-speed electric motor and a fixed pump without throttle control valve, eliminating throttling losses. Besides, the separate VSD utilizes commercially available electric motor and pump, interconnecting actuator via hydraulic pipelines. The system components are modeled in detail and the influence of pipeline is considered in simulation analysis. A mode-based control strategy for the proposed powertrain is developed. The simulation study is carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposed separate design and control strategy. The powertrain operation and energy comparison between proposed powertrain and baseline powertrain are conducted. Results demonstrate the efficiency of independent electro-hydraulic variable speed drive improves from 36.9% to 70.6% compared to centralized LS system. Furthermore, the proposed powertrain reduces energy consumption by 32.3% compared with baseline powertrain.</description></item><item><title>Electromagnetic Localization and Tracking Control of Underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicle for Subsea Cable Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645344</link><description>Subsea cables are important channels for international interconnection and power transmission. Traditional subsea cable operation and maintenance approaches rely on underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). This method is time-consuming, labour-intensive, and uneconomical due to insufficient autonomy and strong dependence on surface ship auxiliary. This paper proposes an intelligent detection scheme for simultaneous electromagnetic localization and autonomous tracking of subsea cables based on an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) equipped with an electromagnetic system. The dual triaxial electromagnetic array carried by AUV is designed to calculate the spatial location of the subsea cable. The localization results are used to design the AUV tracking guidance law, and the underactuation problem is solved. At the AUV kinetic level, the command filter and adaptive neural network are designed to solve the constraints of electromagnetic noise, unknown dynamic parameters and complex ocean current interferences. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed autonomous detection and tracking control scheme for subsea cables are verified by comparative simulation studies.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Agent Framework for P2P Energy Trading With EV Aggregators Supporting V2X Services</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654511</link><description>The number of electric vehicles (EVs) has multiplied rapidly due to governments' push towards clean energy transition. Being an integral part of future transportation-power coupling, how to make the most of these EVs in this interdependent interaction while respecting their privacy concerning EV batteries' state conditions and physical limits becomes critical. This paper proposes a new peer-to-peer energy trading framework between EV aggregators and local entities with distributed energy resources. The framework enables the efficient use of EV batteries for various vehicle-to-everything (V2X) operations, like vehicle-to-grid and vehicle-to-vehicle, while ensuring safe operation and protection of confidential data. Safe operating envelopes are developed to control EV battery state of charge and temperature limits, reducing dimensionality without compromising accuracy and privacy. Additionally, an incentive model is introduced to capture the EV owner's willingness to support V2X and undergo multiple charge/discharge cycles during the trading period. Moreover, a model predictive control-based architecture is developed to effectively manage the dynamic nature of EV arrivals and departures. The proposed peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading framework incorporates grid constraints and has been rigorously evaluated through numerical simulations conducted using the IEEE 33-bus distribution network with 5 prosumer agents, hosting a combination of solar PVs and multiple EVs. Simulation results show that the framework facilitates efficient engagement of EVs in P2P energy trading without violating their safe operational limits as well as the grid constraints.</description></item><item><title>A Soft-Switched Three-Phase Inductor Coupling Quasi-Z-Source Integrated Charger With Reduced Output Current Ripple for Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10661226</link><description>This paper proposes a three-phase inductor coupling quasi-Z-source integrated charger (qZIC) to realize zero current switching (ZCS) and zero voltage switching (ZVS) operation with low current ripple. The conventional qZIC, applying a modified modulation based on modified ZSVM3 (three-segment Z-source Space Vector Modulation), has been proposed due to its capability to achieve fully soft switching without any additional circuits. However, the inductor operates with discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), resulting in significant output charging current ripple. To figure it out, the proposed qZIC substitutes a coupled inductor for the two inductors of quasi-Z-source network. The output current is continuous and ripples are suppressed. In addition, all power switches can still realize ZVS or ZCS by designing the coupled inductor according to the operation principle. The operation principle is analyzed in detail and design considerations are provided. A 6-kW prototype is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed inductor coupling qZIC. Experimental results demonstrate the elimination of output current ripples, and all switches operate with soft switching.</description></item><item><title>IRS-Enabled Monostatic Backscatter MIMO Communication Design for V2I Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643685</link><description>Future vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) wireless networks are meeting unprecedented challenges regarding the high energy consumption problem caused by the large number of radio frequency (RF) emitters deployed. The backscatter communication (BackCom) and Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) techniques can achieve low-power transmission while implementing effective beamforming. Thus, this paper leverages these two techniques into V2I communication systems, where multiple IRSs transmit roadside information to a multi-antenna vehicle by backscattering the vehicle's signals. Considering the self-interference and two optimization methods at the vehicle, i.e., post-detection (PD) and integrated detection (ID), we formulate two weighted sum-rate maximization problems. The detection matrix and transmit power at the vehicle, as well as the IRS reflection coefficients, are jointly designed based on an alternating algorithm. The simulation results validate the convergence performance of the proposed algorithm, the feasibility of the introduced system model, and the effectiveness of the optimization scheme.</description></item><item><title>Secrecy Capacity Analysis of 4-WFRFT Based Physical Layer Security in MIMO System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10652904</link><description>In this paper, the integration of antenna selection(AS) and 4-weighted-type fractional Fourier transform (4-WFRFT) technologies into the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system based channel correlation has been proposed to enhance the security performance of wireless communications, where the energy of transmitting signals is split into four portions by employing the 4-WFRFT technology. This is equivalent to introducing additional artificial noise at the eavesdropper. To characterize system performance, the channel correlation is first considered, then we propose a valid method to model the distribution of composite instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of eavesdropper as the tractable exponential distribution. Furthermore, we drive the close-form expressions for both the joint probability density function (PDF) of channel and the average SNR at the eavesdropper. Based on above results, we deduce the close-form expressions of average security capacity with AS and 4-WFRFT technologies. To obtain further insights, we also derive the theoretical expressions of secrecy outage probability. The analysis results show that AS and 4-WFRFT technologies exist to simultaneously increase the average security capacity and then decrease the secrecy outage probability. The numerical results illustrate that: 1) 4-WFRF technology can validly eliminate the impact of channel correlation due to introducing the artificial noise; 2) the secrecy performance of system can be improved remarkably by employing AS and 4-WFRFT technologies.</description></item><item><title>Human-Assisted Resilient Coordination for Automated Platoon With False Data Injection Attack</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648953</link><description>This paper investigates the resilient platooning problem of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) under false-data injection (FDI) attacks. These attacks can alter the system state of any vehicle within a platoon at any time, presenting a significant challenge. To tackle this, we introduce a human-assisted resilient coordination (HARC) approach for CAVs, comprised of three core modules: a joint attack detection mechanism, a human-assisted coordination scheme, and a distributed optimization-based control module. The attack detection approach monitors vehicles at two distinct levels - local communication and global communication. Our human-assisted coordination strategy is designed not only to respond efficiently to attacks but also to ensure seamless coordination of the vehicle platoon, thereby preventing accidents and enhancing flexibility. By incorporating human input, we bolster the resilience and security of platoon coordination. Moreover, we present a distributed optimization-based control technique tailored specifically for constrained CAVs. A resilience constraint is designed and incorporated into the optimization problem, thereby empowering CAVs to identify adversarial communication channels via a localized communication detector. We provide experimental results to showcase the effectiveness of our proposed approach and to highlight its implications for resilient platooning under FDI attacks.</description></item><item><title>FSO-Based HAP-Assisted Multi-UAV Backhauling Over $\mathcal {F}$ Channels With Imperfect CSI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645309</link><description>Non-terrestrial Network (NTN), utilizing high-altitude platforms (HAP)-based free-space optical (FSO) backhaul and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) for last-mile access, is a feasible and promising architecture to achieve high data rate and seamless network coverage in the future 6G era. Effective resource allocation emerges as a pivotal concern for such networks. This paper addresses the data allocation issue for FSO backhaul from the HAP to multiple UAV-mounted base stations (BSs) under the constraints of ground users' requested data rates. We introduce frame allocation schemes (FAS), including rate adaptation with constraints (RAC)- and rate/power adaptation (RPA)-aided FAS. The key idea of these schemes is to allocate data frames effectively based on UAV's turbulence channel conditions, which aims to (i) guarantee the quality of services (QoS), (ii) retain both latency and throughput fairness, and (iii) minimize the transmitted power. Furthermore, the performance of these schemes is also analyzed under the impact of imperfect channel state information (CSI). We newly derive the channel probability density function (PDF) and the cumulative density function (CDF), considering the imperfect CSI due to channel estimation and quantization errors. Capitalizing on the derived PDF and CDF, different performance metrics are analytically obtained, incorporating combined effects of cloud coverage, transceiver misalignment, Fisher-Snedecor $\mathcal {F}$ turbulence, and angle-of-arrival (AoA) fluctuations. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our design proposals over the state-of-the-art. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are employed to validate the analysis.</description></item><item><title>Energy Minimization for UAV-Enabled Data Collection With Guaranteed Performance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654581</link><description>Due to their mobility, flexibility, and access to remote areas, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a versatile solution for various wireless communication applications. In this paper, we consider a UAV-enabled wireless communication system where a rotary-wing UAV is dispatched as the mobile data collector for multiple sensor nodes (SNs). Our objective is to minimize the total energy consumption of the UAV by jointly optimizing the mission completion time, UAV trajectory, and communication scheduling of the SNs. This will be achieved while ensuring that the minimum throughput requirements of all SNs involved in the system are satisfied. It has been demonstrated that the formulated problem exhibits non-convexity, compounded by the uncertainty in mission completion time. Therefore, current convex optimization techniques or traditional time discretization methods are insufficient for effectively addressing this problem. To tackle this challenge, we first propose a fly-hover-fly scheme that leverages the UAVs ability to swiftly move between points of interest and maintain stationary positions for data collection. We introduce a well-designed hovering location selection algorithm to ensure coverage of all SNs while minimizing the number of required hovering locations. As a result, the original problem is segmented into several tractable subproblems. Leveraging the fly-hover-fly trajectory solution, we further develop a waypoint adjustment scheme that progressively refines the UAVs hovering locations through successive convex approximation technique. The validity of our proposed solution is verified through in-depth numerical simulations.</description></item><item><title>Primal-Dual Deep Reinforcement Learning for Periodic Coverage-Assisted UAV Secure Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654565</link><description>Considering the UAVs' energy constraints and green communication requirements, this paper proposes a periodic coverage-assisted UAV secure communication system to maximize the worst-case average achievable secrecy rate.UAV base stations serve legitimate users while UAV jammers periodically dispatch interference signals to eavesdroppers. User scheduling, UAV trajectory and power allocation are modeled as a constrained Markov decision problem with coverage evaluation constraint. Then, the joint optimization of user scheduling, UAV trajectory and power allocation is achieved by the primal-dual soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm. Specifically, the reward critic network assesses the secrecy rate and the cost critic network fits the coverage constraint. Meanwhile, the actor network generates the user scheduling, UAV trajectory and power allocation policy while updating the dual variables. For comparison, we also adopt other deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solutions namely the SAC algorithm and the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) as well as the traditional random method and greedy method. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs best in the training speed, the reward performance and the secrecy rate.</description></item><item><title>Accelerating Maximum-Likelihood Detection in Massive MIMO: A New Paradigm With Memristor Crossbar Based In-Memory Computing Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10738291</link><description>Massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) signal processing algorithms heavily rely on high-dimension matrix operations, which impose excessively high computational complexity. Moreover, in the post-Moore era, the performance of the classical von Neumann computing architecture is facing severe limitations. The memristor crossbar based in-memory computing holds the potential to break the memory wall and enhance the circuit's energy efficiency by orders-of-magnitude. In this paper we present a memristor crossbar based circuit design for performing the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) MIMO detection with high computation parallelism at the base station equipped with a large-scale antenna array. Simulation results show that, despite considering the circuit programming error and the memristor bit-precision, the bit error rate (BER) of the proposed circuit is almost the same as that achieved by the digital computer. Moreover, the proposed circuit achieves roughly the same level of computing performance as the NVIDIA QUADRO GV100, but with about 40 times higher energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>One-Bit PMCW Radar: Designing Binary Transmit Code and Receive Filter via a Worst-Case Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648744</link><description>Phase-modulated continuous-wave (PMCW) radar is one of the emerging technologies in various wide-band applications, such as automotive radars. Utilizing a one-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) at the receiver side can reduce the cost and power consumption of this kind of radar while leveraging its benefits. In this correspondence, we consider the joint design of the binary transmit code and the receive filter for PMCW radars in the presence of a one-bit ADC at the receiver. When using a one-bit ADC, noise samples play an essential role in the sidelobe increment of the filter output. Therefore, the mean-integrated sidelobe level (MEISL) metric is used as the design criterion to cover the effect of noise. Since the target backscattering coefficient ($\alpha$) is unknown at the design stage, we resort to the worst-case approach concerning the target backscattering coefficient and cast a minimax problem. We demonstrate that the inner maximization problem has a closed-form solution. Indeed, we prove that the maximum value of MEISL for the fixed code and filter occurs at a real-valued $\alpha$ that relates to the minimum acceptable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the radar system. Finally, by recasting the objective function, a cyclic optimization procedure is utilized, for which the filter optimization subproblem has a closed-form solution, and the code is optimized using the coordinate descent framework. Several numerical examples are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed design procedure. The proposed method exhibits superior performance compared to some state-of-the-art methods, particularly in low-SNR scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Design of a New CIM-DCSK-Based Ambient Backscatter Communication System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643386</link><description>To improve the energy efficiency and the data rate in differential chaos shift keying (DCSK) based ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) system, we propose a new AmBC system based on code index modulation (CIM), referred to as CIM-DCSK-AmBC system. In the proposed system, the CIM-DCSK signal transmitted in the direct link is used as the radio frequency source of the backscatter link. The signal format in the backscatter link is designed to increase the data rate as well as eliminate the interference of the direct link signal. As such, the direct link signal and the backscatter link signal can be received and demodulated simultaneously. Moreover, we derive and validate the analytical bit error rate (BER) expressions of the CIM-DCSK-AmBC system over cascaded multipath Rayleigh fading channels. Regarding the short reference DCSK-based AmBC (SR-DCSK-AmBC) system as a benchmark system, numerical results reveal that the CIM-DCSK-AmBC system can achieve better BER performance in the direct link and higher throughput in the backscatter link than the benchmark system.</description></item><item><title>Towards High Energy Efficiency for Cell-Free Massive MIMO: A Low-Complexity Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645316</link><description>In this correspondence, we investigate the energy efficiency (EE) of the uplink in a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system equipped with low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Under the assumption of phase-unaware Ricean fading channels, we derive closed-form expressions for both the achievable rate and EE. Subsequently, we formulate an optimization problem aimed at maximizing EE through the joint design of receiver weights and power control factors. To tackle this non-convex challenge, the alternating optimization method is employed, facilitating the development of low-complexity, closed-form algorithms. These algorithms leverage the generalized eigenvalue, quadratic transformation, and Lagrangian dual transformation techniques. Our numerical results corroborate the theoretical analysis and underscore the efficacy of the proposed EE optimization algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Recent Developments of Charge Transporting Layers for High-Performance Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746558</link><description>The monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (PSTSCs) with high performance and low costs bring a new dawn to the photovoltaic industry. The unprecedented rapid growth of the power conversion efficiency for perovskite/silicon tandem devices has been accompanied by a continuous refinement of suitable materials for charge-selective contacts. Herein, we reviewed the recent studies about the monolithic PSTSCs, emphasizing on the current developments of charge carrier transporting layers over the last years. The potential and merits of new charge transporting materials have been summarized, followed by a short discussion on each part. Self-assembled monolayers present the most evocative prospect by measuring performance experimentally. Based on this kind of materials, the efficiency of tandem solar cells has risen to above 30% with texture surface and other strategies.

However, the energy-industry systems of the Americas are largely lagging as fossil fuels still dominate the electricity generation mix and the system as a whole. Energy-industry transition pathways are developed for all countries of the Americas reaching 100% renewable energy (RE) by 2050 for all energy and industry sectors. To benchmark the transition to 100% RE, the results are compared to current energy policies across the Americas, representing business-as-usual (BAU) conditions. The results indicate the significant potential to expand RE, especially solar PV, to reach the 100% RE target and fully defossilize each region's economy. The levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) can be reduced from its current level of 71 &#8364;/MWh to 24 &#8364;/MWh in 2050, and the levelized cost of final energy (LCOFE) sees reductions from 49 to 40 &#8364;/MWh from 2020 to 2050. Conversely, under BAU conditions, the LCOE only sees moderate reductions to 43 &#8364;/MWh in 2050, and the LCOFE remains relatively stable at 39 &#8364;/MWh in 2050. Widespread electrification across energy-industry sectors requires significant expansion of solar PV, which accounts for 78% of all electricity supply, leading to 14.8 TW of installed capacity. Furthermore, e-hydrogen for e-fuels and e-chemicals leads to an electrolyser capacity of 4.3 TWel. The dominating role of solar PV thus indicates that the future Americas energy-industry system can be characterized as a Solar-to-X Economy.</description></item><item><title>Comparison of Commercial TOPCon PV Modules in Accelerated Aging Tests</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746853</link><description>Tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) is set to become the new mainstream cell technology despite pending reliability concerns. This work compares commercially available TOPCon photovoltaic (PV) module types from five different manufacturers in a variety of electrical characterization and accelerated aging tests. This case study represents a selection process of PV modules for larger PV installations. Therefore, the work features an in-depth comparison of the electrical performance (energy rating) that can serve as a reference for state-of-the-art TOPCon modules. The aging results confirm previously reported degradation mechanisms of the TOPCon technology due to humidity ingress. In the case of UV aging, a new pattern of strong degradation (up to &#8211;12% after 60 kWh/m2;) and subsequent recovery after humidity freeze test is presented, which could have implications on the results of certification tests (IEC61730-2, Sequence B). Though not directly connected to the TOPCon cell technology, the mechanical load tests revealed weaknesses of several module types, related to module dimensions, frame height, and glass properties. Based on the results, the necessity for more focused testing and technological development is highlighted.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing the Cost- and Time-Effectiveness of Field PV Module Inspection by UV-Fluorescence Imaging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10755961</link><description>This case study highlights the potential of UV fluorescence imaging as an emerging photovoltaic (PV) module inspection tool allowing the cost and time of the field inspection to be considerably reduced and opening a gateway to high-throughput operation. The application of UV fluorescence imaging is advanced beyond its reported capabilities by combining this technique with near-infrared absorption spectroscopy and electrical measurements. This combined approach allows for the identification and assessment of polymer backsheets and encapsulants, i.e., detection of polymer-related features (e.g., degradation, corrosion) as well as other anomalies (e.g., cell cracks and hot cells) with otherwise inaccessible cost- and time-effectiveness. In particular, 1890 PV modules in a 2 MWp PV power station show critical issues, including inner backsheet cracks and an insulation resistance below 1 M&#937; identified for 40% of inspected strings and assigned to specific backsheet type populations. With an average throughput of 400&#8211;500 modules per hour, the present approach demonstrates a large potential for acceleration and cost-reduction of the PV plant inspection. It provides significant insights into system performance enabling proactive operation and maintenance of PV systems.</description></item><item><title>High-Quality PEI/Ag/PEI-Zn Semitransparent Electrode for Efficient ITO-Free Flexible Organic Solar Cells and Perovskite Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750454</link><description>To achieve significant advancements in flexible organic and perovskite solar cells, it is imperative to develop a flexible semitransparent electrode that possesses higher light transmittance, lower square resistance, and a flexible bending quality. In this research, we propose a high-quality flexible polyethyleneimine (PEI)/Ag/PEI-Zn electrode on common polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) flexible substrates to enhance the transmittance of conventional Ag ultrathin film electrodes in the visible wavelength range. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of flexible OSC devices based on Poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo [1,2-b:4,5-b']dithiophene)-co-(1,3-di(5-thienyl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhex yl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c']dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T-SF): IT-4F active layer achieves an optimal performance by annealing the PEI-Zn layer at 130 &#176;C through chelating Zn ions with PEI. The PEI-Zn layer serves as a high-quality electron transporting property and surface modifying layer on Ag film. Also, the PEI/Ag/PEI-Zn electrode exhibited remarkable mechanical durability of flexible organic solar cells (FOSCs) compared with indium tin oxiden (ITO)-based devices in consecutive bending experiments. PEI/Ag/PEI-Zn electrode was also applied in flexible perovskite solar cells. Their PCE performance reaches as high as 19.24% and also maintains 73% of its initial value after 500 bending cycles, which is much better than ITO-based flexible devices. Above all, both enhancement in light transmittance and PCE performance of both FOSCs and FPSCs underscores the superior properties of PEI/Ag/PEI-Zn flexible electrodes.</description></item><item><title>Performance of 2-D/3-D Mixed-Dimension Tin Perovskite Solar Cells and Their Prospects Under Bifacial Configuration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769764</link><description>This work focuses on the design and development of lead-free halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, 3-D and 2-D/3-D mixed-dimension tin PSCs have been fabricated by adding phenylethylammonium iodide (PEAI) in varying quantities. A maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE$|$MAX) of 11.03% has been obtained at a PEAI concentration of 15%, with indium tin oxide (ITO) and Ag as the front and rear electrodes, respectively. Addition of PEAI has also improved the stability of the solar cells. Using the measured properties from this device, monofacial and bifacial designs for the same material stack has been simulated by using suitable rear electrodes, without changing the front electrode. Silvaco 2-D TCAD software has been used for this purpose. With Ag and ITO as rear electrodes, the monofacial designs gave PCE$|$ MAX values of 17.94% and 12.79%, respectively. On the other hand, the bifacial design with a concurrent AM1.5G illumination of 1 sun intensity, the device gave a PCE$|$ MAX of 26.55%. The study also examined the impact of albedo effects from various reflecting surfaces on the performance of this bifacial perovskite solar cell (BPSC). Notably, snow albedo positively influenced efficiency of the BPSC, increasing it by 38.85% compared with that of monofacial perovskite solar cell (MPSC) with Ag rear electrode. Conversely, albedos from soil, seawater, and pond water resulted in lower efficiencies, even falling below those of MPSCs with Ag back electrodes. These results indicate that bifacial design has the potential to be an efficient and cost-effective solution for tin-based PSCs.</description></item><item><title>SnO2-Ti3C2 Blends as Electron Transport Layer for Efficient and Easily Fabricated Planar Perovskite Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769606</link><description>In this work, the SnO2-Ti3C2 hybrid electron transport layer (ETL) was prepared by incorporating two-dimensional Ti3C2-MXene into SnO2 and appropriate ultraviolet (UV) ozone treatment. The synergistic effect of Ti3C2 introduction and UV ozone treatment on the charge transport capacity of SnO2 ETL, interface properties of ETL/perovskite, perovskite morphology, and device performance was systematically investigated. The results show that the introduction of Ti3C2 does not affect the morphology and transmittance of SnO2 ETL. The perovskite films based on SnO2-Ti3C2 are not only dense, but also have smaller surface roughness, more uniform, and larger grain size, even penetrating the entire perovskite film. The surface oxidation of Ti3C2 induced by UV-ozone treatment enhanced the charge transport capacity of ETL. The electron extraction and charge transfer at the interface between SnO2-Ti3C2 ETL and perovskite are higher, and carrier recombination is effectively suppressed. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on SnO2-Ti3C2 ETL have larger charge recombination impedance and higher electron mobility, mainly due to enhanced ETL charge transport and optimization of interface properties. The short-circuit current (Jsc) and filling factor (FF) of PSCs are increased by 5% and 7% respectively, delivering a champion device with a relatively high FF of 79.38% and high power conversion efficiency of 19.52%, as well as good stability. Thus, this study provides a simple and effective method for the preparation of efficient and repeatable PSCs and paves the way for the industrialization of PSCs to a certain extent.</description></item><item><title>Effect of High Monochromatic Radiation on the Electrical Performance of CIGS Solar Cell</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10770815</link><description>In this article, we investigate the optically induced degradation of Cu(InGa)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells subjected to monochromatic laser irradiation. The devices under test are bifacial CIGS solar cells, fabricated on fluorine-doped SnO2 glass substrates. The electrical properties under dark and illumination conditions were characterized before laser exposure. The analysis of the current&#8211;voltage characteristics indicated that defect-assisted carrier transport dominates within the space charge region. Continuous laser exposure at constant optical power caused a decrease in open-circuit voltage (Voc). The study of the dark current&#8211;voltage curves highlights a change in the saturation current (IS) and ideality factor (n), whose increment follows a square-root dependence on time. This behavior is attributed to diffusion of Na ions toward the junction. Conversely, the Voc decay (which is correlated with the turn-on voltage decrease in dark I&#8211;V curve) is ascribed to a light-induced defect generation that enhances leakage current at the CdS/CIGS interface.</description></item><item><title>Electrical Modeling of Bifacial PV Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777507</link><description>Although the bifacial photovoltaic (PV) module is now a mature technology, there still exists a gap in the literature on its electrical modeling and equivalent circuit representation. Most published studies have mainly focused on the photocurrent while overlooking other crucial parameters for the electrical response of the module. Even so, the photocurrent of the bifacial module is simplistically treated as the sum of individual currents of the front and rear sides, a hypothesis challenged in this study. Notably, our research has uncovered a discrepancy that can exceed 15%, and we address this issue by introducing a correction factor in this article. This article introduces a comprehensive electrical model that effectively integrates bifacial PV modules' front and rear sides into a single $-$ circuit representation. This novel model adopts the single $-$ diode equivalent circuit, formulating each of the five parameters as a function of the individual side's parameters. Indoor and outdoor measurements validate the accuracy improvement brought by this model, which can benefit energy yield studies and our theoretical understanding of bifacial PV systems.</description></item><item><title>Combining Production Data Timeseries and Infrared Thermography to Assess the Impact of Thermal Signatures on Photovoltaic Yield Over Time</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750111</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) modules with thermal signatures can be detected by infrared thermography (IRT) and the resulting power loss from these modules can be estimated through analysis of corresponding energy yield time series data. In the present work, we combine these methods to analyze the effect of PV module degradation modes on the overall energy generation in a 75 MWp PV power plant. We find that 0.2% of the PV modules are affected by thermal signatures after 5 years of operation and that the thermal signatures lead to a 0.06% reduction in power plant yield. We calculate a payback time of the IRT scan and subsequent replacement of modules affected by thermal signatures of more than 10 years for the investigated power plant. However, the power loss associated with thermal signatures seems to develop nonlinearly over time. This underlines the importance of continuous, long-term monitoring: it enables monitoring of performance in relation to warranty limits and supports prioritization of replacement actions required for cost-effective operations and maintenance strategies. This information is also required to understand PV module degradation modes, their time dependence and their dependence on module technology and climates.</description></item><item><title>Degradation Analysis of 38-Year-Old PV Modules Under the Weather Conditions of Sana'a-Yemen</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10740403</link><description>In this article, a degradation analysis of seventeen 38-year-old PV modules is conducted to estimate the degradation rates of PPeak, ISC, VOC, and fill factor, and identify the degradation modes that affected these modules. The modules under investigation were degraded under two different conditions: 16 modules were operated in the field, for 38 years, as a part of an off-grid photovoltaic system that was installed on the roof of the Faculty of Science, Sana'a University in Yemen, and one module was stored in a warehouse for the same period (exposure period&lt;48 h). Visual inspection, I&#8211;V curve measurement, infrared thermal imaging, electroluminescence imaging, and insulation test have been carried out for each module. Upon comparing with reference values as given by the manufacturer, the median peak power degradation rate of the field-exposed modules over the outdoor exposure period was found to be 25.37%. While the peak power degradation rate of the warehoused module was found to be 14.30%. Encapsulant delamination from cells along grid fingers, corrosion of cell fingers, and hot spots were detected in the warehoused module. On the other hand, encapsulant discoloration, shunting defect, humidity corrosion, front delamination, cell fingers corrosion, interconnect ribbons corrosion, hot spots, and finger interruptions were the principal causes of performance degradation of the field-exposed modules.

The processes of identifying, classifying, and rectifying defects are critical for ensuring the long-term sustainability and performance integrity of PV installations. This article introduces an innovative ensemble convolutional neural network (CNN) model that employs weighted feature fusion to enhance accuracy beyond what is achievable with a singular CNN architecture. By utilizing three proficient CNNs&#8212;VGG16, ResNet, and MobileNet&#8212;the fusion of deep features extracted from the last layers of these networks&#8217; augments performance, while also capitalizing on the integration of data from multiple CNNs with distinct configurations. This methodology was applied to a publicly available infrared thermography imaging dataset, which includes 12 distinct defects. The proposed models have been subsequently trained, validated, and tested on this dataset. The outcomes indicate a substantial enhancement in the accuracy of defect classification compared to individual CNN models, with an average accuracy of 96%. This approach underscores its utility in defect identification, particularly demonstrating the capacity of the ensemble CNN to classify defects with high precision</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Time-Series Approaches for Photovoltaic System Performance Forecasting With Sparse Datasets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10735343</link><description>Solar-based power generation presents challenges for system and grid operators due to the intermittent nature of power supply. Predicting the performance of photovoltaic (PV) power plants and rooftop systems can often be challenging due to difficulties in data collection and incoherencies in interconnected systems. Following the hierarchical aggregation structure from geographical and temporal similarities between PV systems, we suggest a simplified approach to predicting the performance of individual installations and evaluating the impact of these hypothetical installations on the overall grid. We use the hierarchical nature of power generation and ascertain weather datasets to predict the performance of new or existing systems for locations with unmeasured input data. We demonstrate an approach that could improve grid stability by using a hierarchical model on publicly available datasets on utility and rooftop installations. Ensemble machine learning algorithms are trained with 16 weeks of known hourly input training features to form a baseline model for known locations. The prediction accuracy is then directly compared for locations with known and unknown input features, both on a granular and subregion level. We observe a reduction in prediction accuracy by 6&#8211;8% using the hierarchical approach. The accuracy of the hierarchical model can be further enhanced beyond our work by increasing the training dataset temporally, as well as by augmenting nested layers of the hierarchy.</description></item><item><title>ResAG-UNet: A Novel Residual Attention Gated UNet for Cloud Segmentation in Sky Image</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10749981</link><description>Cloud cover significantly impacts the solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface, thereby influencing the efficiency and output of solar energy systems. Consequently, an accurate cloud segmentation approach is crucial for understanding fluctuations in solar irradiance in real time and future ahead. Such understanding aids in optimizing energy production and grid management. In this article, we designed a novel deep learning architecture called Residual Attention Gated-UNet (ResAG-UNet) for accurate cloud segmentation. The proposed ResAG-UNet integrates residual blocks in both the encoder and decoder paths, along with an attention mechanism in the decoder path. The inclusion of residual blocks facilitates faster gradient movement due to skip pathways across them, thereby enhancing training efficiency. Furthermore, the incorporation of an attention module in ResAG-UNet allows for the learning of attention coefficients for various pixels. This mechanism actively highlights crucial characteristics while suppressing less significant ones in the cloud image. The proposed ResAG-UNet model is assessed and compared with benchmark segmentation models using NITK and SWIMSEG sky datasets. The proposed approach yields mean IOU, precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy of (0.8616, 0.8826), (0.9761,0.9965), (0.9863,0.9764), (0.9237,0.9613), and (0.9424, 0.9651) on the NITK and SWIMSEG sky datasets, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Drivers and Barriers to the Public Acceptance of Floating Photovoltaics Compared to Land-Based Photovoltaics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747283</link><description>In floating photovoltaics (FPV), modules are installed on bodies of water to alleviate the land competition arising from the growing deployment of photovoltaics (PV). However, the installation of artificial structures on water basins can affect the landscape and raise concerns even among those in favor of renewables. This work specifically investigates the public acceptance of FPV among renewable energy supporters to identify its main drivers and barriers. The investigation was conducted through a public survey, which counted more than 300 respondents favorable to renewable energies. The findings reveal that, while public acceptance of FPV remains positive, it is lower than that experienced by renewable energy systems in general. This disparity is mainly due to concerns surrounding the landscape and fauna impacts of this novel technology. In particular, an inverse relationship between FPV acceptance and its perceived alteration of the landscape beauty is found. Notably, respondents expressing a negative opinion on FPV are also those most concerned by the landscape impact of traditional PV. The investigation also proposes some preliminary solutions for enhancing FPV's social acceptance. The effectiveness of these potential measures is evaluated, providing valuable insights for stakeholders and policymakers in the renewable energy sector.</description></item><item><title>A 16-bit 1-MS/s SAR ADC With Capacitor Mismatch Self-Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753035</link><description>This article introduces a successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that utilizes a foreground capacitor mismatch self-calibration method. The proposed floating operation puts the uncalibrated high-bit capacitor into the floating state, preventing the sub-ADC from saturating caused by comparator static offset during the calibration process. To address the random mismatch of the LSB capacitors and improve the calibration accuracy, this article employs round-robin grouping of eight sets of LSB capacitors. In addition, a precharged bootstrapped switch is proposed to achieve high sampling linearity with low power consumption and area overhead. An anti-interference custom-designed 0.5-fF capacitor structure is suggested for binary-weighted capacitor mismatch of capacitive DAC (CDAC). Furthermore, the circuit implementation of the comparator utilized by ADC is also discussed. The prototype was fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process with a 1.8-V supply and achieved spurious-free dynamic ranges of 108.9 and 92.38 dB at an input frequency of 1 kHz while operating at sampling rates of 100 kS/s and 1 MS/s, respectively. The prototype consumes 6.745 mW and occupies 0.91  $\text {mm}^{2}$ .</description></item><item><title>CR-DRAM: Improving DRAM Refresh Energy Efficiency With Inter-Subarray Charge Recycling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10677355</link><description>A dynamic random access memory (DRAM) relies on periodic refresh operations to prevent data loss caused by charge leakage. As memory capacities continue to grow, refresh power consumption accounts for an increasing proportion of the total DRAM power, and in some contexts, it even becomes a major contributor to power consumption. To address this issue, previous research has explored the tradeoff between DRAM reliability and refresh overhead. However, DRAM reliability degrades as technology nodes advance, making these approaches inapplicable in scenarios, such as servers, where high data reliability is critical. Furthermore, these approaches require modifications to the standard DRAM interface protocol and memory controller (MC), rendering them infeasible for standalone use in computer systems. In this article, we propose an energy-efficient charge-recycling DRAM (CR-DRAM), which enables multiple rounds of charge (i.e., energy) recycling between subarrays within a single autorefresh (AR) process. After refreshing a row, CR-DRAM reuses the charge stored in the bitline (BL) capacitors to supply power for refreshing the next row in another subarray, rather than discharging them directly. Since CR-DRAM is compatible with the joint electron device engineering council (JEDEC) interface standard, it can be easily integrated into modern computer systems. Our circuit-level simulation shows that CR-DRAM significantly reduces AR power consumption by 33.9% compared with conventional DRAM, with a modest area overhead of less than 0.9%. Furthermore, our system-level evaluation shows that CR-DRAM offers an average energy savings of 9.2% (maximum of 11.9%) compared with 8-Gb double data rate 4 (DDR4) DRAM across SPEC-2006 benchmark workloads.</description></item><item><title>A 0.05&#8211;1.5-GHz PVT-Insensitive Digital-to-Time Converter for QKD Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659712</link><description>This work introduces a dual-channel digital-to-time converter (DTC) featuring a broad tuning range, which utilizes a dual delay-locked loop (DLL) architecture to achieve clock or data deskewing and precise timing adjustment effectively. The coarse- and fine-tuning mechanisms are operated in precise closed-loop schemes to lessen the effects of the ambient variations. The replica fine voltage-controlled delay line can provide subgate resolution and instantaneous switching capability. Then, the replica coarse voltage-controlled delay line can provide a wide dynamic delay range. The proposed DTC can generate variable delays for an arbitrary pseudorandom data rate of up to 3 Gb/s and is insensitive to process and temperature variation. The test chip, fabricated in a 55-nm CMOS process, operates from 0.05 to 1.5 GHz and achieves a timing resolution of 9.77 ps, a power consumption of 12 mW, and an area of 0.76 mm2. The measured maximum integral nonlinearity (INL) is 2.20 LSB in an extended delay mode. In the dual delay mode, the maximum INL of channels 0 and 1 is 1.60 and &#8722;1.08 LSB, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Single-Stage Gain-Boosted Cascode Amplifier With Three-Layer Cascode Feedback Amplifier for Front-End SHA in High-Linearity Pipelined ADC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638486</link><description>In this brief, a high-gain and wide-bandwidth single-stage gain-boosted cascode amplifier (GBCA) is proposed for the front-end sample-and-hold amplifier (SHA) in 14-bit 2.5-GS/s pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC). This GBCA is composed of a two-layer main cascode amplifier and a three-layer cascode feedback amplifier (FA). The three-layer cascode structure introduces more than 20-dB gain enhancement compared with conventional two-layer FAs. However, adjacent poles appear near the gain bandwidth product (GBW) of the three-layer cascode FA, which may seriously deteriorate the phase margin (PM) of the FA and further prolong the settling time of closed-loop GBCA. A PM expansion technique is proposed to improve the PM of FA by adding a group of switched capacitor array. At the same time, the open-loop GBCA achieves 104-dB direct-current (dc) gain and 65.2-GHz GBW, which satisfies the harsh requirements of the ping-pong interleaved SHA with 12-dB gain on-chip. The pipelined ADC fabricated in 28-nm CMOS process consumes 554 mW at 2.5-GS/s sampling rate, while achieves a signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 52.5 dB and a spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) of 86.4 dBc with 161-MHz input signal.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Domain and Pipelined Analog Computing Chain for MVM Computation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10695032</link><description>In this article, a stream-architecture and pipelined hybrid computing chain is presented to process matrix-vector multiplication (MVM). In each stage of the computing chain, a primary multiply-accumulate (MAC) stage consisting of charge, time, and digital domain processing units makes signed or unsigned  $8\times 1\times 8$  bit MAC operations and MSB quantization. Based on the stream architecture, the length of the computing chain can be configured to fit different MVM applications. In the charge-domain MAC unit, a double-plate sampling and weighted capacitor array with writing yield and efficiency enhanced 7T bitcell and three-step weighting scheme is implemented. To utilize the speed and resolution advantages of time-domain computing, a high linearity voltage-to-time converter (VTC) followed by a dynamic tristate delay chain is proposed to transfer and store MAC values from the charge domain in the time domain. To realize fast analog readout, a folding type and distributed time-to-digital converter (TDC) is proposed. To fully eliminate the offset and variation in the distributed TDC, a specific residue readout timing and back-end calibration scheme are applied. In the digital domain, a double-input and double-clock dynamic D flip-flop is built to realize partial sum transmission and accumulation in a single cycle with low energy and area consumption. Post-simulation results show that this computing chain can achieve 20.89&#8211;40.72-TOPS/W energy efficiency and 4.498-TOPS/mm2 throughput.</description></item><item><title>Detect and Replace: Efficient Soft Error Protection of FPGA-Based CNN Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648661</link><description>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used in computer vision and natural language processing. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are a popular accelerator for CNNs. However, FPGAs are prone to suffer soft errors, so the reliability of FPGA-based CNNs becomes a key problem when used in safety-critical applications. The convolution module based on a processing element (PE) array is the most complex part of the accelerator, so it is the key to efficient protection. Coding-based schemes have been proposed for efficient protection of the convolution module, where the processing of the PE array is modeled as parallel matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs), and every wrong output would be concurrently detected and corrected. However, these schemes cannot deal with errors in the configuration memory that affects many intermediate results. In this article, a protection scheme is proposed based on faulty PE detection and replace (DR) to deal with such configuration memory errors. The DR scheme is implemented on a CNN accelerator based on Xilinx Zynq 7000 SoC, and fault injection (FI) experiments are performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed DR scheme. The results show that it can effectively mitigate the effect of soft errors in the configuration memory with an overhead of about 1.3 times complexity and 1.4 times power consumption relative to those of the unprotected PE array. Compared with the advanced checksum-of-checksum (CoC) scheme, the DR scheme decreases power consumption by up to 30%.</description></item><item><title>MCM-SR: Multiple Constant Multiplication-Based CNN Streaming Hardware Architecture for Super-Resolution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777852</link><description>Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based super-resolution (SR) methods have become prevalent in display devices due to their superior image quality. However, the significant computational demands of CNN-based SR require hardware accelerators for real-time processing. Among the hardware architectures, the streaming architecture can significantly reduce latency and power consumption by minimizing external dynamic random access memory (DRAM) access. Nevertheless, this architecture necessitates a considerable hardware area, as each layer needs a dedicated processing engine. Furthermore, achieving high hardware utilization in this architecture requires substantial design expertise. In this article, we propose methods to reduce the hardware resources of CNN-based SR accelerators by applying the multiple constant multiplication (MCM) algorithm. We propose a loop interchange method for the convolution (CONV) operation to reduce the logic area by 23% and an adaptive loop interchange method for each layer that considers both the static random access memory (SRAM) and logic area simultaneously to reduce the SRAM size by 15%. In addition, we improve the MCM graph exploration speed by  $5.4\times $  while maintaining the SR quality through beam search when CONV weights are approximated to reduce the hardware resources.</description></item><item><title>FPGA-Based Low-Bit and Lightweight Fast Light Field Depth Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10757308</link><description>The 3-D vision computing is a key application in unmanned systems, satellites, and planetary rovers. Learning-based light field (LF) depth estimation is one of the major research directions in 3-D vision computing. However, conventional learning-based depth estimation methods involve a large number of parameters and floating-point operations, making it challenging to achieve low-power, fast, and high-precision LF depth estimation on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Motivated by this issue, an FPGA-based low-bit, lightweight LF depth estimation network (L $^{3}\text {FNet}$ ) is proposed. First, a hardware-friendly network is designed, which has small weight parameters, low computational load, and a simple network architecture with minor accuracy loss. Second, we apply efficient hardware unit design and software-hardware collaborative dataflow architecture to construct an FPGA-based fast, low-bit acceleration engine. Experimental results show that compared with the state-of-the-art works with lower mean-square error (mse), L $^{3}\text {FNet}$  can reduce the computational load by more than 109 times and weight parameters by approximately 78 times. Moreover, on the ZCU104 platform, it requires 95.65% lookup tables (LUTs), 80.67% digital signal processors (DSPs), 80.93% BlockRAM (BRAM), 58.52% LUTRAM, and 9.493-W power consumption to achieve an efficient acceleration engine with a latency as low as 272 ns.

We develop PROCEED-LT, a pathfinding framework to co-optimize devices and circuits over a wide performance range. Our results demonstrate that circuit operations at LT (&#8722;196 &#176;C) reduce power compared to room temperature (RT, 85 &#176;C) by  $15\times $  to over  $23.8\times $  depending on performance level.

Conventional optimization methods, such as case-specific approaches and black-box optimization approaches, often fall short of addressing the diverse and complex nature of RISC-V designs. To achieve optimal results across various RISC-V designs, we propose the cooperative optimization framework (COF) that integrates multiple black-box optimizers, each specializing in different optimization problems. The COF introduces the landscape knowledge exchange mechanism (LKEM) to direct the optimizers to share their knowledge of the optimization problem. Moreover, the COF employs the dynamic computational resource allocation (DCRA) strategies to dynamically allocate computational resources to the optimizers. The DCRA strategies are guided by the optimizer efficiency evaluation (OEE) mechanism and a time series forecasting (TSF) model. The OEE provides real-time performance evaluations. The TSF model forecasts the optimization progress made by the optimizers, given the allocated computational resources. In our experiments, the COF reduced the cycle per instruction (CPI) of the Berkeley out-of-order machine (BOOM) by 15.36% and the power of Rocket-Chip by 12.84% without constraint violation compared to the respective initial designs.</description></item><item><title>An End-to-End Bundled-Data Asynchronous Circuits Design Flow: From RTL to GDS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10701060</link><description>Asynchronous circuits with low power and robustness are revived in emerging applications such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and neuromorphic chips, thanks to clock-less and event-driven mechanisms. However, the lack of mature computer-aided design (CAD) tools for designing large-scale asynchronous circuits results in low design efficiency and high cost. This article proposes an end-to-end bundled-data (BD) asynchronous circuit design flow, which can facilitate building asynchronous circuits, even if the designer has little or no asynchronous circuit foundation. Three features that enable this are: 1) a lightweight circuit converter developed in Python can convert circuits from synchronous descriptions to corresponding asynchronous ones at register transfer level (RTL). Desynchronization flow helps designers maintain a &#8220;synchronization mentality&#8221; to construct asynchronous circuits; 2) a synchronization-like verification method is proposed for asynchronous circuits so that it can be functionally verified before synthesis. Avoids the risk of rework after logic defects are discovered during the synthesis and implementation, as asynchronous circuits often cannot be simulated until gate-level (GL) netlist generation; and 3) the whole implementation flow from RTL to graphic data system (GDS) is based on commercial electronic design automation (EDA) tools. Similar to the design flow of synchronous circuits, it helps designers implement asynchronous circuits with &#8220;synchronization habits.&#8221; Furthermore, to validate this methodology, two asynchronous processors were, respectively, implemented and evaluated in the TSMC 28-nm CMOS process. Compared to their synchronous counterparts, the general-purpose asynchronous RISC-V processor achieves 20.5% power savings. And the domain-specific asynchronous spiking neural network (SNN) accelerator achieves 58.46% power savings and  $2.41\times $  energy efficiency improvement at 70% input spike sparsity.</description></item><item><title>A 0.875&#8211;0.95-pJ/b 40-Gb/s PAM-3 Baud-Rate Receiver With One-Tap DFE</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777920</link><description>This article presents a 40-Gb/s (25.6-GBaud) three-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-3) baud-rate receiver with one-tap decision-feedback equalize (DFE). A baud-rate phase detector (BRPD) that locks at the point with zero first postcursor is proposed. In addition, by reusing the BRPD&#8217;s error samplers, a weighting coefficient calibration is presented to select the DFE weighting coefficient that maximizes the top level of the eye diagram, thereby improving eye height across different channel losses. An inductorless continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) and a variable gain amplifier (VGA) are also included. The VGA adjusts the output common-mode resistance to control data swing, reducing power consumption when the required swing is small. Furthermore, by using the modified summer-merged slicers, the capacitance from the slicers to the VGA is reduced. Finally, a digital clock/data recovery (CDR) circuit is presented, which includes a demultiplexer (DeMUX) with a short delay time to reduce the loop latency. The 40-Gb/s PAM-3 receiver is fabricated in 28-nm CMOS technology. For a 25.6-Gbaud pseudorandom ternary sequence of  $3^{7}$ &#8211;1, the measured bit error rate (BER) is below  $10^{-12}$  for channel losses of 9 and 17.5 dB. At a 9-dB loss, total power consumption is 35-mW with a calculated FoM of 0.875-pJ/bit.

The evolving compute-in-memory (CiM) paradigm tackles this issue by facilitating simultaneous processing and storage within static random-access memory (SRAM) elements. Numerous design decisions taken at different levels of hierarchy affect the figures of merit (FoMs) of SRAM, such as power, performance, area, and yield. The absence of a rapid assessment mechanism for the impact of changes at different hierarchy levels on global FoMs poses a challenge to accurately evaluating innovative SRAM designs. This article presents an automation tool designed to optimize the energy and latency of SRAM designs incorporating diverse implementation strategies for executing logic operations within the SRAM.

The proposed converter can directly take a 4.2-V battery voltage and produce four power rails ranging from 1.8 V for I/O to 0.5 V for the processor core. The three-level input stage is chosen to reduce the inductor ripple size and switching loss, thus increasing power conversion efficiency (PCE). In addition, the fully digital implementation using novel domino flash analog-digital converters (ADCs) enables low static current. Also, pulse frequency modulation (PFM) results in a wide dynamic range. The proposed three-level SIMO converter has been prototyped in a 65-nm CMOS technology with the 32-bit RISC-V processor.

Quantized multiprecision DNNs (MP-DNNs), denoted as MP-DNNs, offer a promising solution for these limitations but pose challenges for the existing RISC-V processors due to complex instructions, suboptimal parallel processing, and inefficient dataflow mapping. To tackle the challenges mentioned above, SPEED, a scalable RISC-V vector (RVV) processor, is proposed to enable efficient MP-DNN inference, incorporating innovations in customized instructions, hardware architecture, and dataflow mapping. First, some dedicated customized RISC-V instructions are introduced based on RVV extensions to reduce the instruction complexity, allowing SPEED to support processing precision ranging from 4- to 16-bit with minimized hardware overhead.

The receiver&#8217;s high-linearity mode and high-gain mode can be configured by either bypassing or including the low-noise amplifier (LNA) stage. An agile-switching module is designed to facilitate the mode transitioning. In high-gain mode, a variable-gain current-reused shunt-feedback (VGCRSF) LNA with radio frequency (RF) gain-adapted impedance matching technique is proposed. Instead of utilizing a shared transconductance (Gm) stage in both the I- and Q-path, the Gm-separated IQ-leakage suppression (GSIQLS) structure is employed in the mixer stage to reduce the complex and frequency-dependent IQ mismatch engendered by the nonideal local oscillator (LO) signal overlap. In baseband, both the gain and the bandwidth are made configurable through the utilization of a bi-quad low pass filter (LPF) and a programmable gain amplifier (PGA). The proposed receiver is fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS technology. Measurement results indicate a maximum conversion gain of 78.5 dB and a minimum noise figure (NF) of 2.5 dB are achieved.

Typically, countermeasures against power side-channel attacks (PSCAs) are based on specialized dc/dc converters, resulting in large power and area overheads and they are difficult to scale. Moreover, due to limited output voltage range and load regulation, it is not feasible to directly distribute these converters in multicore applications. Targeting those issues, our proposed converter is designed to provide multiple fast-responding voltages and use shared circuits to mitigate PSCAs. The proposed three-output dc/dc converter can deliver 0.33&#8211;0.92 V with up to 1 A to each load. Comparing with state-of-the-art power management works, our converter has  $2\times $  load step response speed and  $4\times $  reference voltage tracking speed. Furthermore, the converter requires  $9\times $  less inductance and  $3\times $  less output capacitance. In terms of PSCA mitigation, this converter reduces the correlation between input power trace and encryption load current by  $107\times $ , which is  $3\times $  better than the best standalone work, and it only induces 1.7% area overhead and 2.5% power overhead. The proposed work also increases minimum traces to disclose (MTDs) by  $1250\times $ . Considering all the above, our work could be a great candidate to be employed in future multicore systems supplying varying voltages and resisting side-channel attacks. It is the first work bridging the gap between on-chip power management and side-channel security.</description></item><item><title>Securet3d: An Adaptive, Secure, and Fault-Tolerant Aware Routing Algorithm for Vertically&#8211;Partially Connected 3D-NoC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10766899</link><description>Multiprocessor systems-on-chip (MPSoCs) based on 3-D networks-on-chip (3D-NoCs) are crucial architectures for robust parallel computing, efficiently sharing resources across complex applications. To ensure the secure operation of these systems, it is essential to implement adaptive, fault-tolerant mechanisms capable of protecting sensitive data. This work proposes the Securet3d routing algorithm, which establishes secure data paths in fault-tolerant 3D-NoCs. Our approach enhances the Reflect3d algorithm by introducing a detailed scheme for mapping secure paths and improving the system&#8217;s ability to withstand faults. To validate its effectiveness, we compare Securet3d with three other fault-tolerant routing algorithms for vertically-partially connected 3D-NoCs. All algorithms were implemented in SystemVerilog and evaluated through simulation using ModelSim and hardware synthesis with Cadence&#8217;s Genus tool. Experimental results show that Securet3d reduces latency and enhances cost-effectiveness compared with other approaches. When implemented with a 28-nm technology library, Securet3d demonstrates minimal area and energy overhead, indicating scalability and efficiency. Under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, Securet3d maintains basically unaltered average packet latencies on 70, 90, and 29 clock cycles for uniform random, bit-complement, and shuffle traffic, significantly lower than those of other algorithms without including security mechanisms (5763, 4632, and 3712 clock cycles in average, respectively). These results highlight the superior security, scalability, and adaptability of Securet3d for complex communication systems.</description></item><item><title>Design of Low-Complexity Quantized Compressive Sensing Using Measurement Predictive Coding</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634299</link><description>Block-based compressive sensing (BCS) has evolved as a promising method for smart devices with limited bandwidth and computing capabilities, striking a balance between image/video quality and transmission efficiency. Despite its advantages, BCS falls short in reducing bitrate compared with traditional acquisition systems, because it increases the number of bits per measurement, which leads to high storage and transmission costs. In this context, we propose a measurement predictive coding (MPC) along with the quantization method in integration with BCS named BCS-MPC; here, we have performed the quantization with bit shifts only instead of binary division. The proposed method reduces the number of bits per compressive sensing (CS) measurement as well as the transmission of the quantization step size. Furthermore, it reduces the latency and hardware resources. The proposed method improved on average +3.44 to +8.28 dB in PSNR over the current works. From the synthesis results, the proposed BCS-MPC method requires 26.11%, 18.89%, and 82.53% less area, power, and delay over the existing work. We have achieved a reduction in delay with bit-shift operations.</description></item><item><title>High-Performance Error and Erasure Decoding With Low Complexities Using SPC-RS Concatenated Codes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623603</link><description>In this brief, a novel single parity check-assisted error and erasure decoding (SPC-EED) algorithm over the compound channel is proposed for Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. EED is applied to the scheme of SPC-RS concatenation code. The proposed algorithm can correct most random errors with the assistance of SPC codes. Through using channel soft information, the symbols with burst errors can be identified accurately and efficiently for erasures in EED. Simulation results show that the SPC-EED algorithm can achieve coding gains of up to 0.1, 0.4, and 2.1 dB compared with burst-error correcting (BC)-SPC-ordered statistic decoding (OSD), BC-OSD, and BCHDD-low-complexity chase (LCC) for RS(255, 239) codes, respectively, at symbol error rate (SER) = 10&#8722;3. The proposed algorithm has lower computational complexities while maintaining better decoding performance. The hardware design of the SPC-threshold check module is provided. The implementation results in ASIC show that compared with the BCHDD-LCC decoder, the SPC-EED decoder improves area efficiency by 249.37% with higher energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Jitter and Compact-Area Fractional-N Digital PLL With Fast Multi-Variable Calibration Using the Recursive Least-Squares Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682595</link><description>This work presents a fractional-N digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) characterized by low jitter and small area, featuring fast multi-variable calibration. To minimize the use of silicon area, the LC voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) incorporated a compact three-turn inductor. Then, to still achieve low jitter, the bandwidth of the PLL was designed to be wide to suppress the poor phase noise of this VCO. To mitigate in-band noise, a digital-to-time converter (DTC) was employed to cancel the quantization noise (Q-noise) from the  $\Delta \Sigma $ M, and a phase selector (PSEL) was used to reduce the thermal noise of the DTC. The effectiveness of these jitter-reduction techniques relies on digital background calibration. However, conventional multi-variable calibrators (MVCs), which utilize the least-mean-squares (LMS) algorithm, suffer from a prolonged convergence time. To overcome this limitation, this work introduced a recursive least-squares (RLS)-based MVC using a dichotomous coordinate descent (DCD) algorithm that can facilitate rapid calibration at a moderate implementation cost. The proposed DCD-RLS MVC achieved a calibration time of less than  $7.2~{\mu }$ s, which was 40 times faster than the LMS MVC. The DPLL of this work achieved 88 fsrms jitter at a near-integer-N channel with 68-dBc fractional spurs. Fabricated using a 40-nm CMOS process, it occupied only a 0.12-mm2 active area and consumed 15.7 mW of power.</description></item><item><title>A Millimeter-Wave Four-Way Doherty Power Amplifier With Over-GHz Modulation Bandwidth</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10675497</link><description>This article presents the design and analysis of a millimeter-wave (mmWave) four-way Doherty power amplifier (PA), aiming to enhance the PA energy efficiency when amplifying orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based 5G new radio (NR) signals with a 10&#8211;12-dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). We first introduce a systematic approach to extending a conventional two-way Doherty PA to N ways, followed by a new transformer-based N-way Doherty network synthesis flow. The proposed network synthesis achieves N-way Doherty load modulation using ( $N-1$ ) transformers, one fewer transformer and thus lower loss than conventional designs. In addition, it enables the desired impedance transformation from  $R_{\text {ANT}}$  to  $R_{\text {OPT}}$  and effectively absorbs the parasitic capacitance of the power cells. Along with the Doherty network, we also introduce a high-speed adaptive biasing circuit, addressing the modulation bandwidth bottleneck in prior Doherty PA demonstrations. As proof of concept, a four-way Doherty PA prototype is implemented in the 47-GHz 5G band (band n262) using the GlobalFoundries 45-nm CMOS silicon-on-insulator (SOI) process. It achieves 24.0-dBm saturated power ( $P_{\text {SAT}}$ ), 23.7-dBm output 1-dB compression point ( $P_{1\,\text {dB}}$ ), 26.8% peak power-added efficiency ( $\text {PAE}_{\text {PEAK}}$ ), 26.3% PAE at  $P_{1\,\text {dB}}$  ( $\text {PAE}_{1\,\text {dB}}$ ), 21.7% PAE at 6-dB back-off ( $\text {PAE}_{6\,\text {dB}}$ ), and 13.1% PAE at 12-dB back-off ( $\text {PAE}_{12\,\text {dB}}$ ), demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. In the modulation tests, the PA achieves 14.1-dBm average output power ( $P_{\text {avg}}$ ) and 13.7% average efficiency ( $\text {PAE}_{\text {avg}}$ ) when amplifying a 2000-MHz 5G NR 64-QAM OFDM signal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first silicon PA demonstration of 2000-MHz channel modulation bandwidth for 5G NR OFDM along with back-off efficiency enhancement up to 12-dB back-off.</description></item><item><title>A Chain-Weaver Balanced Power Amplifier With an Embedded Impedance/Power Sensor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10679720</link><description>This article introduces an N-way chain-weaver balanced power amplifier (PA) for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) phased-array transmitters (TXs). Taking advantage of the proposed combining network, an embedded impedance/power sensor is implemented, which can be utilized for output power regulation, built-in self-test, and load-based performance optimization. The proposed PA architecture offers linearity and gain robustness under the antenna&#8217;s frequency/time-dependent voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR). In the event of impedance mismatch, the proposed PA provides N different loads equally distributed on the VSWR circle. Consequently, the performance of the PAs is the average of N PAs with N different loads, which makes this structure VSWR resilient. As a proof of concept, an eight-way chain-weaver balanced PA (BPA) is realized in 40-nm bulk CMOS technology, and it delivers 25.19-dBm  ${P} {_{\text {SAT}}}$  with 16.19% PAE. The proposed PA supports a 2-GHz 64-QAM OFDM signal with 16-dBm average power, achieving &#8722;25-dB error vector magnitude (EVM). The average EVM is better than &#8722;30.3 dB without digital pre-distortion (DPD) for an &#8220;800-MHz 256-QAM OFDM&#8221; signal while generating an average output power of 12.17 dBm. The performance of the PA is also evaluated under 1.5:1&#8211;3:1 VSWR conditions. The measured small-signal gain variation under VSWR 3:1 is &#177;0.7 dB. Moreover, assuming any frequency/time-dependent loading condition within the VSWR 3:1 circle, the proposed chain-weaver BPA achieves &lt;2.8&#176; amplitude-to-phase (AM-PM) over 3-GHz bandwidth. Besides, the embedded impedance/power sensor accuracy outperforms the state of the art. The proposed impedance sensor can measure VSWR 3:1 by the maximum angle and magnitude errors of 12.3&#176; and 0.106, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 23.2-to-26-GHz Low-Jitter Fast-Locking Sub-Sampling PLL Based on a Function-Reused VCO-Buffer and a Type-I FLL With Rapid Phase Alignment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684529</link><description>This article presents a type-II sub-sampling phase-locked loop (SSPLL) that achieves low jitter, low spur, and sub- $\mu $ s locking time when synthesizing millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequencies. The proposed function-reused (FR) voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-buffer eliminates the noise and capacitive loading from the transistors in the buffer, improving the jitter and reference (ref.) spur of the SSPLL simultaneously. It also eliminates the inductor typically employed in the high-frequency buffer, reducing the chip area. The proposed low-power fast frequency-locked loop (FLL) utilizes a phase aligner to decouple the dependency of the locking time on the initial phase error. The FLL also employs a coarse-fine-time-to-digital converter (TDC)-based type-I loop for promptly searching the control word of the switched capacitors (SCs). This article also details the analysis of the ref. spur and the phase noise (PN) performance using the FR VCO-buffer as well as the design considerations of the proposed FLL. Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS, the SSPLL occupies a compact area of 0.065 mm2 and achieves an rms jitter of 48.3 fs at 26 GHz while consuming 19.1 mW, corresponding to excellent FoMJ and FoMN of &#8722;253.5 and &#8722;277.6 dB, respectively. The measured ref. spur is &#8722;66 dBc, and the measured locking time at a frequency jump from 0.4 to 2.8 GHz is within 55 ref. cycles.</description></item><item><title>A Tri-Band Dual-Concurrent Wi-Fi 802.11be Transceiver Achieving &#8722;46 dB TX/RX EVM Floor at 7.1 GHz for a 4 K-QAM 320 MHz Signal</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643491</link><description>A high-linearity, wideband transceiver for Wi-Fi 7 to support 4 K-QAM 320 MHz bandwidth (BW) is presented and fabricated using a 14 nm Fin-FET CMOS process. To provide a high-performance local oscillator (LO) signal, a fractional-N sampling phase-locked loop with a high gain sampling phase detector (SPD) is implemented with digital-to-time converter (DTC) non-linearity calibration (NLC) based on a least mean square (LMS) algorithm. The transceiver exhibits excellent integrated phase noise (IPN) performances with a single-core voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) achieving &#8722;54.3 dBc at 7115 MHz frequency channel. IPN performance can be further improved to &#8722;55.2 dBc with a dual-core VCO. A wideband frequency operation transmitter (TX) architecture for a 5&#8211;7 GHz frequency range is introduced. It utilizes a high Q tunable switched inductor for a wideband matching network and flexible frequency adjustment. A coupling-minimized switched inductor (CMSI) is implemented to cancel out magnetic flux when two inductors are enabled simultaneously. This improves mutual inductance and the Q factor while extending the frequency tuning range. The TX error vector magnitude (TX EVM) floor is achieved up to &#8722;46.1 dB at 7.1 GHz, marking the best-reported value to date. A 5/6G receiver (RX) is designed to improve noise performance while maintaining linearity. To achieve this, a resistor attenuator block is introduced between a voltage-to-current (V2I) and a mixer, while a high signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) performance is maintained in a wider input power range. The RX error vector magnitude (RX EVM) floor is measured as &#8722;46 dB at 7.1 GHz. These results demonstrate the transceiver&#8217;s excellent performance, making it a promising solution for Wi-Fi 7 applications.</description></item><item><title>A 167- &#956;W 71.7-dB SFDR 2.4-GHz BLE Receiver Using a Passive Quadrature Front End, a Double- Sided Double-Balanced Cascaded Mixer, and a Dual-Transformer-Coupled Class-D VCO</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10701049</link><description>This article reports a 2.4-GHz Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) receiver with a number of passive-intensive RF functions to improve power efficiency and blocker resilience. It features a passive quadrature front end (QFE) built with a hybrid coupler plus two step-up transformers. They passively provide input-impedance matching, voltage gain, and single-ended-to-differential-I/Q RF generation. The four-phase RF outputs simplify the LO generator into a 2.4-GHz class-D voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) that has an intrinsically boosted output swing, averting the power-hungry divider-by-2 and LO buffers. The frequency down-conversion based on a double-sided double-balanced (DSDB) cascaded mixer offers a high passive gain to reduce the noise and power consumption of the baseband (BB) circuitry while securing a high spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) to tolerate the out-of-band (OOB) blockers. The BB circuitry is a power-efficient hybrid low-IF filter that employs a 2nd-order active-feedback notching to enhance the 1st-adjacent channel rejection. Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS, the BLE receiver exhibits a maximum RF-to-IF gain of 71 dB. The noise figure (NF) is 8.5 dB and the OOB-IIP3 is 20.1 dBm; they correspond to a 71.7-dB SFDR for a 2-MHz BLE channel and a 10-dB minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR $_{\min }$ ). The VCO exhibits a phase noise (PN) of &#8722;110/&#8722;119.1/&#8722;131 dBc/Hz at 1-/2.5-/10-MHz offset, corresponding to a figure of merit (FOM) of 188/189/189.1 dBc/Hz, respectively. The total power consumption of the receiver, including the VCO, is  $167~{\mu }$ W.</description></item><item><title>A 7.6-mW IR-UWB Receiver Achieving &#8722;17-dBm Blocker Resilience With a Linear RF Front-End</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10662966</link><description>This article presents a low power, linear RF front-end (RF-FE) for an 802.15.4a/z compatible impulse-radio ultrawideband (IR-UWB) receiver. A complementary topology-based LNA is proposed with a bandpass filter (BPF) integrated into its output. The LNA includes a complementary common gate (CCG) stage to isolate the BPF from the undesired loading of the LNA&#8217;s input stage to achieve a high Q and 5- to 10-GHz tuning range. This CCG stage relaxes a trade-off between headroom and linearity. Furthermore, capacitive and transformer coupling techniques are proposed in the LNA to increase its OP1dB and second-order intermodulation (IM2) by 4 and 27 dB, respectively, compared to noncomplementary counterparts without these techniques. An automatic feedback-based back-gate biasing technique is proposed for the variable gain transconductance amplifier (VGTA) following the BPF to increase VGTA&#8217;s transconductance range for a given width over length (W/L). The receiver is fabricated in a 22-nm fully depleted silicon on insulator (FDSOI) CMOS. The measured results over the 5- to 10-GHz RF frequency range show a minimum noise figure (NF) of 6 dB and a blocker resilience of &#8722;17 dBm at 7.6-mW power dissipation.</description></item><item><title>Implementation and Application of Harmonic Reset Switching in Passive Mixers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10700997</link><description>This article covers a synthesizing methodology for addressing harmonic rejection (HR) in hard-switching passive mixers. The integration of bottom and top plate mixing provides HR at both the antenna node and the output of the mixer in a passive and low-loss manner. A prototype mixer-first receiver (RX) in 45-nm partially depleted silicon-on-insulator (PD-SOI) is implemented, consuming 34.8&#8211;64.5 mW for clock frequencies ( $f_{\text {LO}}$ ) of 0.25&#8211;4 GHz and occupying an active area of 0.68 mm2. Due to the passive and early HR, it achieves an exceptional in-band (IB) harmonic blocker 1-dB compression point (B1 dB) of +14/+16.5 dBm at the third/fifth harmonics at a clock frequency of 1 GHz. Notably, with blocker powers up to 5 and 6.5 dBm at  $3f_{\text {LO}}$  and  $5f_{\text {LO}}$ , respectively, the harmonic blocker noise figure (BNF) only deteriorates by 3 dB at a clock frequency of 1 GHz. The minimal overhead of components facilitates the seamless incorporation of HR in widely tunable RXs and benefits from scaling.</description></item><item><title>A Blocker-Tolerant Non-Uniform Sub-Sampling Receiver With a Non-Uniform Discrete-Time FIR Filter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10748385</link><description>A non-uniform (NU) sub-sampling receiver (RX) with a NU discrete-time FIR (NU DT FIR) filter can create multiple tunable frequency notches both near and far from the passband via predesigned NU sampling clocks and filter coefficients. NU DT finite impulse response (FIR) acts as an anti-aliasing (AA) filter for a nonuniformly sampled signal which relaxes the subsequent ADC speed and dynamic range (DR). To save power and area and to improve linearity, the FIR filter is implemented in the current domain and shares the capacitive DAC with a subsequent asynchronous SAR ADC. A proof-of-concept NU DT FIR RX is implemented in 28 nm CMOS. It achieves up to 42 dB of blocker rejection with B1dB of 4 dBm. The receiver measures &#8722;27.4 dB EVM for a 64-QAM 100 MSymbol/s signal centered at 20 GHz in the presence of a 10-dBc blocker.

It could be improved by using tri-level cells in the IDAC, but this has not yet been realized in high-voltage (HV) CDAs due to the large difference in the common-mode levels between the DAC and the CDA. This article describes an HV CDA directly driven by an HV IDAC. By using the same output common mode for the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and CDA, the noise penalty associated with shifting the common mode is avoided. To address the distortion due to mismatch and intersymbol interference (ISI) in the IDAC, a transition-rate-balanced bidirectional real-time dynamic element matching (RTDEM) technique is also introduced. Fabricated in a 180-nm BCD process, the CDA prototype achieves a DR of 121.7 dB and a peak THD+N of -104.0 and -109.0 dB for 1- and 6-kHz inputs, respectively.

Furthermore, PWM-residual-aliasing has been revealed as a source of distortion, especially in low-power filter-less structure. This article presents a class-D amplifier (CDA) that utilizes an input-feedforward carrier to mitigate both loop filter swing and comparator delay coupling. As for the PWM-residual-aliasing, we propose a 2nd-order PWM-residual-aliasing reduction (PRAR) technique with loop compensation to achieve steeper filtering and wide-band linearity improvement. In addition, a fully passive anti-aliasing filter is used to suppress the PWM residue leakage. This CDA was fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS 5 V process.

An NPN-based front end uses two resistors to efficiently generate a PTAT and CTAT current, whose ratio is then digitized by a continuous-time (CT)  $\Delta \Sigma $ -modulator. A  $\beta $ -compensation technique is used to mitigate base current errors associated with the NPN&#8217;s finite  $\beta $ . Component mismatch and 1/f noise are mitigated by applying chopping and dynamic element matching (DEM), while the spread in  $V_{\text {BE}}$  and the ratio of the two resistors are digitally trimmed at room temperature (RT). Fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS process, the sensor draws  $2.5~\mu $ A from a supply voltage ranging from 1.4 to 2.2 V. Measurements on 40 samples show that it achieves an inaccuracy of  $\pm 0.1~^{\circ }$ C ( $3\sigma $ ) from  $- 55~^{\circ }$ C to  $125~^{\circ }$ C.

The BGR is implemented by summing the proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) and complementary to absolute temperature (CTAT) outputs of two PNP-based capacitive DACs. At the sampling rate, the DAC capacitors are pre-charged to the supply and then discharged for a fixed period via PNPs, thus biasing them and simultaneously sampling their base-emitter voltages. By using the modulator&#8217;s first integrator to sum the DAC outputs, a dynamic BGR can be realized, which does not need additional reference buffers or decoupling capacitors. To make the system fully dynamic, the modulator itself is based on capacitively biased (CB) floating inverter amplifiers (FIAs).

The proposed domino-like-buffered (DLB) design, which features multistage-cascaded buffers that progressively drive segmented pass transistors, significantly elevates non-dominant poles beyond the unity-gain frequency, thereby addressing stability challenges posed by the small output capacitor ( $C_{\mathrm {L}}$ ). This advancement allows the full exploitation of the high PSR advantage inherent in the output-pole-dominant (OPD) LDO, even with a compact on-chip  $C_{\mathrm {L}}$ . Compared to traditional LDO designs, our approach can loosen the  $C_{\mathrm {L}}$  requirement by  $2.4\times $  to maintain the same phase margin (PM). The chip, fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, is designed to supply up to 10 mA of load current with a typical dropout voltage of 200 mV. Performance tests reveal an undershoot and overshoot of 51 and 50 mV, respectively, for a 9.8-mA load step. Despite its small on-chip  $C_{\mathrm {L}}$  of 50 pF, the DLB LDO demonstrates a worst case PSR of &#8211;28 dB across frequencies from 10 Hz to 1 GHz. It also occupies a minimal silicon area of 0.012 mm2, including the on-chip  $C_{\mathrm {L}}$ .</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency Envelope-Tracking Supply Modulator Using a Class-G Linear Amplifier and a Single-Inductor Dual-Input-Dual-Output Converter for 5G NR Power Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10737452</link><description>This article presents a hybrid envelope tracking supply modulator (ETSM) comprising a class-G linear amplifier (LA), a single-inductor dual-input-dual-output (SIDIDO) converter and a switching amplifier (SA) for 5G new radio (NR) power amplifiers (PAs). With an additional supply rail, the class-G LA detects the amplitude of the input signal in real-time, adaptively utilizes the higher supply rail when the signal exhibits large swings, and seamlessly transitions to the lower supply rail when the signal swing decreases. This operation effectively reduces the average voltage drop of LA&#8217;s bias, sinking and sourcing current, thus improving the supply modulator (SM) efficiency at tracking bandwidth (BW) as high as 200 MHz. To mitigate the distortion induced on the output envelope due to high-speed switching between the different supply rails, a smooth transition technique is introduced for high linearity. An SIDIDO converter is employed to generate the LA&#8217;s supply rails efficiently and cost-effectively. The SM is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process.

The topology combines fixed-ratio 2:1 stages together with a CSCR stage to limit the voltage across the CSCR stage while boosting the allowable input voltage higher without relying on stacking capacitors or transistors. Furthermore, by running the fixed-ratio and CSCR stage out of phase, the effectiveness of the CSCR&#8217;s intermediate rails and switches is doubled, thus reducing the required transistor footprint. This article discusses a scalable implementation of this technology, leveraging an array-able voltage regulator (VR) core that encompasses the required powertransistors, capacitors, as well as local signal generation circuits, that is then combined with a single centralized controller to meet the current demands of small and large power domains. Measurement results of the VR, realized on Intel 16 technology using high-density metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors, demonstrate the transient performance and reliability of the proposed approach, while showcasing a record 12.7 W/mm2 peak power density for monolithic voltage conversion, and 92% peak efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A 12-to-1&#8211;1.8-V Hybrid DC-DC Converter With a Charge Converging Phase for Inductor Current Reduction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10679735</link><description>This article presents a 12-V-input and 1&#8211;1.8-V-output hybrid buck converter featuring a charge converging phase (CCP-HB). During this phase, charges from multiple paths converge into one flying capacitor, increasing the charge accumulated on it. Such charge gets transferred to the output in parallel with the inductor during the other phase, and thus, the average inductor current is reduced to consistently less than half of the load current across the entire voltage conversion ratio (VCR) range. This approach significantly reduces dc resistance (DCR) conduction loss and mitigates the reliance on a bulky inductor. Besides, a stacked switched-capacitor network (SCN) is adopted between the input and the output to reduce voltage stress on power switches for better efficiency. The converter was fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $  m BCD process, utilizing only 5- and 1.8-V NMOS as power switches. Measurement results show that the converter achieves a peak efficiency of 95.4% with a small DCR of 10.5 m $\Omega $ . Moreover, the CCP enables the use of a compact inductor as small as the 2016 series ( $2{\times }1.6{\times }1$  mm3) with a large DCR of 57 m $\Omega $  and a low saturation current of 3.6 A to deliver a full load of up to 5 A. The converter still maintains a peak efficiency of 94.7%, and the current density of total passive volume is up to 685 A/cm3.</description></item><item><title>A Power-Efficient Single-Mode Buck-Boost DC&#8211;DC Converter With Bilaterally Symmetrical Hybrid Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10670527</link><description>This article presents a bilaterally symmetrical hybrid buck-boost (BS-HBB) dc-dc converter designed for battery-to-3.4-V power conversion. Traditional buck-boost converters suffer from high inductor currents ( $I_{\text {L}}$ ) compared to load currents, resulting in considerable conduction losses. While many hybrid designs incorporating flying capacitors have attempted to reduce  $I_{\text {L}}$ , these topologies often struggle with non-smooth transitions between modes, the inability to reduce  $I_{\text {L}}$  in either the buck or boost region, and inefficient high-voltage switches with poor ON-resistances. In contrast, the BS-HBB topology proposed in this work enables seamless single-mode operation throughout its entire voltage conversion range. This converter not only achieves lower  $I_{\text {L}}$  in both buck and boost regions but also utilizes low-voltage CMOS switches that exhibit low ON-resistance, thereby enhancing power efficiency. The BS-HBB chip was fabricated using a 180-nm CMOS process. Designed to supply up to 1 A, this chip outputs a voltage of 3.4 V from an input voltage ranging from 2.7 to 4.2 V. A peak efficiency of 96.9% (95.5%) was achieved using an inductor having a dc resistance of 9 m $\Omega $  (250 m $\Omega $ ). This work also successfully validated the single-mode operation by demonstrating a flawless output voltage under continuously fluctuating input voltage.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Single-Inductor Bipolar-Output Converter With a Concise PWM Control for AMOLED Displays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682814</link><description>This article presents a compact single-inductor bipolar-output (SIBO) converter for active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) displays. Addressing the demand for a large load capacity within a limited form factor, we propose a hybrid SIBO converter featuring two flying capacitors ( $C_{\mathrm {F}}$ s) which are introduced to further reduce the inductor current ( ${I} _{\mathrm {L}}$ ) and voltage stress of power switches. The proposed converter mainly consists of two operation states that determine the energy charging and distribution, respectively, when the two outputs have the same load currents. To address potential loading imbalance, two auxiliary phases are incorporated into the main operation states. A concise PWM control strategy, consisting of a common-mode (CM) loop and differential-mode (DM) loop, is also proposed for bipolar output regulation with fast transient responses. The converter is fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $ m BCD process and the measured peak efficiency reaches 94.5% using a  $2.5\times 2.0\times 1.2$  mm3 inductor. Furthermore, the converter achieves 3.99 W/mm2 on-die power density with the total off-chip components occupying 15.32-mm3 volume, demonstrating that this design provides a compact solution for AMOLED displays.</description></item><item><title>An Integrated Dual-Side Series/Parallel Piezoelectric Resonator-Based DC-DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623621</link><description>The use of piezoelectric resonators (PRs) as energy storage elements in dc-dc converters has captured considerable interest, in part due to the ultra-thin planner form factor, excellent frequency/volume scaling properties, and high coupling and quality factors offered by PRs. Traditional PR-based converters, however, exhibit performance diminishment at low voltage conversion ratios (VCRs), rendering them less appealing to applications that require low VCR operation. This article presents a dual-side series/parallel PR (DSPPR)-based hybrid dc-dc converter that integrates two 2:1 switched capacitor (SC) circuits into the operation of the baseline PR-based converter, enabling efficient conversion at low VCRs (VCRs  $\leq 0.125$ ), while reducing the active area by up to  $23\times $  compared to a baseline discrete converter. Fabricated in 180 nm BCD technology, the converter achieves a peak efficiency of 92.9% at a 20&#8211;2.2 V conversion ratio.</description></item><item><title>A Coupling-Adaptive Wireless Power Transfer System With Voltage-/Current-Mode Receiver and Global Digital-PWM Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693609</link><description>This article presents a 13.56-MHz wireless power transfer (WPT) system with coupling variation robustness and high efficiency for powering biomedical implantable devices (IMDs). To sustain reliable power transfer against inductive-link fluctuation, a hybrid voltage-/current-mode (V/CM) receiver (RX) is proposed to provide CM recovery when the coupling becomes weak for VM operation. To optimize the end-to-end (E2E) efficiency, a digital pulsewidth modulation (PWM)-based global power regulation technique is proposed, which allows a fully on/off operation of the three-mode power amplifier (PA) at the transmitter (TX) side and fast load-transient responses. Moreover, the system adopts a fully integrated voltage-sensing load-shift-keying (LSK) demodulation technique, which replaces conventional current sensing methods with a streamlined implementation and reduced power consumption. Both prototype TX and RX chips were fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process. The proposed system, powered by a 1.8-V supply at TX, realizes a regulated 1.8-V dc output at RX. With the help of the hybrid V/CM RX, the proposed system achieves an up-to-150% WPT range extension compared to VM-only operation and an up to 7.2-cm WPT range. Benefiting from the global digital-PWM regulation, it achieves up to 72.3% E2E efficiency over the loading range from 0.18 to 81 mW. A 10- $\mu $ s load-transient recovery is also attained at a  $164{\times }$  load step with a 110-mV undershoot and unnoticeable overshoots.</description></item><item><title>98.7% Efficiency 1200&#8211;48 V LLC Converter Using Triple Step-Down Converter With One-Inductor Technique Compliant With EVSE Level 1</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10628040</link><description>The proposed LLC flyback converter converts the 1200 V of the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) into a 48 V battery system. The triple step-down converter with one inductor (TSDC-OL) technique converts 1200&#8211;400 V, and the transformer steps it down to 48 V. The zero-voltage switching (ZVS) mechanism is used for each switching operation and the equivalent on-resistance  $R_{\text {ON}}$  is reduced to 1/4.5 times that of the existing technology. The proposed reference voltage compensator (RVC) can accurately maintain the charging current at 25 A. Since the left half-plane zero error amplifier (LZEA) contributes to the LHP zero, it ensures the stability of the RVC and prevents periodic variations. When the battery charges to 48 V, the operation switches to constant voltage (CV) mode via burst operation control (BOC) comparison with a leakage-based ultralow  $I_{Q}$  comparator (LUC) with 2 nA  $I_{Q}$  leakage. Finally, the proposed LLC flyback converter meets EVSE level 1 requirements in constant current (CC) mode and achieves 98.7% efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A 2.08-mW 64.4-dB SNDR 400-MS/s Pipelined- SAR ADC Using Mismatch and PVT Variation Tolerant Dynamically Biased Ring Amplifier in 8 nm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10710178</link><description>In this article, we introduce a new dynamically biased ring amplifier that is tolerant to mismatch and PVT variation without requiring bias calibration, and we verify it in a 12-bit 400-MS/s pipelined-SAR analog-to-digital converter (ADC), fabricated in an 8-nm FinFET process. Our novel ring amplifier solves the biasing issues inherent in conventional ring amplifiers while maintaining the benefits of high gain, slew-based charging, and nearly rail-to-rail output swing. We also propose a technique to enhance the DC accuracy of a switched-capacitor common-mode feedback (CMFB) without consuming additional power, which we named feedback voltage sampling CMFB. Furthermore, we introduce a full-scale matching residue amplification technique for the prototype pipelined-SAR ADC to utilize the top-plate input sampling for the first-stage SAR ADC, resulting in faster and lower power conversion. The prototype ADC demonstrates the robustness of our dynamically biased ring amplifier to mismatch and PVT variation without any interstage gain, bias, or reference calibration, and achieves 64.4-dB SNDR and 77.6-dB SFDR for a low-frequency input while consuming 2.08 mW. This measured performance is equivalent to Walden and Schreier FoMs of 3.8 fJ/conversion $\cdot $ step and 174.2 dB, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 12-GS/s 12-b 4&#215; Time-Interleaved ADC Using Input-Independent Timing Skew Calibration With Global Dither Injection and Linearized Input Buffer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747403</link><description>This article presents a 12-GS/s 12-bit  $4{\times }$  time-interleaved (TI) pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which utilizes a global dither injection (GDI) scheme to facilitate an input-independent background timing skew calibration. The GDI scheme adds dithers into the input signal of the push-pull source follower (PP-SF) in the input buffer (IBF), avoiding undetectable skews in conventional local dither injection (LDI) schemes. Meanwhile, the perturbations between the input signal and dither are mitigated by cross-coupled capacitive networks. This work also significantly improves the efficiency of the interleaver using the following techniques: first, the PP-SF-based IBF is linearized by a self-adaptive current compensation (SACC), achieving high linearity under 1.2-V low supply voltage headroom. Second, the speed of the 12-bit channel is lifted to 3 GS/s in 28-nm CMOS using a sturdy ring amplifier (SRingAmp) with feedforward (FF), which enables a nonhierarchical interleaver with a small interleaving factor of  $4{\times }$ . The time-interleaved ADC attains a 54.1-dB SNDR and a 66.0-dB SFDR under a near-Nyquist input with 179.8-mW power consumption, translating into a Walden figure of merit (FoM) of 36.2 fJ/conversion step and a Schreier FoM of 159.3 dB.</description></item><item><title>A &#8722;90-dBFS-IM3, &#8722;164-dBFS/Hz-NSD, 700-MHz-Bandwidth Continuous-Time Pipelined ADC With Digital Cancellation of DAC Errors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715661</link><description>This paper describes a continuous-time (CT) pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that represents a technology push along both&#8212;third-order distortion and noise&#8212;dimensions. Distortion is tackled using on-chip digital cancellation of static and timing digital-to-analog converter (DAC) mismatch errors. Low noise is achieved with design choices such as a resistive sub-DAC; a high-precision, on-chip, background-calibrated digital reconstruction filter (DRF); and a tunable LC lattice delay that allows a programmable sampling frequency. Implemented in a 16-nm FinFET process, the 6.4-GS/s prototype achieves an IM3 of &#8722;90 dBFS and a small-signal NSD of &#8722;164 dBFS/Hz over a 700-MHz bandwidth, while dissipating 703-mW power. Such performance makes it suitable for high-performance instrumentation and communications that demand robustness to large interferers while digitizing small signals.</description></item><item><title>Implementation of Linear Differential Equations Using Pulse-Coupled Oscillators With an Ultra-Low Power Neuromorphic Realization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10697267</link><description>Pulse-coupled oscillators (PCOs) are used as models for oscillatory systems in diverse fields such as biology, physics, and engineering. When correctly coupled, PCOs can display sophisticated emergent dynamics for a large number of oscillators. Here, we propose an algorithm and hardware implementation of PCOs to emulate arbitrary systems of linear differential equations (DEs) with inputs, which are similar to the equations used in feedback control laws or linearizations of nonlinear systems. We show that m populations of oscillators can solve a set of m-dimensional linear DEs with simple coupling schemes, and crucially, without the matrix multiplications required in Euler integration. The emergence of linear dynamical systems in networks of PCOs occurs when the number of oscillators within a population becomes large, as demonstrated through an analytically exact mean-field derivation. In addition, a hardware architecture of PCOs for digital implementation is proposed and realized on an ultra-low power FPGA as a proof of concept. These results show that there are simple coupling schemes for pulse-coupled oscillator networks that collectively compute complex dynamical systems. These PCO networks also have an immediate implementation as low power neuromorphic edge devices.</description></item><item><title>A 701.7 TOPS/W Compute-in-Memory Processor With Time-Domain Computing for Spiking Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10734367</link><description>Artificial neural networks have led to a higher computational burden, complicating inference tasks on low-power edge devices. Spiking neural network (SNN), which leverages sparse spikes for computation and data transmission, is an effective energy-efficient computing technique. However, the length of spike sequences in SNN varies significantly depending on the input coding method, among which rate coding still results in substantial data movement. A highly energy-efficient SNN accelerator with a time-domain CIM processor is proposed with three key features: 1) time-domain bitcell array for high linearity with lower energy, reducing 58.6% power consumption compared to inverter-chain architecture, 2) time-domain multi-bit accumulate for assisting multi-bit weights without analog-to-digital converter, achieving 47.2% energy reduction of domain-conversion energy, 3) analog precision reconstruction unit for supporting phase coding.

Coincidence detection can suppress the ambient light at the cost of the lateral resolution. A  $64\times 64$  SPAD image sensor with coincidence detection is proposed for Lidar. A main-sub time-to-digital converter (TDC), in which the main TDC is used for timestamping the coincidence window and the sub-TDC is used for timestamping the event within the coincidence window, is proposed to avoid the loss of the lateral resolution at a small power cost. A delay-locked loop (DLL) is adopted to generate an analog voltage for maintaining the length of the coincidence window against process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations. A TDC code correction circuit is proposed to reduce the probability of TDC inter-segment errors to 0.7%. The SPAD image sensor is based on the 3D integration of a SPAD array with a ROIC. The ROIC chip is fabricated in a  $0.18\mu $ m CMOS process. Driven by a 250 MHz multi-phase clock and a 100 MHz data readout clock, the chip achieves a maximum frame rate of 35.7 kframe/s, a timing resolution of 0.5 ns, and a timing range of  $2\mu $ s. The typical average power consumption of the ROIC is 135.5 mW (@21.7 kframes/s).

Furthermore, it allows higher maximum stable amplitude (MSA), achieves reduced jitter sensitivity, and relaxes the dynamic requirements on the DSM loop-filter (LF). However, MB quantization adds a dominant source of non-linearity due to element mismatch in the MB digital-to-analog converter (DAC) which often dominates the performance. State of the art (SoA) presents many calibration techniques, though digital power and area consumption can be high and calibration time be significant. In this paper we target a calibration-free DAC based on dual quantization and propose to employ a Multistage noise SHaping (MASH) Digital-DSM (DDSM) to avoid architectural compromises between the main DSM LF and the DDSM DAC. The implementation trade-offs are illustrated, and stability constraints in both the main LF and the DDSM are addressed. An exemplary implementation is derived and simulated, and the results shall lay the foundation for future circuit implementations of MASH DDSM to realize MB DSM with intrinsically high linearity.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Design of Wideband Active Single-Sideband Time Modulator in 0.13- &#956;m CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681654</link><description>A wideband active single-sideband time modulator (STM) is proposed in this paper, which achieves high-resolution frequency-independent phase shifting performance through high-precision time delay, eliminating the need for calibrations. The analysis starts with N-step time modulation sequences for the active STM, followed by discussions on enhancing the sideband suppression ratio (SSR) and the effects of quadrature mismatch on SSR. The proposed active STM is based on a periodically controlled active vector modulator with regularly scalable gate-widths, and its timing sequences for control bits feature identical duty cycles and modulation frequency ( $f_{\mathrm {P}}$ ). For verification, a wideband active STM is implemented using 0.13- $\mu $ m CMOS technology, which is composed of an input balun and quadrature generator, a periodically controlled 4-bit active vector modulator and a variable-gain stage. Measurement results indicate root mean square (RMS) phase and gain errors ranging from 0.1 to 0.4&#176; and less than 0.2 dB respectively, within a 3-dB frequency range of 13.0 to 20.6 GHz at the maximum gain state.

The NLI can effectively boost high-frequency (HF) gain and extend HF bandwidth (BW) and also suppress latter-stages noise, which further improves the overall design trade-off among gain, BW, and noise figure (NF).

To facilitate the design, a novel design method is proposed for the CLLMBA to precisely control the load modulation and output power back-off (OBO) level by arranging the current ratio among the control amplifier (CA) and balanced amplifiers (BAs). Moreover, to further expand the working bandwidth, the coupled-line couplers are adopted in the CLLMBA. Subsequently, the physical dimensions and operating conditions of the three sub-amplifiers are selected accurately based on load modulation analysis at the fundamental frequency. It leads to properly modulated impedances and cancels the output matching networks for sub-amplifiers. Besides, meandering lange couplers are adopted by double metal layers and air-bridges for a compact layout. To validate the proposed techniques, a CLLMBA prototype is implemented and fabricated in a commercial 0.25- $\mu $ m GaN HEMT process with the die size of  $3.1\times 2.3$  mm2.

Furthermore, under a 100 MHz orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal with 8.5 dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), the average DE is 32.8%-40.6% and the adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) after digital predistortion is better than &#8722;47.5 dBc.</description></item><item><title>Benchmarking of Scaled Majority-Logic-Synthesized Spintronic Circuits Based on Magnetic Tunnel Junction Transducers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623899</link><description>It is envisaged that spintronic logic devices will ultimately be utilized in hybrid CMOS-spintronic systems where signal interconversion between magnetic and electrical domains via transducers takes place. This underscores the vital role of transducers in influencing the overall performance of such hybrid systems. This paper addresses the question: Can spintronic circuits based on Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ) transducers outperform their state-of-the-art CMOS counterparts? To this end, we use the EPFL (&#201;cole Polytechnique F&#233;d&#233;rale de Lausanne) combinational benchmark sets, synthesize them in 7 nm CMOS and in MTJ transducer based spintronic technologies, and compare the two implementation methods in terms of Energy-Delay-Product (EDP). To fully utilize the technologies&#8217; potential, CMOS and spintronic implementations are built upon standard Boolean and Majority Gates, respectively. For the spintronic circuits, we assumed that domain conversion (electric/magnetic to magnetic/electric) is performed by means of MTJs and the computation is accomplished by domain wall (DW)-based majority gates, and considered two EDP estimation scenarios: (i) Uniform Benchmarking, which ignores the circuit&#8217;s internal structure and only includes domain transducers&#8217; power and delay contributions into the calculations, and (ii) Majority-Inverter-Graph Benchmarking, which also embeds the circuit structure, the associated critical path delay and energy consumption by DW propagation. Our results indicate that, for the uniform case, the spintronic route is better suited for the implementation of complex circuits with few inputs and outputs. On the other hand, when the circuit structure is also considered via majority and inverter synthesis, our analysis clearly indicates that in order to match and eventually outperform CMOS performance, MTJ transducers&#8217; efficiency has to be improved by 3-4 orders of magnitude. While it is clear that for the time being the MTJ-based-spintronic way cannot compete with CMOS, further technological transducer developments may tip the balance, which, when combined with information non-volatility, may make spintronic implementation for certain applications that require a large number of calculations and have a rather limited amount of interaction with the environment.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Asymmetric Outphasing Power Amplifier With Extended Back-Off Range for 5G Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747518</link><description>5G and future 6G wireless communication systems are pushing the practical limits on the modulation schemes that can be achieved in practice. These higher-level modulation schemes have further exacerbated the challenges in power amplifier (PA) design. One solution to linearly and efficiently amplify these modulation schemes that have high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs), is to use dual-input Outphasing PAs (OPAs). However, the output back-off (OBO) range of a conventional OPA is limited. To mitigate this issue, a new OPA based on an asymmetric architecture is proposed. This new asymmetric OPA is shown theoretically that the OBO range can be extended. To validate the proposal, an OPA is designed using two asymmetric sub-PAs and a modified Chireix combiner.

An ultra-compact 90&#176; coupler employing a three-dimensional (3-D) coupling structure achieves a 70% reduction in size compared to typical Lange couplers while maintaining excellent performance. This 3-D 90&#176; coupler enables the synthesis/distribution of IF I-Q signals within the transceiver (TRX), enhancing the feasibility of mmWave DBF by reducing the demand for baseband channels and facilitating scalability for multi-beam arrays. To ensure a low-level error vector magnitude (EVM) in the TRX, the chipset employs joint package design for optimal power and noise performance. It utilizes an image-reject mixer to suppress RX image noise and introduces a DC-offset in the single-sideband up-converter for LO leakage regulation. Additionally, a frequency doubler chain is incorporated to enhance phase noise performance. Fabricated using 0.13- $\mu $ m SiGe BiCMOS technology and packaged in WLCSP process, the TX achieves an average output 1-dB compression point ( $OP_{1dB}$ ) of 20 dBm per channel. The RX chip features a minimum noise figure (NF) of 3.4 dB. Over-the-air (OTA) measurements conducted over a 1.1-m distance reveal a transmission data rate of up to 8 Gb/s using 16-QAM modulation at 25 GHz. Furthermore, when employing a 400-MHz 64-QAM 5G New Radio (NR) modulation, the system maintains EVM levels below -33 dB at 25 GHz and below -30 dB over 24-29.5 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A Half-Schmitt Trigger-Based 9T1R Nonvolatile Robust SRAM Cell for Instant On-Off Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10786229</link><description>This article proposes a novel design of 9T1R nonvolatile static random access memory (nvSRAM). The proposed nvSRAM cell significantly improves critical performance metrics such as static noise margin, read-delay, break-even time (BET), and store/restore delay/energy. Schmitt trigger action is enabled during read to mitigate read disturb problem and improve read static noise margin. A resistive random access memory (RRAM) device is used intelligently to store/restore data in a single cycle. The technique reduces the store and restore delay by 50% and 25% compared to its nearest competitor nvSRAM. The Monte-Carlo simulations demonstrate a very reliable read/write operation with lower variability ( $\sigma /\mu $ ) and improved effective mean ( $\mu - 3\sigma $ ) compared to existing nvSRAMs. The Worst-case corner analysis under extreme temperatures confirms the robustness of the design in face of PVT variations. The proposed design incurs only 40% area overhead as compared to 6T cell, which is much smaller than several other existing nvSRAMs. A new figure of merit that comprehensively captures cell-stability, write-ability, read/write/store/restore delay &amp; power dissipation of an nvSRAM cell is also proposed. Based on this metric, it is observed that the proposed cell outperforms all of the nvSRAM cells considered in this work. Array simulations for a 1Mb nvSRAM at both typical and slow process corners demonstrate minimal store/restore delay overheads and favorable access times, supporting its suitability for applications requiring instant on-off functionality.</description></item><item><title>A High-Speed, Low-Power, High-Reliability and Fully Single Event Double Node Upset Tolerant Design for Magnetic Random Access Memory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10633793</link><description>Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM) has enormous application potential in the aerospace field due to its nonvolatile, high speed, low power, and inherent radiation resistance characteristics. Due to its high sensing reliability, pre-charge differential sense amplifier (PCDSA) has been proposed and widely used in MRAM products. However, such PCDSA is based on traditional CMOS technology, and as the size of CMOS technology continues to shrink, its sensing result is easily affected by single event upset (SEU) or even the single event double node upset (SEDU). Recently, a TSC-PCDSA has been proposed to fully tolerate SEDU. However, it still suffers from slow speed, high power consumption and low reliability during normal sense operation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel PCDSA circuit that uses 6 three-input approximate C-elements (TACs) and 2 three-input standard C-elements (TSCs) to provide SEDU-tolerance. By reducing the number of transistors on the discharge path and increasing the difference in discharge current, the proposed PCDSA can achieve high speed, low power and high reliability. By using a physics-based STT-MTJ compact model and a commercial CMOS 40 nm design kit, hybrid simulations have been performed to demonstrate its functionality and evaluate its performance. Simulation results show that when the TMR is 150%, the width of N1-N12 is 480 nm and the  $\text {V}_{\text {DD}}$  is 1.1 V, the proposed PCDSA sensing error rate (SER) is close to 0% during normal sense operation, achieving a high sense speed of 123.6 ps and a low sense energy of 1.6533 fJ. Compared with the previously proposed TSC-PCDSA, the sense reliability is greatly improved, and the sense time and sense energy are reduced by 1.84 times and 1.27 times, respectively. Moreover, the proposed PCDSA can fully tolerate SEDU by optimizing the layout design. In the worst case where deposited charge  $Q_{\text {inj}}$  is 2 pC, it can achieve a shorter recover time of 1.28244 ns and a lower recover energy dissipation of 2.1604 pJ than the previously proposed TSC-PCDSA.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Quantization Schemes to Increase Accuracy, Reduce Area, and Lower Power Consumption in FFT Architectures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596051</link><description>This paper explores new advanced quantization schemes for fast Fourier transform (FFT) architectures.

To achieve this, we have analyzed the mathematical operations carried out in FFT architectures and explored the changes that benefit all the figures of merit. By combining or alternating truncation and rounding, and using the half-unit biased (HUB) representation in the different computations of the architecture, we have achieved quantization schemes that increase accuracy, reduce area, and lower power consumption simultaneously. This win-win result improves multiple figures of merit without worsening any other, making it a valuable strategy to optimize FFT architectures.</description></item><item><title>HRCIM-NTT: An Efficient Compute-in-Memory NTT Accelerator With Hybrid-Redundant Numbers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10700038</link><description>Recently, four NIST-approved Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms are selected to be standardized. Three of them are lattice-based cryptographic schemes and feature the number-theoretic transform (NTT) as the computing bottleneck compelling fast and low-power hardware implementations. In this work, a high-speed and power-efficient NTT accelerator is presented leveraging the compute-in-memory (CIM) technique with bottom-up optimizations. Firstly, a carry-free modular multiplication (CFMM) algorithm is proposed, which utilizes on-the-fly reduction and hybrid-redundant representation to optimize the butterfly unit operation, the cornerstone of NTT. Based on the optimized algorithm, an efficient butterfly unit in memory (BUIM) is developed by co-designing with SRAM circuit, which saves the memory access energy, decreases operation cycles, and obtains ultra-short critical path. Additionally, the data pattern of CIM array is also improved to avoid redundant memory read/write operations, which further reduces memory access overhead. Finally, a combination of pipelined operation flow and constant interstage data mapping strategy is employed to bestow the proposed hybrid-redundant CIM NTT (HRCIM-NTT) architecture with minimized computing cycles and reduced routing overhead. The implementation under 45nm CMOS technology demonstrates that HRCIM-NTT achieves the highest throughput and lowest latency among the existing CIM-based NTT accelerators.</description></item><item><title>Fanout-Based Reliability Model for SER Estimation in Combinational Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10683731</link><description>Soft errors in Integrated Circuits (ICs) have always been a major concern, particularly as CMOS technology nodes continue to shrink, resulting in higher frequency, lower power, and smaller areas, exacerbating radiation-induced soft errors. Therefore, Single Event Transient (SET) has become a crucial consideration in designing modern radiation-tolerant circuits, as it has the potential to cause failures in circuit outputs. This paper employs the concept of signal probability for transient fault propagation in circuits. Considering the issue of transient fault-masking, an error propagation model is presented for each fault-masking case. Furthermore, approaches are proposed for both probabilistic and time-based scenarios to address the impact of re-convergent paths on transient error propagation. Since considering re-convergent paths increases computational complexity, three computational algorithms are proposed in this paper aiming to reduce the size of the probability matrix as much as possible. We compared the simulation results with the Monte-Carlo method and HSPICE-based simulation to validate the proposed method. According to the simulation results on ISCAS&#8217;85 benchmarks, the proposed approach for estimating the single event rate exhibits an average relative error percentage of less than 5% compared to traditional fault injection estimation.</description></item><item><title>Inverse Proportional Chaotification Model for Image Encryption in IoT Scenarios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10790858</link><description>In Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, the limited computing resources and energy constraints of devices, alongside the growing demand for real-time applications, make secure image transmission challenging. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight image encryption scheme based on chaotic map. Firstly, a new 3-D inverse proportional chaotic map (3D-IPCM) is designed with good robustness. Dynamics confirms that it possesses key characteristics, including a broad and continuous chaotic range, all positive Lyapunov exponents (LEs), high permutation entropy (PE) complexity and even distribution. Then, a new pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) is designed based on this map, which successfully passes all NIST and TestU01 tests, even with 16-bit calculation precision. Next, this PRNG is employed for image encryption in IoT scenarios. In the cryptosystem, a chromosome crossover (CC)-based scrambling algorithm is proposed, along with a diffusion algorithm that achieves strong resistance to differential attack in just two rounds of row diffusion. Simulation and analysis verify that the cryptosystem has strong resistance to common attacks and low cost. For  $256 \times 256$  images, its average number of pixels change rate (NPCR) and unified average changing intensity (UACI) are 100% and 33.40%, respectively, and the encryption time is only 7.4 ms. Ultimately, we implement the algorithm on FPGA, thus confirming its capacity for parallel acceleration.</description></item><item><title>A 3-D Multi-Precision Scalable Systolic FMA Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758343</link><description>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has almost become the default approach in a wide range of applications, such as computer vision, chatbots, and natural language processing. These AI-based applications require computing large-scale data with sufficient precision, typically in floating-point numbers, within a limited time window. A primary target for AI acceleration is matrix multiplication, mainly involving dot products through Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations. Current research employs the Fused Multiply-Add (FMA) operation, based on IEEE-754 Floating Point (FP) standard, to meet these requirements. However, current research focuses more on simplifying the internal digital circuits of the Processing Elements (PEs) performing FMA operations, rather than optimizing the FMA process specifically for MAC tasks. Current PE arrays often use a two-dimensional (2-D) systolic array design, without specific optimization for MAC operations, thus their parallelism is not fully utilized. Additionally, these designs lack reconfigurability and flexibility, leading to suboptimal performance on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). Moreover, some designs adopt lower precision computing in AI inference for higher performance. However, some AI models still rely on high-precision computing to maintain the accuracy. Thus, multi-precision computing is commonly used in AI accelerators. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel Multi-Fused Multiply-Accumulate (MFMA) scheme and a corresponding three-dimensional (3-D) scalable systolic FP computing architecture. The MFMA scheme addresses the problem of the classical FMA scheme. It optimizes FMA for MAC operations with the Fused Multiply-Accumulate (FMAC) operation. Also, it combines multi-precision and mixed-precision FP computing methods for higher accuracy and lower overflow error. The proposed architecture integrates two 2-D systolic arrays into the PE for a 3-D systolic array, achieving higher parallelism and flexibility. The proposed scalable architecture can be customized to suit various FMAC operations. Compared with existing state-of-the-art FP architectures on FPGAs, our proposed architecture achieves 47%, 10%, and 159% energy efficiency improvements in FP32, FP16, and INT8 operations, respectively. Furthermore, our proposed architecture achieves energy efficiency improvements of 105%, 54%, and 262% under efficiency saturation conditions, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art design.</description></item><item><title>Various Dynamics of Amplitude Regulation Within a Class of 3D Rulkov Neurons</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10633814</link><description>Chaotic behavior can be improved through specific types of nonlinear feedback, thereby offering profound insights into chaos control. In this work, a class of nonlinear functions is utilized as feedback to explore the various dynamics of amplitude regulation in the modified 3D Rulkov neurons, thereby changing its brain-like firing patterns. Three different functions are embedded in Rulkov neurons for the outcome of complex dynamics, including the amplitude and frequency control of firing oscillation. Specifically, the pumping effect from a neuron parameter is analyzed, where the energy and amplitude of the firing are almost linearly rescaled by the input acting as a pivotal element for enhancing the transmission of neural signals. Furthermore, when the nonlinear feedback is obtained from a periodic function, coexisting double-scroll phase orbits induced by the initially-controlled offset boosting are arranged in phase space with the same shape and different amplitude. Finally, the digital circuit implemented by CH32 is carried out to verify complex firings. The Pseudo-Random Number Generator is employed as the technology to show the complexity of chaotic firing.</description></item><item><title>Interdependence Among Voltage-Unstable Buses During Cascading Failure in Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10595500</link><description>In this paper, we demonstrate the interdependence among buses in power systems that experience voltage instability events by deriving interaction graphs through successive transition probability matrices and the Markov transition matrix. A quasi-stationary convergence has been observed in the probability transition matrices, suggesting a pattern in voltage instability failure. We propose algorithms to identify the pattern, referred to as fault chains, by tracing the interaction graphs. The interaction graphs and fault chains can be used to formulate strategies for enhancing network robustness, including the assignment of new photovoltaic buses, load rescheduling, and equipping droop controllers. Numerical experiments performed on the IEEE 118- and 300-bus systems demonstrate that equipping droop controllers at selected buses is an effective approach for improving network robustness.</description></item><item><title>Differentiable Cost Model for Neural-Network Accelerator Regarding Memory Hierarchy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10723092</link><description>Dedicated neural-network inference-processors improve latency and power of the computing devices. They use custom memory hierarchies that take into account the flow of operators present in neural networks and convolutional layers. For efficient implementation, such network topologies can greatly benefit from hardware-cost optimization using automated network-architecture search. Thereby, cost functions predict the suitability of a network topology for a given type of inference hardware. A differentiable neural-architecture search that optimizes both weights and topology in a single training requires cost models to be differentiable in the dimensions of weight and activation matrices. State-of-the-art differentiable cost models require time-consuming system-level measurements or simulation results, or do not encounter the hardware structure at all. This work presents a simple yet effective procedure for deriving a differentiable neural-network-accelerator cost-model that is suitable for any type of accelerator. It is based on hardware-independent parameterization and a novel differentiable divide-ceil function, as well as hardware-specific modeling. The resulting differentiable model can be reconfigured to the actual hardware size and memory structure to predict the inference energy for an exact network topology. The modeling and prediction are demonstrated for a state-of-the-art SRAM-based inference-accelerator and for the Eyeriss accelerator, inferring different state-of-the-art neural networks, resulting in excellent agreement with measured hardware.</description></item><item><title>A 36-Gb/s 1.6-pJ/b PAM-3 Transmitter Leveraging Digital Logic Cells and 4-Tap FFE in 22-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777857</link><description>The first 36-Gb/s transmitter with differential outputs leveraging the three-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-3) and digital logic cells is investigated in this study.

However, the fast changing wireless channel makes the ideal power allocation be a challenging task in practice. A chaotic shape-forming filter (CSF) based NOMA system is proposed and a deep learning (DL) based method is used to estimate the user channel gains for power allocation in this paper. The contributions of the work lie in: 1) The CSF and the corresponding matched filter (MF) enhance the noise resistance performance of the NOMA system. 2) The autocorrelation function (ACF) of the superposition signal composed by the chaotic signals generated by the CSF of different users is proved to be the same as the ACF of the base function of the CSF, which is an interesting and important base point to use the previous theoretical result for blind channel identification. 3) For the flat fading channel assumed in the NOMA system, an analytical formula of the channel gain, sole parameter in this type of the channel, with respect to the ACFs of the received signal and the base function of the CSF is derived for the first time, which provides the underlying mechanism to use deep neural network (DNN) for channel gain prediction. Simulation results show that 1) the chaos-based NOMA using the CSF and corresponding MF achieves better performance as compared to the conventional binary phase shift keying NOMA (BPSK-NOMA) with root-raised cosine (RRC) filter; 2) the DNN with simplified structure and the less input neuron as compared to that for the frequency selective fading channel is capable of achieving superior performance for both blind channel identification and NOMA system in the sense of low bit error rate (BER).</description></item><item><title>High-Throughput LDPC Decoder for Multiple Wireless Standards</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665929</link><description>It is a great challenge to design an LDPC decoder with multi-standard compatibility, flexibility and low silicon overhead.

Affected by magnetic fields, control strategies and compensation networks, parameters detuning inevitably lead to the loss of ZPA input. Fractional-order circuits are concerned in wireless power transfer (WPT) system due to a higher degree of freedom.

In this paper, an augmented DC-DC buck converter consisting of a lower-frequency main converter and a normally-off fast-switching secondary stage operating in parallel is proposed. The main-stage of the converter uses emulated-current-mode hysteretic control. For the auxiliary transient-suppression stage a nonlinear control scheme termed multiple-single-cycle nonlinear control (MSCNLC) is developed. The proposed augmented regulator improves the load transient response without compromising the overall efficiency of the converter, breaking the well-known efficiency vs. dynamic response trade-off. The high power-efficiency main-stage operating at  $F_{sw}=500$  kHz provides the steady-state DC regulation voltage. The auxiliary-stage adopts a small inductor of 100nH and is only activated when load transient events are detected, providing fast load response, minimizing output voltage deviation. The load transient events are detected through an output capacitor charge tracking circuit, which effectively makes the auxiliary-stage a fast Current-Controlled-Current-Source during transient response. The buck converter is designed for  $V_{IN} =3$  V-5.5V,  $V_{OUT} =0.5$  V-1.1V and  $I_{LOAD} =0.5$  A-8A. It is fabricated in  $0.18~\mu $  m BCD process.

The recovery time is improved by ~1.7x.</description></item><item><title>Power System Frequency Estimation With Zero Response Time Under Abrupt Transients</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659053</link><description>The methods based on Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) are the mainstream approaches for frequency estimation of signals in power systems. However, they exhibit unfavorable long response times when confronted with signals experiencing abrupt transients, such as amplitude or phase step changes. To surmount this challenge, a novel methodology leveraging the DFT has been designed to estimate power system signals with accuracy and responsiveness under abrupt transient conditions. The method first constructs the correlation between DFT bins and each parameter. The relationship is then harnessed to derive an unbiased estimator for sine-wave with a known step position. Afterward, we introduce a step position estimation procedure that guarantees the robustness of the estimator when dealing with abrupt transients. As a result, the proposed method achieves zero response time when confronted with arbitrary abrupt transients without loss of accuracy. The effectiveness and responsiveness of our method are evaluated through simulations that adhere to the stringent requirements of P-class phasor measurement units.</description></item><item><title>A Frequency Synthesizer With Automatic Frequency Calibration Robust to Initial Phase Error and Phase-Noise Enhanced Ring Oscillator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10705121</link><description>An automatic frequency calibration robust to initial phase error and a phase-noise-enhanced ring oscillator are proposed for frequency synthesizers. The proposed automatic frequency calibration method can quickly determine the desired sub-band tuning curve for a voltage-controlled oscillator by detecting the overshoot voltage of the oscillator control voltage of the frequency synthesizer when an initial phase error occurs between the reference signal and the divided output signal from the oscillator, thereby reducing the locking time of the frequency synthesizer.

In light current loads, only the folded cascode amplifier is opened to provide excellent output voltage accuracy while reducing power consumption. In heavy current loads, activating the operational transconductance amplifier improves transient performance. An adaptive pole-tracking technique has been applied in the proposed LDO to ensure loop stability. In addition, a low-power bandgap reference was embedded into the proposed LDO, which simplifies the peripheral circuit of LDO in practical application.

Specifically, the power and forward data are transferred through inductive coupling respectively by means of the DD coils and Q coils, while the backward data is transferred through capacitive coupling by means of the stray capacitances. Because of the decoupling characteristic of the DDQ coil structure and the use of two coupling types, the interferences among the power, forward data, and backward data are relatively low. By integrating the two coupling types, a comprehensive circuit model of full-duplex data transfer is established and analyzed. Finally, a 145-W prototype is actualized with 91.4% power transfer efficiency. The forward and backward data transfer rates are 150 kbps and 600 kbps, respectively, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed system.</description></item><item><title>A Peak-Valley Current-Mode Buck Converter With 3% to 95% Duty Cycle</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10729223</link><description>A peak-valley current-mode (PVCM) Buck converter is presented to extend the duty cycle range.

The proposed IIB converter has two inductor current paths. The IIB converter provides majority of the load current through a current path composed of low voltage transistors and minority of the load current through the current path composed of high voltage transistors, which becomes further as voltage conversion ratio decreases. Therefore, the IIB converter reduces conduction loss as the voltage conversion ratio decreases, which is considerably important in low voltage applications. In addition, since this converter uses a flying capacitor network behind the inductor, it is invulnerable to the input voltage variation. The proposed converter has peak efficiencies of 90.7% at  ${\mathrm { V}}_{\mathrm { IN}} {=} 12$  V,  ${\mathrm { V}}_{\mathrm { O}} {=} 0.6$  V, and 85.6% at  ${\mathrm { V}}_{\mathrm { IN}} {=} 12$  V,  ${\mathrm { V}}_{\mathrm { O}} {=} 0.3$  V. The chip was fabricated in 130-nm BCD process with an area of 6.177 mm2.</description></item><item><title>Source Number Estimation in 2D Uniform Circular and L-Shaped Arrays With Unknown Nonuniform Noise</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10730800</link><description>Classical source number estimators are usually derived under the assumption of uniform white noise, which may degrade substantially with unknown nonuniform sensor noise. Advanced estimators designed for nonuniform noise are however computationally expensive with limited performance in unfavorable conditions, such as low signal-to-noise ratio, small number of snapshots, close angular separations and sources with different transmitter powers. This brief proposes a new likelihood ratio statistics-based method for source number estimation under uncorrelated nonuniform noise. Using the asymptotic theory, it is shown that the likelihood ratio follows a chi-square distribution. Hence, the number of sources can be estimated via a sequence of hypothesis tests using maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) of the covariance matrix with different assumed source numbers. The low complexity subspace algorithm is proposed to obtain the ML estimates. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed estimator is consistent in the general asymptotic regime. Simulation results on 2D arrays such as uniform circular and L-shaped arrays show that the proposed estimator achieves a higher correct detection probability in unfavorable conditions and is more robust against nonuniformity of noise than state-of-the-art estimators.</description></item><item><title>Approximate DCT and Quantization Techniques for Energy-Constrained Image Sensors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609963</link><description>Recent expansions in multimedia devices for many applications, such as surveillance, self-driving cars, and healthcare, gather enormous amounts of real-time images for processing and inference. The images are first compressed using compression schemes, like joint photographics experts group (JPEG), before processing to reduce storage costs and additional power requirements for transmitting the captured data in this era of emerging ultra-wideband communication and human-body communication. The JPEG algorithm realizes image compression using simplistic matrix manipulations, making it preferable for hardware implementations. Furthermore, due to inherent error resilience and imperceptibility in images, JPEG can be approximated to reduce the required computation/processing power and area. This work demonstrates the first end-to-end approximation computing-based optimization of JPEG hardware using 1) an approximate division realized using bit-shift operators to reduce the complexity of the computationally intensive quantization block; 2) loop perforation; and 3) precision scaling on top of a multiplier-less fast discrete cosine transform (DCT) architecture to achieve an extremely energy-efficient JPEG compression unit which will be a perfect fit for power/bandwidth-limited scenario. Furthermore, a gradient descent-based heuristic composed of two conventional approximation strategies, i.e., precision scaling and loop perforation, is implemented for tuning the degree of approximation to tradeoff energy consumption with the quality degradation of the decoded image. The entire register-transfer level (RTL) design is coded in Verilog HDL, synthesized using the industry-standard tool, mapped to TSMC 65nm CMOS technology, and simulated using Cadence Spectre Simulator under 25 &#176; C, typical/typical (TT) corner. The approximate division approach in the quantization block achieved around 28% reduction in the active design area. The heuristic-based approximation technique combined with accelerator optimization achieves a significant energy reduction of 36% for a minimal image quality degradation of 2% sum of absolute difference (SAD). Simulation results also show that the proposed architecture consumes 15 uW at the DCT and quantization stages to compress a colored 480-p image at 6 frames/s.</description></item><item><title>A Deep Investigation on Stealthy DVFS Fault Injection Attacks at DNN Hardware Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10591998</link><description>With increasing computation of various applications, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is gradually deployed on FPGAs to improve performance and save energy. However, its reliability and security have not been sufficiently evaluated, which incurs quite many concerns. In this article, we propose an evaluation framework for deep investigation of stealthy DVFS fault injection attacks on the state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs) deployed on modern FPGAs. The evaluation framework mainly consists of a DVFS attack striker and a time-to-digital converter (TDC)-based hardware profiler. Two modes of evaluation are derived, and their effectiveness is demonstrated on a platform composed of a SkyNet accelerator and three ImageNet models built on a Xilinx deep learning processor unit (DPU). Experimental results show that more than 99% detection accuracy loss can be measured targeting at all tested DNN models under prospective operation mode but without any performance degradation in frame per second (FPS). In our investigation of sensitive layer mode, more than 93% average accuracy loss with 84.7% fault probability can be measured on a single bundle of the SkyNet. We characterize the vulnerabilities of different DNN layers subject to DVFS attacks through leveraging the TDC-based hardware profiler to precisely control the timing of fault injection.</description></item><item><title>Intermittent OTA Code Update Framework for Tiny Energy Harvesting Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10569023</link><description>The widespread deployment of various tiny energy harvesting devices has facilitated the expansion of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, notably in remote and hard-to-reach areas. Once deployed, a critical limitation of these devices is their inability to adapt code to evolving environmental conditions or user requirements. This challenge primarily arises from frequent power interruptions during code updates in energy harvesting devices, unlike their battery-powered counterparts, which can lead to significant errors or system failures. In response, we have designed an innovative framework for facilitating intermittent over-the-air (OTA) code updates in tiny energy harvesting devices. Our approach incorporates Intermittent-aware Update Operations, including insert, modify, delete, and copy, tailored for a variety of update scenarios while accommodating intermittent power and resource constraints. Furthermore, We have designed a Fault-tolerant bootloader that enables the intermittent update capability. This advanced bootloader enables code updates without system reboots and ensures correct task resumption of both routine and update tasks. This not only conserves energy by reducing the need for repetitive reboots but also ensures consistent code updates despite frequent power failures. Additionally, our framework integrates an update-aware checkpointing mechanism to provide reliable backups for both routine tasks and update tasks. This proposed framework presents a general solution for enabling intermittent code updates in tiny energy harvesting devices. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing approaches under conditions of insufficient harvested energy.</description></item><item><title>LAHDC: Logic-Aggregation-Based Query for Embedded Hyperdimensional Computing Accelerator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10577666</link><description>With low complexity and robustness, hyperdimensional computing (HDC) has become a promising paradigm for edge-side applications. HDC employs hypervectors (generally with 2&#8211;10 K dimensions) to represent input samples, and performs logical operations in hyperdimensional space to complete perceptual tasks. Compared to deep neural network (DNN), HDC is more suitable for lightweight edge-side applications (i.e., speech, activity recognition), due to its low complexity and less computational scheduling. However, existing HDC&#8217;s querying process relies on trained class hypervectors, resulting in on-chip storage and transmission overhead which limits the application of ASIC-based or FPGA-based HDC accelerators in embedded systems. In this article, a logic-aggregation-based query method called LAHDC is proposed to eliminate such overhead. In addition, an ultratiny HDC accelerator design matching LAHDC is also proposed, as well as an automated tool to search for optimal structure and generate hardware design code. Experimental results show that, compared to existing ASIC-based HDC accelerators, the proposed design reduce the area/energy by more than 95%/80%.</description></item><item><title>CoaCAD: Correlation-Assisted Computer-Aided Design for Nonvolatile FPGAs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571563</link><description>Nonvolatile field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) offer advantages in terms of high logic density and near-zero leakage power when contrasted with conventional static random access memory-based FPGAs. However, they have a lifetime issue. To deal with this problem, a series of configuration files can be generated with various logical-to-physical mappings. This enables intensive writing to be distributed across different physical regions for wear leveling. Currently, the configuration files are independently generated, which is time consuming. In this article, we propose to investigate correlations and use them to assist the computer-aided design (CAD) flow to speed up the procedure of generating configuration files. First, we develop dynamic probabilities to drive the swapping of placement stage in CAD flow, so as to push components to locate appropriate positions quickly. Second, we design the congestion information inheritance strategy to adjust routing parameters in the routing stage, aiming to reduce the number of routing attempts. Evaluation shows that the proposed schemes can deliver 44.15% decrease in placement and routing runtime, while maintaining comparable performance and lifetime, when compared with existing strategies.</description></item><item><title>Technology Legalization and Optimization for Adiabatic Quantum-Flux Parametron</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10611739</link><description>Adiabatic quantum-flux parametron (AQFP) is an energy-efficient superconducting technology. Before physical design can be performed, AQFP technology mapping involves not only mapping logic into supported gate types but also legalizing the circuit to fulfill the technology-imposed constraints on path balancing and fanout branching by inserting buffer and splitter cells. These cells account for a significant amount of the circuit&#8217;s area, delay, as well as for increasing energy consumption. In this article, we 1) identify that the AQFP legalization problem is a scheduling problem; 2) propose linear-time depth-optimal scheduling and irredundant buffer insertion algorithms; 3) present heuristic optimization algorithms to further reduce buffer count; and 4) suggest an unsupervised design space exploration approach for AQFP technology mapping, mixing, and interleaving logic optimization and technology legalization. Experimental results show that our design space exploration, utilizing the proposed technology legalization and optimization flow, achieves 44% improvement on the energy-delay product compared to the state of the art.</description></item><item><title>Transferable Presynthesis PPA Estimation for RTL Designs With Data Augmentation Techniques</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10577671</link><description>In modern VLSI design flow, evaluating the quality of register-transfer level (RTL) designs involves time-consuming logic synthesis using electronic design automation tools, a process that often slows down early optimization. While recent machine learning (ML) solutions offer some advancements, they typically struggle with maintaining high accuracy across any given RTL design. In this work, we propose an innovative transferable presynthesis power, performance, and area (PPA) estimation framework named MasterRTL. It first converts the hardware description language code to a new bit-level design representation named the simple operator graph (SOG). By only adopting single-bit simple operators, this SOG proves to be a general representation that unifies different design types and styles. The SOG is also more similar to the target gate-level netlist, reducing the gap between the RTL representation and netlist. In addition to the new SOG representation, MasterRTL proposes new ML methods for the RTL-stage modeling of timing, power, and area separately. Compared with the state-of-the-art solutions, the experiment on a comprehensive dataset with 90 different designs shows accuracy improvement by 0.33, 0.22, and 0.15 in correlation for total negative slack (TNS), worst negative slack (WNS), and power, respectively. Besides the prediction of the synthesis results, MasterRTL also excels in accurately predicting layout-stage PPA based on the RTL designs and in adapting across different technology nodes and process corners. Furthermore, we investigate two effective data augmentation techniques: 1) a graph generation method and 2) a large language model (LLM)-based approach. Our results validate the effectiveness of the generated RTL designs in mitigating the data shortage challenges.</description></item><item><title>CyberRL: Brain-Inspired Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Network Intrusion Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10579883</link><description>Due to the rapidly evolving landscape of cybersecurity, the risks in securing cloud networks and devices are attesting to be an increasingly prevalent research challenge. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning that has demonstrated its ability to detect cyberattacks, as well as its potential to recognize new ones. Many of the popular RL algorithms at present rely on deep neural networks, which are computationally very expensive to train. An alternative approach to this class of algorithms is hyperdimensional computing (HDC), which is a robust, computationally efficient learning paradigm that is ideal for powering resource-constrained devices. In this article, we present CyberRL, a HDC algorithm for learning cybersecurity strategies for intrusion detection in an abstract Markov game environment. We demonstrate that CyberRL is advantageous compared to its deep learning equivalent in computational efficiency, reaching up to  $1.9{\times }$  speedup in training time for multiple devices, including low-powered devices. We also present its enhanced learning quality and superior defense and attack security strategies with up to  $12.8\times $  improvement. We implement our framework on Xilinx Alveo U50 FPGA and achieve approximately  $700\times $  speedup and energy efficiency improvements compared to the CPU execution.</description></item><item><title>DiMO-CNN: Deep Learning Toolkit-Accelerated Analytical Modeling and Optimization of CNN Hardware and Dataflow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599531</link><description>The growing complexity of CNNs demands both hardware acceleration design and dataflow mapping solutions.

However, the diversification of the HI supply chain has led to several sources of distrust due to the use of black-boxed third-party intellectual property (IP), outsourced fabrication, assembly and test facilities during the design and manufacturing process. We demonstrate the susceptibility of chiplet IPs to timing failure due to voltage droop in the power distribution network (PDN) induced by the insertion of chiplet level ring-oscillator (RO)-based hardware Trojans. We present an end-to-end methodology for design, placement, and insertion of RO-based Trojans in chiplet designs followed by characterizing their contribution to the dynamic voltage droop induced within the on-chip PDN. We quantify this PDN impact on timing paths and develop a systematic method to rank the susceptibility of different data paths toward a voltage droop event. We utilize this presilicon security analysis framework to evaluate voltage droop-based attack susceptibility for a variety of IPs, including some from the CEP benchmark. We also develop a machine learning-guided time-series anomaly detection framework to detect voltage droop-based anomalies on functional workloads running on different benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of an convolutional autoencoders in detecting voltage droop-induced timing anomalies.</description></item><item><title>PETRA: Powerful Early Termination-Based Redundancy Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10587206</link><description>In dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), memory redundancy analysis (RA) is a crucial process for enhancing memory yield and reducing production costs. It finds a memory repair solution by efficiently allocating the limited number of spare cell lines that replace a faulty cell. However, it is challenging to quickly find a memory repair solution because RA is an NP-complete problem. To address this issue more effectively, we present a powerful early termination-based high-speed RA method. This method rapidly assesses memory repairability, terminating the RA process early in cases where repair is impossible, or a solution can be easily found. Additionally, by dividing faulty cells into several groups, the proposed RA method finds fast and approximate albeit nonoptimal solution sets for each group. This facilitates the rapid acquisition of a memory repair solution without the need to search for all the optimal solution sets. These features enable RA to be promptly executed while ensuring the repair solution for any repairable memory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RA method can find a repair solution faster than the existing RA methods.</description></item><item><title>NoCFuzzer: Automating NoC Verification in UVM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10601229</link><description>Network on chip (NoC) has surfaced as a crucial interconnection strategy in modern digital systems, thereby demanding meticulous verification. Due to its multiple nodes and high concurrency, verifying an NoC is labor-intensive, making it complex to generate a multitude of test cases. Recently, hardware fuzzing has been identified as a promising automated approach for hardware verification. However, when we tried to apply these fuzzing techniques to our internally developed NoC design, we discovered that they were incompatible with the specificities of NoC. Additionally, they are also incompatible with the standard IC verification workflow and universal verification methodology (UVM) environment. In this work, we aim to automate our verification process of NoC with fuzzing. We propose a fuzzing strategy specifically tailored for industrial NoC UVM verification. We employ fuzzing in NoC verification at multiple levels, including router verification, network verification, and stress testing. As a case study we apply our approach to an open-source NoC component in OpenPiton. Remarkably, our fuzzing methods automatically achieved complete code and functional coverage in the router and mesh network. We also effectively detect injected starvation bugs with fuzzing. The evaluation results clearly demonstrate the practicability of our fuzzing approach to considerably reduce the manpower required for test case generation compared with traditional NoC verification.</description></item><item><title>Cost Efficient Flip-Flop Designs With Multiple-Node Upset-Tolerance and Algorithm-Based Verifications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10592021</link><description>This article presents radiation-hardened flip-flop (FF) designs capable of tolerating soft errors, e.g., single-node upsets (SNUs), double-node upsets (DNUs) and multiple-node upsets (MNUs). First, a 2-input FF and a 3-input FF are proposed as the baseline FFs that not only, respectively, tolerate SNUs and DNUs but also exhibit cost efficiency in terms of delay, power, and area. Through adding two stages of c-elements, a 4-input FF and a 5-input FF are proposed as the baseline FFs as well. Utilizing the structural characteristics of these FFs, an  $N-1$  input FF and an N input FF are proposed as the extended FFs capable of tolerating more node upsets. Moreover, a highly efficient algorithm for verifying MNU-tolerance of these FFs is proposed. Algorithm and HSPICE-tool-based verification results both demonstrate the MNU-tolerance for the proposed FFs with more inputs.</description></item><item><title>An Energy Efficient Residual Spiking Neural Network Accelerator With Ternary Spikes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634969</link><description>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) use discrete binary spikes to transfer information between neurons, which is different from artificial neural networks (ANNs). Although event-based characteristics bring potential computation power and efficiency to SNNs, the long processing time window of discrete spikes leads to high latency. In this brief, a spike version of the residual network using ternary spikes is proposed. A shorter time window is required to achieve competitive performance because the ability to transfer information of the ternary spikes is strengthened. An SNN accelerator based on the proposed residual network with ternary spikes is designed and implemented with 28 nm CMOS technology, and the core area is 0.63 mm2. The proposed SNN accelerator achieves the classification accuracy of 92.07% on CIFAR-10 dataset with SResNet20 and only 6 time steps. The accelerator achieves 0.39 mJ energy consumption per frame with a throughput of 165.7 FPS when running at 500 MHz.</description></item></channel></rss>
