CCM model-based control methods suffer from degraded performance under such conditions, whereas hybrid model-based control methods are limited by complex mathematical formulations of logical variables, piecewise structures, and inequalities and high computational costs. This article proposes a state quadrant modeling approach, which includes circuit state classification and state descriptor construction, offering high-precision and simplifying models for model-based control. The circuit state classification method identifies circuit states based on freewheeling conditions and current trends, ensuring comprehensive coverage of operating scenarios and enhancing modeling accuracy. Furthermore, the state descriptor construction method employs logical operations to derive one or two logical variables that uniformly represent different circuit states, eliminating the need for inequalities and piecewise structures. This method is highly scalable and applicable to single-inductor, dual-inductor, multiphase, and isolated converters. It significantly enhances control performance, simplifies design, and improves computational efficiency when integrated into model-based control methods. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed models achieve 99.99% accuracy relative to simulink results and 98.99% accuracy relative to experimental results. They also reduce computation time by 36.85% in model predictive control and decrease voltage response time by 35.69%.</description></item><item><title>Multimodal Split-Bus Boost-LLC Resonant Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11204831</link><description>This article proposes a multimodal split-bus boost-LLC resonant converter suitable for wide-range applications. In the proposed topology, the bus of the conventional full-bridge LLC resonant converter is split. Specifically, the bus of the first half-bridge arm is directly connected to the input voltage source, while the bus of the second half-bridge arm is boosted by an integrated boost circuit formed by the boost inductor connected to the input voltage source and the second bridge arm. A fixed-frequency duty cycle control is applied to the second switching bridge arm to raise its bus voltage, thereby adjusting the equivalent input voltage of the resonant tank and modifying the voltage gain of the converter. In addition, through topological reconfiguration, the primary-side inverter bridge can transition from full-bridge mode to half-bridge mode, enabling the converter to achieve a fourfold voltage gain range. Finally, a 1-kW laboratory prototype with 400 V input and 200&#8211;800 V output voltage was developed. Experimental results show that the prototype achieved 97.5% peak efficiency under full-bridge LLC mode, which increased to 97.8% when operating in half-bridge LLC mode. The efficiency remained above 96.2% within the whole output voltage range under the rated output current.</description></item><item><title>Modulated Parameter-Less Predictive Voltage Control for Dual-Active-Bridge Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165003</link><description>Conventional model-based predictive voltage control in dual-active-bridge (DAB) converters suffers from voltage regulation limitations because the limited phase-shift angle candidate set impacts dynamic response and the parametric sensitivity impacts robustness. To address the above limitations, this letter proposes a modulated parameter-less predictive voltage control (MPL-PVC), where a parameter-less modeling architecture replaces the conventional mathematical models, eliminating dependence on precise circuit parameters through real-time parameter-less model updating, and a modulated optimal phase-shift angle calculation replaces conventional phase-shift angle candidate set, enhancing voltage regulation capacity while decoupling control performance from parametric variations. Experimental validation on a DAB prototype confirms the effectiveness of proposed MPL-PVC in enhancing dynamic performance and eliminating parametric effect.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Spatial Temperature Monitoring of Power Modules via Fourier Neural Operator-Based Thermal Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168963</link><description>Accurate monitoring of power module spatial temperature (PMST) remains a critical challenge in power electronics. This letter proposes a Fourier neural operator-based thermal model (FNO-TM) to enable efficient and precise prediction of PMST for the first time. Built on a data-driven paradigm, FNO-TM extracts spatial-frequency features, facilitating faster convergence and reduced training costs compared to conventional neural networks. To further enhance generalization, a Trunk-and-Branch architecture is employed to adapt to varying boundary conditions. In addition, an electrothermal coupling strategy tailored for FNO-TM is developed and validated on a practical inverter platform. Experimental results show that FNO-TM maintains high accuracy across different current levels and cooling conditions, with maximum errors below 1.8&#176;C. Furthermore, the PMST prediction is completed within 0.1 s, significantly outperforming traditional methods in computational efficiency. The prediction accuracy can be further enhanced through fine-tuning with measured data. These features make FNO-TM a promising solution for thermal monitoring and digital twin applications in power electronics.</description></item><item><title>Dissipation-Based Dynamics-Aware Learning Scheme for Transient Stability Analysis of Networked Black-Box Grid-Forming Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11175507</link><description>Dissipation-based stability analysis, leveraging Lyapunov functions, is popular for assessing the transient stability of inverter-based power systems. However, the proprietary nature of vendor-specific inverter control schemes often results in &#8220;black-box&#8221; inverter models with limited transparency, while there remains a need for a &#8220;generalized&#8221; transient stability assessment framework, as opposed to the case-specific designs typically employed in current practice. To address these limitations, this letter proposes a dissipation-based dynamics-aware learning scheme for transient stability analysis of power grids with networked black-box grid-forming inverters. Unlike classical black-box modeling approaches that learn pointwise trajectory mappings as output characteristics, the proposed method directly learns state variable derivatives to uncover the underlying dynamics that govern system evolution. Leveraging the universal approximation capability of neural networks (NNs), the unknown system dynamics are first captured by a NN. Subsequently, data sampled from this NN facilitates the training of a separate NN that represents the Lyapunov function. The proposed bilevel approach enables generalized transient stability evaluation for highly nonlinear system without requiring explicit system models, making it applicable to diverse practical scenarios. Case studies are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Repairable, Recyclable, and Reliable Power Electronics Using Liquid Metal Interconnection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11175024</link><description>The progression of power electronics technologies prioritizes efficiency and power density, often paying scant attention to the converter&#8217;s own lifecycle environmental impact, resulting in significant and unnecessary waste. Traditional packaging and assembling methods of power electronic devices and converters rely on rigid bonding, such as soldering and sintering, to interconnect parts, causing challenges of disassembling and separating parts when repairing and recycling are needed. This letter introduces liquid metal (LM) as a bonding mechanism in power electronic device packaging and converter assembling. The fluidic interconnection using LM is invented to enable parts separation and thermomechanical stress reduction without compromising electrical performance. Therefore, repairable, recyclable, and reliable power electronics is achieved. Straightforward assembling and disassembling processes are demonstrated by a real repair case of the LM-based power stage. Electrical performance is validated by a buck converter, achieving an efficiency of up to 98.2%.</description></item><item><title>Multiparameter Identification Algorithm With Constant-Voltage Control for Fractional-Order Wireless Power Transfer Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11204690</link><description>Fractional-order wireless power transfer (FOWPT) systems improve robustness by utilizing fractional-order components, addressing the performance degradation of traditional integer-order systems caused by parameter variations. However, they are still limited by the load range, coupling distance, and resonant frequency offset. Moreover, existing research seldom considers the influence of multiparameter changes such as coil self-inductance, mutual inductance, and load on the output characteristics in practical applications. Therefore, this letter proposes a parameter identification method for FOWPT system based on differential evolution algorithm, which realizes the simultaneous identification of multiple parameters including load, self-inductance, and mutual inductance. Based on the parameter identification results, a constant-voltage output control strategy is further presented. Experimental results show that the system stably outputs 12 V with an error of only 0.083%, verifying the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method and providing new insights for the optimization and application of FOWPT systems.</description></item><item><title>Turn-on Switching Loss Reduction for 10 kV SiC mosfets Without Increasing dv/dt Using Desat Protection Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11206520</link><description>Enabled by the fast switching capability of emerging 10 kV SiC mosfets, medium voltage (MV) power converters can achieve significantly reduced power loss. However, high dv/dt of 10 kV SiC mosfets also poses challenges for MV converter design. This letter proposes a simple method to reduce turn-on switching loss of 10 kV SiC mosfet without increasing dv/dt. The proposed circuit employs a widely used desat short-circuit protection circuit to determine the dv/dt stage of the turn-on switching transient and adjust the gate resistance to accelerate current rise period, while maintaining voltage fall period unchanged. The proposed circuit can achieve switching loss reduction under various dc voltages and load currents similar to a closed-loop active gate driver, but the circuit required is quite simple.

During testing, the measurement circuit must accurately detect the brief low-voltage portion of VDS while withstanding its full high-voltage swing, which presents significant challenges for circuit design. This letter introduces a novel approach for measuring turn-off delay times by detecting the current across the gate-loop resistor caused by the displacement current in the counterpart switch. In this case, the detection circuit can be entirely implemented using gate drive signals without detecting VDS and fully integrated into the gate driver, enhancing the flexibility of applications utilizing turn-off delay time for online junction temperature monitoring. Subsequently, a nonisolated circuit design (requiring fewer components) is presented, calibrated with a double-pulse test, and further validated through continuous operation in a buck converter.</description></item><item><title>An Antimisalignment Electric Vehicle Wireless Charging System Based on Two Transmitting Coils With LCC-S Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11218841</link><description>In an electric vehicle (EV) wireless power transfer system, a critical challenge is to address mutual inductance variations and output fluctuations caused by the misalignment along the lateral direction of the EV. This letter proposes an antimisalignment method using two transmitting coils. First, an inductor&#8211;capacitor&#8211;capacitor series topology is adopted on the transmitting side. The relationship between the output voltage and the mutual inductance is derived, and a compensation parameter design method is proposed. Second, an output voltage compensation method is proposed to enhance the misalignment tolerance performance. Finally, an experimental prototype is built to verify the validity of the theory. The experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve an output performance of 200 V and 1 kW, with a peak efficiency of 95.17% over the misalignment range.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Frequency Ultra-Wide-Load Resonant Inverter for Electrosurgical Generator System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224601</link><description>This letter presents a dual-frequency electrosurgical generator (ESG) based on a Class EF inverter, designed to accommodate ultra-wide impedance variations encountered during surgical procedures. The inherent load-insensitive characteristics of the Class EF inverter at a single frequency are further enhanced through the adoption of a dual-frequency operation strategy. To explore the design potential, inequality constraints and an impedance-based analysis method are employed. High operational efficiency is established as the primary design goal, and a simple dual-frequency and current control scheme is implemented to maintain stable output power. In the experimental validation, a 3/4-MHz ESG system is developed, achieving an efficiency above 63% and delivering 20 W of output power across a wide load range of 50&#8211;1500 $\Omega$.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Capacitance Extraction Method for Multichip Power Modules for EMI Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151216</link><description>Extracting parasitic capacitances in multichip power modules (MCPMs) is essential for reliable electromagnetic interference (EMI) analysis, especially in switching systems such as automotive inverters or converters. Such applications increasingly employ multibridge MCPMs&#8212;where multiple half-bridge cells are integrated and each bridge drives a different motor or load&#8212; making the characterization of capacitance more critical. Conventional approaches, such as curve tracers and transient fitting techniques, suffer from limitations including single-frequency measurement, a complex measurement setup, and the need for repeated tests under different bias conditions. These drawbacks limit their practicality for complex module-level characterization. This article proposes a generalized capacitance extraction method based on two-port S-parameter measurements. The proposed method enables modeling of both static and dynamic capacitances under various voltage biases, with minimal reconfiguration of terminal connections. Experimental validation using a commercial IGBT-based MCPM demonstrated that the proposed method significantly reduces setup complexity compared to conventional measurements. These results confirm that the method is effective for EMI analysis and modeling of advanced MCPMs.</description></item><item><title>GaN-Based Inductive Charging DOS Pulse Generator Using IGBT-Isolated Modules With Bipolar Output and Adjustable Stacking for DBD Plasma Jet</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11157733</link><description>High-frequency, fast-rising nanosecond pulses have attracted considerable interest in various fields, particularly for driving dielectric barrier discharge plasma jets. The rapid reverse cutoff of diodes enables the diode opening switch (DOS) to generate ultrashort nanosecond pulses. However, it relies on small resistors and a high-power dc source for high-frequency operation, leading to low charging voltage gain and significant charging losses. Additionally, the limited controllability of diodes makes it difficult to adjust output polarity. Herein, a new DOS utilizing GaN with LC charging (L-DOS) is proposed. An inductor stores energy that is dissipated in the charging resistor of traditional DOS, achieving a higher charging voltage gain. Additionally, a new modular L-DOS circuit with IGBT isolation is designed. IGBT provides a controlled current path for the fast-rising pulses generated by the diodes, allowing for bipolar output with adjustable stacking. Results show that L-DOS achieves a fivefold increase in charging voltage gain with only 25% of the charging loss of traditional DOS, thereby enabling the generation of 5.8-kV pulses with a duration of 6.8 ns under a low input voltage of 100 V. The 4-stage prototype can not only output bipolar pulses but also achieve amplitude stacking up to 10.6 kV and bipolar frequency stacking up to 2 MHz.</description></item><item><title>Achieving ZVS in Asymmetrical Half-Bridge Structures: A Thorough Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11164343</link><description>As the demand for more efficient and compact power converters grows, the trend points to a progressive raise of their switching frequency. However, even with wide-bandgap semiconductors, switching losses limit the maximum frequency at which they can operate, requiring zero-voltage switching (ZVS) to maximize efficiency and to prevent overheating. Existing studies state that the conditions to achieve ZVS depend only on the stored charge in the output parasitic capacitances of the transistors, but this statement is not applicable for the asymmetrical half-bridge (AHB) structure defined in this article, commonly found in topologies such as the buck and the asymmetrical half-bridge flyback. This article addresses this limitation by deriving a novel condition for achieving complete ZVS in the AHB, showing that both, the stored charge and the stored energy in the transistors must be considered. It also proposes a simplified circuit for analyzing dead times and discusses the issue of having different switches in a half-bridge, stating the advantage of placing high capacitance transistors in the low-side. Furthermore, this article proposes some consideration for dimensioning the converter that facilitate achieving ZVS. Experimental measurements validate the theoretical analysis, demonstrating its potential in the design of high efficiency and high power density converters.</description></item><item><title>Safe-Operation-Area Extended IGBT Module With Enhanced Near-Junction Thermal Capacitance and Advanced Cooling for Transient High-Current Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11184245</link><description>With the growing integration of renewable energy sources, grid-connected converters are expected to provide overcurrent (OC) capability similar to those of synchronous generators. To address this challenge, we propose a power module that incorporates both enhanced near-junction thermal capacitance (NJTC) and exceptional cooling capacity. The module utilizes copper blocks as top-side interconnects, substantially enhancing NJTC and enabling dual thermal paths. Concurrently, it integrates a substrate-embedded manifold microchannel (MMC) heatsink to achieve ultralow thermal resistance. Using the simulation-optimized structural parameters of the NJTC and MMC heat sink, a 1200 V/100 A IGBT half-bridge power module with reliable connections is fabricated through silver sintering technology. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed module achieves a 50% higher steady-state current-carrying capacity than the pin-fin module at identical junction temperatures. Under OC conditions, the module operates stably for 3.33 s at 3 p.u. (per unit) with 1000 W heat dissipation per IGBT. At 2.5 p.u., it sustains safe operation over extended periods, outperforming the pin-fin module by a factor of ten. The heat extraction of different mechanisms during OC conditions is quantitatively analyzed through simulation. Double-pulse test results indicate that the proposed module exhibits a parasitic inductance of 25.91 nH, including the parasitics of the test circuit, which is slightly lower than that of typical wire-bonded modules. The demonstrated safe-operation-area extension makes this packaging approach highly promising for future high-reliability, high-performance grid-connected converter systems.</description></item><item><title>Partial Power Converter Based on the Gate Voltage Self-Balancing Supercascode Power Switch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11184860</link><description>To simplify the topology and control under medium-voltage dc input, a novel partial power dc transformer (DCX) based on gate voltage self-balancing supercascode power switches (GVSB-SCPSs) is proposed. The front stage of DCX is constructed by GVSB-SCPSs, which realize the medium-voltage dc input of a single module and a fixed voltage ratio. The closed-loop stabilized voltage output is achieved through the proposed partial power processing circuit, which handles a small portion of the output power. In the proposed converter, the high-frequency operation process of GVSB-SCPSs and the unique gate switching pattern during the dead time are analyzed. Based on this, the boundary condition of soft switching in the proposed converter is derived. Under this condition, the loss of the proposed converter is analyzed, and the dead time is optimally designed. Based on the proposed topology, a partial power converter experimental prototype is built. The prototype is constructed through the designed GVSB-SCPSs, which have been tested at 10 kV and demonstrate outstanding switching characteristics. The experimental results of the partial power converter prototype show that all the GVSB-SCPSs realize a ZVS soft switch at 4 kV, 20 kHz. Furthermore, the closed-loop stabilized voltage output is achieved, verifying the feasibility of the proposed PPP and DCX circuit.</description></item><item><title>Stability-Enhanced Low-Dropout Regulator With High PSRR in 40-nm CMOS for System-on-Chip Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11190462</link><description>Power supply noise can significantly degrade the performance of complex systems by reducing the signal-to-noise ratio. To address this, a low-dropout regulator (LDO) with both high power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) and robust stability under large load currents is essential. Conventional LDOs often face a trade-off between achieving high PSRR and maintaining stability, especially at large load currents and wide bandwidths. This article presents a simple yet effective LDO design approach that achieves excellent PSRR without compromising stability, even under large load current conditions. Two novel compensation techniques, adaptive zero compensation and dc-coupled zero compensation, are introduced to enhance stability margins. Stability is rigorously evaluated under process and temperature variations, as well as varying equivalent series resistance (RESR), load equivalent series inductance (LESL), and output capacitance. The proposed design demonstrates a phase margin exceeding 45 degrees and a gain margin greater than 10 dB in worst-case scenarios. Fabricated in 40-nm bulk CMOS technology, the LDO achieves PSRR greater than 60 dB up to 5 MHz and supports load currents up to 250 mA. It also delivers excellent line and load regulation, making it well suited for noise-sensitive system-on-chip applications that demand both high dynamic performance and enhanced stability.</description></item><item><title>Utilizing Silicone Gel Encapsulation in Power Semiconductor Module to Improve Manufacturability While Reducing Common-Mode Noise</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192658</link><description>The novel power module introduced in this article features an etched section of the bottom copper layer of a direct-bonded copper substrate, encapsulated in silicone gel.

The measured CM noise in prototype hardware was decreased by maximum 5 dB&#956;V in steady-state operation. Thermal cycling tests with a total of 1000 cycles confirmed the proposed power module does not compromise mechanical stability.</description></item><item><title>A &#8220;Hand-in-Hand&#8221; Dynamic Current-Sharing Layout for Hybrid Double-Sided Cooling GaN Module</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192784</link><description>Gallium nitride HEMTs provide exceptional advantages for high-power, space-constrained applications owing to their ultrahigh di/dt and dv/dt capabilities. However, these strengths render them prone to parasitics from layout, making current-sharing between multiple parallel chips difficult. This article develops a parasitic coupling network model for vertical commutation structures, quantitatively analyzing layout-dependent parameters (&#916;Ls, &#916;Ms, &#916;Mds, &#916;Mbs, &#916;Mpg, &#916;Mpks.) and their impact on current imbalance while offering optimized layout guidelines for power and gate-drive loops. A novel &#8220;hand-in-hand&#8221; parallel layout integrated with hybrid double-sided cooling is proposed, achieving parasitic consistency (&#916;Ls &#8804; 11.67%, &#916;Ms &#8804; 17.55%, &#916;Mds &#8804; 2.76%, &#916;Mbs &#8804; 1.96%, &#916;Mpg &#8804; 2.5%, and &#916;Mpks &#8804; 4.5%) and suppressing dynamic current deviation to &#916;Ion &#8804; 1.7 A and &#916;Ioff &#8804; 2.6 A. By adopting a unilateral gate-drive configuration, spacers are eliminated during heat dissipation substrate assembly, reducing thermal resistance by 50.5%. Experimental validation under 300 V, 48&#8211;208 A, and a case temperature range of 30&#8211;90 &#176;C confirms a current imbalance of less than 10%. Continuous operation at 300 V/50 A with forced-air cooling stabilizes module temperature at 33.6 &#176;C (deviation &lt; 1.8% from simulations), verifying thermal performance and sustained operational ability.</description></item><item><title>A Symmetrical Five-Switch Hybrid Boost Converter With Output Voltage Ripple Reduction and Right-Half-Plane Zero Elimination</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11193728</link><description>This article proposes a symmetrical five-switch hybrid (SFSH) boost converter, which has the same voltage conversion ratio as the conventional boost converter and eliminates the right-half-plane zero. By making the output current path always include an inductor current path and a capacitor current path, the continuity of the output current is enhanced and the ripple of output voltage is reduced. In addition, the SFSH converter solves the flying capacitor inrush current problem in extreme duty cycle, further reducing the conduction loss in capacitor path. An experimental prototype with switching frequency of 200 kHz is designed to verify the performance of the proposed converter. The measurement results demonstrate that the SFSH converter achieves a peak efficiency of 94.5% under the condition of $V_{IN}$ = 4 V, $V_{OUT}$ = 6 V, and $I_{Load}$ = 200 mA. Compared with conventional boost converter, the output voltage ripple is reduced by up to 40 mV. The recovery time is less than 120 &#956;s under the load transient between 100 and 500 mA.</description></item><item><title>Control Strategy Against Capacitance Degradation for BLDC Drives With Small DC-Link Capacitor in Series With IGBT</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165484</link><description>In brushless dc motor (BLDCM) drives with a small dc-link film capacitor and a series-connected IGBT, capacitor degradation can significantly compromise system performance and reliability. To address this challenge, this article proposes a control strategy specifically designed to mitigate capacitance degradation effects. The core of the strategy involves intentionally advancing the natural voltage separation point between the film capacitor and diode rectifier outputs, thus establishing an artificial voltage separation instant. This approach ensures that the capacitor voltage consistently remains above the peak ac voltage despite capacitor degradation, effectively compensating for reduced energy storage capability. Compared to the modulation strategy optimized for initial capacitor capacity, the proposed method only increases inverter switching actions during a limited portion of the control cycle in Zone I, without altering the switching frequency of the dc-link series IGBT. The proposed strategy does not require shutting down the system to replace the capacitor after degradation. Compared to the fault-tolerant topology of paralleling capacitors, the proposed strategy incurs no additional hardware cost. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Generalized INFORM Method for Low-Speed Position Sensorless Control of PMSM Using Single Current Sampling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11195770</link><description>In ac variable frequency drive systems, permanent magnet synchronous machines are highly favored for their remarkable efficiency, high power density, and compact mechanical structure. Position sensorless control of PMSMs offers notable advantages in enhancing reliability and reducing cost. At the same time, high-precision current sensors are expensive, and the use of single current sampling can further reduce costs. However, the reliability of position sensorless control, particularly at low speeds, is impacted by the distortion of applied voltage due to the phase shift of unmeasurable regions, which, in turn, leads to the failure of position observation. In order to solve the problem of combining single current sampling with position sensorless control, this article proposes the Generalized Indirect Flux detection by Online Reactance Measurement method, where the angles of injected voltage vectors can be arbitrarily assigned to minimize the negative impact of unmeasurable regions and enhance control reliability. Furthermore, the dynamic PWM modulation method is proposed, where the field-oriented control execution frequency is increased to further enhance the dynamic performance of the control system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experiments on a 2.2-kW platform.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Two-Dimensional SVPWM and Phase Difference Boundary Analysis for Transformerless Back-to-Back Cascaded H-Bridge Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11159157</link><description>Conventional space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM) schemes for back-to-back cascaded H-bridge converters suffer from problems such as limited available sectors and the risk of capacitor short-circuit faults under phase difference conditions. To address these issues, a two-dimensional (2-D) SVPWM strategy based on bilateral voltage balancing is proposed in this article. The strategy optimizes the vector synthesis paths, expanding the boundary range of available sectors by 20% . It also ensures smooth transitions in port voltage levels, effectively reducing switching losses and voltage stress. Furthermore, the constraints between the modulation index and phase difference are clarified, providing a theoretical foundation for parameter design and stable operation.

Recent studies have shown that certain grid transformer configurations allow the full control of dc-side pole power flows by multitasking the converter-side windings to carry the required dc balancing current through a dedicated neutral line (NL). NL-based NPC converter systems offer a simpler and more cost-effective alternative to VB-based systems, but suffer from significant NL current ripple caused by the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) switching of the converter. This article addresses the issue on two fronts. First, an in-depth analysis of the NL current ripple is conducted in a dual NPC converter system. Analytical expressions are derived to characterize the harmonic distribution under both phase disposition (PD) and alternate phase opposition disposition (APOD) PWM strategies. Second, based on the analysis, an improved PD-PWM strategy incorporating triple degrees-of-freedom (PD-TDoF) is proposed for dual NPC converters, effectively reducing current ripple and significantly enhancing NL current performance compared to conventional PD-PWM. The theoretical analysis and effectiveness of the proposed PD-TDoF strategy are validated through laboratory experiments.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical DC Current Balancing Strategy for Multilevel Current-Source Converters Based on Differential-Mode Sectional Power and Dual-Redundant Vector Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192597</link><description>Unbalanced dc inductor currents in multilevel current-source converters can degrade power quality and potentially lead to overloading of individual modules or bridge arms. Traditional current balancing strategies either require extensive processing of redundant vectors or exhibit limited degrees of freedom, which increases complexity or directly affects current balancing performance. This article proposes a novel hierarchical current balancing control strategy based on the analysis of differential-mode (DM) and common-mode (CM) components of dc currents. By adjusting the component aligning with the capacitor voltage in the module current reference, the ac DM-sectional power of the module is regulated, thereby balancing the dc DM components across modules. Furthermore, by adjusting the duration allocation ratio of two distinct zero vectors within the vector sequence of the module, the dc CM components are suppressed, ensuring balanced currents in the upper and lower branches. The proposed method is easily implementable, eliminating the need for complex redundant vector management and intricate multivariable sorting, while introducing minimal additional switching frequency. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Compensation-Based 3D-SVPWM Strategy Employing Positive and Negative DC-Link Voltages Sampling for Three-Phase Four-Wire Three-Level Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11164875</link><description>Three-phase four-wire three-level (3P4W-3L) converters demonstrate broad application prospects in off-grid systems, while facing complex and variable operating conditions. Under asymmetrical loads, their dc-link neutral-point potential (NPP) exhibits fundamental-frequency oscillation proportional to the load unbalance factor. The adoption of traditional three-dimensional space vector modulation (3D-SVPWM) based on the assumption of balanced positive and negative dc-link voltages leads to substantial output errors during large-amplitude NPP oscillation, ultimately causing three-phase voltage unbalance and elevated total harmonic distortion (THD). Further theoretical analysis confirms that such errors introduce third-harmonic components in the output voltages. A compensation-based 3D-SVPWM strategy employing positive and negative dc-link voltages sampling is proposed in this article, which constructs the 3D space vector diagram based on the real-time sampling values of positive and negative dc-link voltages. Using the real-time positions of basic vectors, subsectors in the vector diagram are optimally redivided and the vector dwell times are calculated accordingly. This strategy effectively suppresses third-harmonic components in the output voltages, ensuring that the system can still output high-quality voltage waveforms even when the NPP oscillates greatly. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified through comparative experiments, showing a high balance degree and low THD of the output voltages.</description></item><item><title>On Magnetic Shielding for Axial Winding Segmented Coreless Transformers in Self-Sustained Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168464</link><description>In this article, the magnetic field characteristics and shielding design for the axial winding segmented coreless transformer (CLT) in self-sustained converters are studied. The axial winding segmented design can reduce the volume of CLTs, and its magnetic field is constrained in a smaller space, effectively decreasing the dimensions and cost of the electromagnetic shielding enclosure. The shielding is equivalent to a passive RL circuit coupled with CLTs, and then the virtual magnetic permeability is introduced to derive the expressions for self- and mutual impedance, transformation ratio, power loss, operating frequency, and the current phase angle. The analysis results show that the self-sustained converter with CLTs can adapt to the parameter variations caused by the shielding insertion, i.e., the electrical, thermal, and structural parameter design of CLTs be separated from its shielding design. Meanwhile, in order to solve the contradiction among power density, magnetic shielding, and heat dissipation, a closed-form design method of conductive shielding with aperture array is proposed, which integrates the heat sink with the shielding to satisfy the magnetic shielding and improve the heat dissipation capability of the system. A 1.5 kW prototype is fabricated to verify the theoretical analysis.

Therefore, in this article, power cycling tests (PCTs) considering moisture intrusion is conducted for the 6.5 kV IGBT modules. Whether it is conventional PCT or PCT considering moisture intrusion, its failure mode is manifested as an increase in thermal resistance with solder layer degradation. In conventional PCT, the failure mechanism of the module is chip solder aging, while for modules with moisture intrusion, the chip solder only shows slight aging, indicating that there are other factors causing the increase in module thermal resistance. Through comparison with scanning acoustic microscope, it was found that modules with moisture intrusion had uneven thickness of the system solder layers after PCT. This is because the high temperature during the PCT process increases the expansion stress of moisture, causing deformation of the system solder layer, then accelerating its ageing process. Furthermore, by comparing the transient thermal impedance (Zth) before and after moisture intrusion, it was found that the curve separated around the system solder layers inside the module.</description></item><item><title>Improved ADRC With a Disturbance-Separation CESO Based on Complex Coefficient-Filter for Current Source Rectifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165752</link><description>Under complicated operations, the tracking performance and interference rejection ability of the LC-filtered current source rectifiers (CSRs) are inevitably compromised by various disturbances, including aperiodic and periodic disturbances.

In this system, the SRM windings can be selectively and stably energized with overlapped excitation region through the magnetic link. Initially, the wireless SRM with trap filters and elaborately designed primary compensation is utilized to avoid cross interference between channels and realize power equalization of targeted windings. Additionally, an asymmetric drive method is applied to the inverter to construct a multifrequency ac excitation source. This method contains triple states, namely two half-bridge drive states in single-phase excitation mode (SPEM) and a full-bridge drive state in dual-phase excitation mode (DPEM), which facilitates the bridge leg operating frequencies configured with greater flexibility compared to the conventional dual-state drive method. Moreover, an enhanced commutation control is embedded into the traditional hybrid excitation strategy. When inheriting the merits of the overlapped winding excitation, this novel control eliminates the shift of a nonzero operating frequency from one inverter bridge leg to another, thus eliminating the sudden drop of terminal voltage during operating modes switching, and improving the stability and torque output of the motor. Finally, experimental results verify the validity of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Degree-of-Freedom Bearingless Switched Reluctance Motor With Biased Permanent Magnets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11164532</link><description>A traditional bearingless switched reluctance motor (BSRM) can only achieve two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) radial levitation of its rotor shaft.

The crucial aspect is to combine the standard Hall-effect position sensor with wireless sensor coils. The sensor coils possess functions of detector excitation and wireless information transfer (WIT) regulated by secondary-side bidirectional switches. A novel combination of unipolar, horizontal bipolar, vertical bipolar, and quadrupole coils is employed to achieve four-channel decoupling, thus realizing coil integration. A new snubber, consisting of two resistor-capacitor-diode (RCD) snubbers connected in antiparallel, is proposed to suppress the significant bidirectional voltage spikes across bidirectional switches. This detector possesses strong robustness against motor power and commutation as its excitation is independent from the wireless power transfer (WPT) channel of wireless BLDC. Besides, it enables extremely low delay since no complex commutation protocols like those in Bluetooth are involved. Moreover, its binary output signals can be directly recognized by the primary-side controller, not requiring additional algorithms or circuits for decoding or filtering. This detector holds the highest experimental speed record at 10&#8201;000 rpm among all existing wireless position sensors for wireless motors, with a delay of only 0.9% of the minimum Bluetooth communication latency.</description></item><item><title>An Online Estimation Method for DC-Link Capacitor in Doubly Salient Electromagnetic Motor Drive System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11178083</link><description>As a key component of the motor drive system, the dc-link capacitor has a significant impact on the system reliability.

The power switches and a dc-bus capacitor are shared. The proposed LED driver can be divided into a two-stage: the power factor correction (PFC) stage uses the output characteristics of a zero-voltage and zero-derivative-switching (ZVDS) Class-E current-driven rectifier as a power-factor corrector; in addition, this PFC stage is designed for the continuous conduction mode (CCM) operation, and the driver stage uses a zero-voltage switching Class-D LLC converter to supply a constant dc-driven current to the LED load. The circuit operation and step-by-step design of the converter are fully described. The proposed scheme works better with the CCM-ZVDS Class-E current-driven rectifier because it reduces the high current stress on the power switch caused by high di/dt.

These cyber-attacks, once infiltrated, can either destabilize the complete system or remain undetected by maintaining operational control objectives despite the presence of an attack. This article presents a method for the local detection of such sophisticated covert attacks targeting DCMG actuators. A robust, converter-level detection metric is proposed that relies on both measured and internal states of each node. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed metric is explicitly designed to remain invariant to line and load variations, ensuring high sensitivity to attack vectors alone. In addition, a detection algorithm based on a finite state machine (FSM) framework is introduced to guarantee accurate and consistent identification of genuine attacks. The stealthiness of these covert attacks and the efficacy of the proposed detection method are validated through simulation and experimentation on a four-node DCMG laboratory prototype.</description></item><item><title>A Pseudobinary Cascaded H-Bridge Converter for the Front-End Stage of Solid-State Transformers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11176443</link><description>A converter based on the binary cascaded H-bridge (BCHB) regarded as the pseudobinary CHB (PBCHB) is proposed for the ac&#8211;dc front-end stage in solid-state transformers (SSTs). The hybrid modulator of the BCHB produces step-like sinusoidal waveforms with near-line-frequency commutations in the high-voltage cells and high-frequency commutations in the low-voltage cell. The power stage design of high-voltage cells transferring the active power can be modularized. However, the power transfer among them is unequal, and the issue has not been investigated. This article proposes a 15-level PBCHB that maintains a modular design while ensuring balanced power transfer and negligible switching losses among the high-voltage cells, regarded as active cells. The low-voltage high-frequency cell, which is regarded as the floating capacitor cell, is used as a power quality enhancer without real power consumption. Consequently, the original BCHB architecture is slightly modified along with the controller design to become PBCHB, balancing the power transfer among the active cells while maintaining equal voltage levels at their dc side. In this article, the design and analysis of the modulator and its controller for the PBCHB are presented in detail.

However, the dual-frequency power oscillation problem might seriously threaten its stable operation. Based on the P/&#969; admittance model of the multi-VSGs parallel supercharger, a new perspective of dual-frequency power oscillation in multi-VSGs parallel supercharger system is discovered. Specifically, with the various numbers of parallel VSGs, the power oscillation amplitude trend of the supercharger system under load power perturbation (LPP) and grid frequency perturbation (GFP) is opposite. Moreover, the larger the number of parallel VSGs, the greater the power oscillation caused by the GFP, which more easily leads to overload operation of the power transformer. Therefore, a dual-frequency power oscillation suppression method based on error power feedforward compensation (EPFC) is proposed, which can suppress the dual-frequency oscillation under two different perturbations regardless of the variation in the number of parallel VSGs. Finally, a three-VSG parallel supercharger platform is constructed to verify the accuracy of the new perspective and the effectiveness of the oscillation suppression method.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Asymmetrical-Parallelled LLC Resonant Converter for Light Load Efficiency Improvement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11176849</link><description>LLC resonant converters have been extensively applied in many applications due to their low switching loss and galvanic isolation features.

The generation and characteristics of high-frequency grid harmonics and interharmonics are correlated with pulse width modulation (PWM) of grid-integrated converters with amplitude&#8211;frequency (A&#8211;F) interfered modulation signals.

Conventional PS-MPC strategies utilize a steady-state control input reference, typically a harmonic-free signal depending on the converter topology. However, this article demonstrates that the PS-MPC strategy applied to the 3L-ANPCconverter requires a control input containing a third-harmonic component with a specific magnitude and phase angle, which improves output current tracking and capacitor voltage balancing. By designing synchronized models for each carrier, the predictive controller optimizes duty cycles independently, ensuring the effective regulation of both control variables while addressing model nonlinearities. The proposed strategy is experimentally validated using a DSP F28379D microcontroller and a three-phase 3L-ANPCconverter using a total of 64 switching states in a grid-connected application. Compared to PS-PWM and FCS-MPC, the proposed approach maintains a fixed switching frequency, improves steady-state tracking, and enhances capacitor voltage balancing with a fast dynamic response. Additionally, it outperforms PS-MPC with control input change penalization (PS-MPC ${\boldsymbol\Delta} \boldsymbol{u}$) by reducing spectral dispersion while achieving lower execution time than both FCS-MPC and PS-MPC ${\boldsymbol\Delta} \boldsymbol{u}$, making it more suitable for real-time implementation. Such results are also discussed with a video demonstrating the real-time implementation.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Control Strategy to Enhance the Transient Performance of Grid-Forming Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11177595</link><description>In response to the issues of transient power angle instability and fault current (FC) over-limit under severe grid three-phase symmetrical faults for grid-forming voltage source converters (GFM-VSCs), this article proposes a novel joint control method combining second-order sliding mode control (SOSMC) with voltage adaptive regulation. Initially, an improved integral sliding surface is introduced into the active power-frequency loop of the GFM-VSC, and a Lyapunov function is constructed, which pertains to a large-signal problem. Based on this stability criterion, an output power control law is designed to strictly limit the fluctuation of the power angle. Subsequently, a reactive power&#8211;voltage loop switching control is employed to provide stable reactive power and support grid voltage, while ensuring that the steady-state current (SSC) is maintained within a safe threshold. Additionally, during faults, a virtual impedance is engaged, and the transient current (TC) can be suppressed by adjusting the ratio of resistance-to-inductance (R/L) and recovery resistance. This method achieves power angle stability (PAS) and fault current suppression (FCS) simultaneously, even during grid voltage sags accompanied by phase changes. Finally, the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method are validated on the real-time test platform.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Dual Input Quasi Z Source Bidirectional DC&#8211;DC Converter for Battery Powered Inverter Fed Microgrid Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168956</link><description>This article presents a novel dual-input bidirectional quasi-Z-source dc&#8211;dc converter (DIBQZSC) using minimum components designed for 1&#8239;kW, 400&#8239;V, 50 kHz applications in microgrid.

Typically, a cascaded proportional-integral (PI) control scheme is employed for the regulation of the MMC&#8217;s dc-bus voltage, which is based on a second-order system model. However, achieving an optimal balance between dynamic performance and disturbance rejection using such schemes poses significant challenges. Moreover, MMCs often exhibit substantial energy nonlinearity, especially at the high-voltage dc-bus, which further complicates their operation and control. To address these issues, this article introduces a full-state feedback control (FSFC) strategy specifically designed for MMCs. The proposed method involves constructing an energy-based model to linearize the dc voltage control process. By incorporating full-state variable feedback, the FSFC reduces equivalent system model order, thereby enhancing disturbance suppression and accelerating response times. The article also presents the block diagram of the FSFC, determining the state feedback gain that yields optimal damping characteristics. Comparative analysis of the cascaded PI control and the proposed FSFC is performed under identical crossover frequencies and phase margins. Simulation and experimental results confirm that the FSFC offers superior advantages in terms of dynamic response and stability compared with existing advanced control schemes.</description></item><item><title>A Constant Frequency ZVS Modulation Scheme for Four-Switch Buck-Boost Converter With Optimal ZVS Conditions Based on BP Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11172735</link><description>The pseudocontinuous conduction mode (PCCM) four-switch buck-boost (FSBB) converter is widely used in applications with wide input and output voltage ranges. In this article, a constant frequency zero-voltage switching (ZVS) modulation scheme with minimized root mean square (rms) inductor current is proposed. The proposed constant frequency ZVS modulation scheme does not rely on data-heavy three-dimensional (3-D)/two-dimensional (2-D) look-up tables (LUTs) or require wide switching frequency variation. In addition, the accurate ZVS conditions of switches are derived through theoretical analysis, and approximated by using a back-propagation (BP) neural network, which allows simple and accurate calculation of ZVS conditions over wide operating ranges and facilitates the minimization of rms inductor current. Finally, a 300 W FSBB prototype is built to verify the proposed modulation scheme and the derived ZVS conditions.</description></item><item><title>Robust Power Decoupling Controller Design for Grid-Forming Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11169324</link><description>Unlike grid-following inverters (GFLIs) that serve as current sources, grid-forming inverters (GFMIs) act as voltage sources, capable of providing voltage support and inertia support to the power grid. By controlling the magnitude and angle of voltage, it is possible to achieve active ($\boldsymbol{P}$) and reactive ($\boldsymbol{Q}$) power transmission along the line. However, conventional algorithm such as virtual synchronous generator (VSG) exhibits coupling between$ \boldsymbol{P}$ and $\boldsymbol{Q}$ loops. To address this issue, this article first establishes dynamic models for active and reactive power, which indicate that coupling becomes severe when the grid impedance or the power angle increases. Subsequently, a hybrid control method based on active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) and H&#8734; control is proposed to decouple the $\boldsymbol{P}$ and $\boldsymbol{Q}$ loops in GFMIs. This strategy employs a data-driven H&#8734; controller as the inner loop for preliminary decoupling of the system, and uses ADRC control as the outer loop, with an extended state observer (ESO) to treat the undecoupled part as a disturbance for secondary decoupling of the system. As a result, the robustness of system decoupling is significantly enhanced. The decoupling performance of this controller has been verified through experiments, which demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of this method.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid-Modulated Moving-Discretized-Control-Set Model-Free Predictive Control for DAB Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11178065</link><description>When applying conventional moving-discretized-control-set model predictive control (MDCS-MPC), the voltage performance of dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter is affected by the number of the MDCS and the parameter errors. The former affects the dynamic performance of the MDCS-MPC, while the latter affects the robustness of the MDCS-MPC. To enhance the dynamic performance and robustness of conventional MDCS-MPC, this article proposes a hybrid-modulated moving-discretized-control-set model-free predictive control (HM-MDCS-MFPC) for DAB converters, where the proposed HM-MDCS-MFPC not only establishes and updates the data model of DAB for replacing the conventional mathematical model, but also designs a hybrid-modulated control set for boosting the regulation range of control set. The proposed HM-MDCS-MFPC effectively eliminates parametric effects under parametric fluctuation and enhances dynamic performance under various operating conditions. The simulations and experiments of DAB converter are conducted to validate the feasibility and performance of the proposed HM-MDCS-MFPC.</description></item><item><title>Observer-Based Passivity Control for DC/DC Power Converters With Constant Power Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11169322</link><description>DC microgrid is a new trend of future microgrid, which is expected to be more efficient than ac microgrid and more convenient to connect dc loads. Among various types of loads, the constant power load (CPL), which has negative impedance characteristic, can easily cause oscillations in dc microgrid, and may lead to grid collapse. This article proposes an observer-based passivity control scheme to solve the instability problem brought by CPL. A passivity-based controller (PBC) is designed to attenuate the oscillations caused by CPL by adopting the concept of energy dissipation. To improve the control performance, a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) is designed to estimate the value of CPL and compensate PBC in real-time. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed control scheme are verified through both simulations and experiments. The results show that, compared with existing methods, the proposed control scheme obtains better control performance and reduces computation burden.</description></item><item><title>Interpretable Wind Power Forecasting With Feature and Loss Function Construction Guided by Domain Knowledge</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11122909</link><description>Current wind power forecasting (WPF) methods predominantly rely on data-driven deep learning models, inherently lacking integration of domain knowledge, which limits forecasting accuracy and model interpretability. To address this issue, an interpretable data-knowledge fusion ultra-short-term WPF model is proposed, in which domain knowledge guides the feature construction process and is directly embedded into the design of the loss function. In the feature construction module, a wind speed-power curve is established to generate theoretical power outputs by using historical wind speed as inputs. These theoretical outputs, combined with historical measured data, serve as inputs for the model. In the loss function construction module, a boundary constraint loss is designed by extracting the upper and lower boundaries of wind power output using the alpha shape algorithm and Local Weighted Linear Regression based on wind speed and power data. Notably, the parameters of boundaries are dynamically updated to capture the volatility of wind power. Additionally, an error distribution shape loss is introduced to penalize the deviation of the training error distribution from the normal distribution, using Jensen-Shannon divergence as an indicator. Case studies across 30 wind farms demonstrate that the proposed method guided by interpretable knowledge achieves the best average performance across all time horizons compared to baseline models. The method also shows strong robustness in noise and missing data experiments.</description></item><item><title>Novel Unified Control Framework for Networked RES-BES Microgrids With Enhanced Performance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11120450</link><description>The increasing deployment of renewable energy sources (RESs) facilitates the interconnection of distributed energy networks, thereby maximizing the utilization of the unevenly distributed RESs. Networked hybrid ac/dc microgrids enable regional multi-terminal networks at end-user sites, offering plug-and-play integration for RESs and battery energy storage systems (BESs) through synergistic ac/dc complementarity. However, this interconnected configuration introduces increased complexity in control strategies and poses significant power management challenges for RES-BES microgrids, as sudden RES fluctuations demand system-wide BES compensation to prevent local overloads. This paper proposes a unified droop control-based framework for networked hybrid microgrids comprising RESs, BESs and loads. The proposed approach enables seamless transitions between operational modes, proportional power sharing, and enhanced operation without circulating currents or overstressing components. Furthermore, it inherently addresses abrupt source failures and asymmetric line faults without requiring adjustments in the primary control methods, ensuring uninterrupted maximum power harvest of RESs. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through case studies using real-time simulation platform Typhoon-HIL.</description></item><item><title>Time-Varying Inertia Characterization of DFIG-Based Wind Turbines for Power System Frequency Dynamic Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11113495</link><description>Accurately assessing the inertial response of renewable energy generation (REG) is critical for frequency stability. However, REG represented by doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine (WT) exhibits inherent time-varying inertia behavior, fundamentally distinct from synchronous generators (SGs). Prevailing inertia assessment methods predominantly rely on SG-derived time-domain inertia constants, which cannot capture this intrinsic variability. Consequently, the rationality of directly applying these conventional methods to DFIG-based WT lacks theoretical justification. To address this gap, this paper derives an expression for calculating time-varying inertia using the angular momentum theorem. Results demonstrate that inertia in the time domain dynamically varies with disturbances, highlighting the significant limitations of conventional inertia descriptions. Alternatively, a frequency-domain inertia characterization method is investigated to provide a disturbance-independent description of inertia, effectively capturing its intrinsic time-varying nature. Due to the duality between time and frequency domains, this paper mathematically describes the relationship between frequency-domain inertia and time-domain inertia, explicitly clarifying the physical meaning of inertia in the frequency domain. Simulations on an IEEE 39-bus system verify that the frequency-domain inertia method accurately captures inertia dynamics and is suitable for frequency stability analysis. These findings emphasize frequency-domain inertia characterization as an essential method for representing inertia in renewable-rich power systems.</description></item><item><title>Wind Turbulence-Induced Power Fluctuations Mitigation in PMSG-Based Wind Turbines by a Coordinated Control Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106269</link><description>Power fluctuations in large-scale wind turbines (WTs), induced by persistent wind turbulences, can degrade the reliability of power modules and increase mechanical stress on light-strength structural components. These issues entail intricate challenges for system operators in terms of operation and maintenance. This paper investigates specifications of power fluctuations in PMSG-based WTs and presents a control scheme advantageous both below and above the rated wind speed, without requiring additional energy storage devices. This work strives to bridge the gap between the complicated art of WT modeling and wind turbulence-induced power fluctuations aiming to reveal the origin of power fluctuations in terms of operating regions and control strategies. In the proposed control scheme, the power fluctuations are mitigated without any auxiliary control terms below the nominal wind speed. Above the nominal wind speed, the power smoothing action is performed via three items, in which the machine side converter (MSC) virtually regulates the rotor inertia, the grid side converter (GSC) exerts the damping component, and the pitch control system helps enhance the damping mechanism. The feedback gains of the auxiliary terms are optimized while considering their interactions. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed control scheme effectively mitigates both the electrical and mechanical oscillations.</description></item><item><title>Incorporating Frequency Security Constraints in Two-Stage Robust Unit Commitment of Integrated Transmission and Distribution System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11098731</link><description>With the integration of high-proportion renewable energies, the independent operation of the transmission and distribution systems (T&amp;amp;DSs) makes it difficult to achieve optimal scheduling and ensure frequency security. Therefore, this paper proposes a two-stage robust frequency-constrained unit commitment (TRO-FCUC) model of T&amp;amp;DS. Firstly, the impacts of distributed energy resources (DERs) frequency regulation capabilities on inertial response and primary frequency response (PFR) are considered, and dynamic frequency constraints considering the cooperation of thermal units, wind farms, and DERs with their inertia-based frequency reserve are constructed. Then, the TRO-FCUC model is formulated to address uncertainties of wind farms (WFs) and distributed photovoltaics (DPVs) based on uncertainty sets. Further, the column and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) algorithm and strong duality theory are utilized to transform the TRO-FCUC model into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) model and then solve it iteratively. Finally, case analyses proposed demonstrate that the coordinated operation of T&amp;amp;DS can fully mobilize the frequency regulation potential of DERs and improve the operation&#8217;s economy while ensuring the frequency security of the system.</description></item><item><title>Novel Series-Isolated-Parallel Wind Farm DC Collection System With New Control Strategies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11105057</link><description>Offshore wind farm (WF) DC collection systems offer significant reductions in weight and size compared to conventional AC systems. Among DC architectures, the series-parallel wind farm (SP-WF) configuration achieves higher efficiency by reducing the number of power conversion stages. However, because SP-WF places the DC-DC converter upstream of the series connection of wind turbines (WTs), it suffers from reduced reliability due to its vulnerability to DC short-circuit faults within the series string. This paper proposes a novel series-isolated-parallel wind farm (SIP-WF) architecture that enhances reliability by integrating a DC-DC converter to isolate each group of series-connected WTs. This isolation provides intrinsic DC fault blocking capability without the need for external DC circuit breakers. Furthermore, as only passive rectifiers are used at each individual WT, the proposed SIP-WF architecture maintains high efficiency. To manage maximum power point tracking (MPPT) across turbines experiencing different wind conditions, two new centralized control strategies are proposed to coordinate multiple WTs using a single DC-DC converter per group. The proposed SIP-WF architecture and control strategies are validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. A comprehensive performance comparison is conducted against existing DC collection topologies. The results demonstrate that SIP-WF achieves a higher net energy yield while reducing cost, system weight, and volume, and offering superior fault tolerance compared to conventional architectures.</description></item><item><title>Fault Ride-Through Strategy for Grid-Forming Converters Satisfying Multi-Objective Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11091548</link><description>Transient synchronization stability (TSS), current limitation and reactive power support (RPS) are the key objectives for fault ride-through (FRT) that grid-forming converters (GFMCs) must satisfy. However, the complex coupling restraints among these objectives, along with the fact that GFMC cannot directly control current due to its voltage-source nature, present significant challenges for FRT. To address these issues, this paper first analyzes the coupling relationships among the three objectives, and reveals the formations and control mechanisms of phase current, reactive current, and fault inrush current in GFMC. Inspired these insights, an adaptive FRT strategy is designed by cooperatively adjusting the active power and voltage references, as well as the adaptive virtual resistance, which satisfies FRT multi-objective constraints even if the voltage sags to 0. And it is straightforward to implement. Furthermore, the proposed FRT strategy is shown to exhibit superior TSS and RPS performance, as demonstrated through region of attraction and voltage phase portraits. Finally, simulation and experiment results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed FRT strategy.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability Analysis of MMC-HVDC Connected DFIG-Based Wind Farms in the Electromechanical Timescale</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106276</link><description>This paper investigates the transient stability of doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farms connected via a modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission system in the electromechanical timescale. During faults, the MMC tends to be switched to the current-limiting mode, which further interacts with the control systems of DFIG-based wind farms, thereby complicating the transient stability problem. In this paper, a large-signal model is constructed for transient stability analysis under this condition. The transient stability mechanism is revealed, and a transient stability index that considers the impact of a phase-locked loop in the electromechanical timescale is derived. The proposed index quantitatively assesses the instability risk arising from the coupled interaction between the DFIG-based wind farms and the MMC. In addition, the impacts of the current- limiting mode and other parameters (i.e., speed control loop gains, rotor shaft damping, inertia coefficient and fault location and severity) are analyzed. Based on the results of the parametric analysis, a suite of targeted countermeasures is proposed to enhance the transient stability of the power system. Finally, a theoretical analysis is demonstrated and verified through hardware-in-the-loop simulations using the Modeling Tech microgrid real-time simulation platform.</description></item><item><title>A Quantitative Accommodation Guaranteed Robust Scheduling Method for Renewable Power System With Dynamic Uncertainty Set</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11090046</link><description>Wind power generation (WPG) has been increasingly integrated into power systems to reduce carbon emissions. However, its inherent volatility and stochasticity have significantly challenged the reliable system operation and effective accommodation. In this paper, a robust scheduling method with a quantitative accommodation guarantee for power systems with WPG integration is proposed. First, a dynamic uncertainty set (DUS) of WPG is introduced, and a stochastic accommodation rate (SAR) indicator is accordingly proposed and derived to quantify the attainable accommodation level. Based on the DUS, a robust scheduling method is proposed, in which the implicit affine strategy (IAS) is adapted to guarantee the nonanticipativity of scheduling strategies. Moreover, a SAR constraint is carefully built according to the assessment result of the power system&#8217;s maximal and minimal SAR and embedded into the scheduling model to provide a quantitative accommodation guarantee. An illustrative case is presented to validate the effectiveness of the SAR indicator. Numerical simulations in the modified 6-bus, 14-bus, and 118-bus power systems validate the superiority of the proposed scheduling method.</description></item><item><title>Current Control and DC Capacitor Dynamic Interaction in a Cross-Timescale Manner in DFIG-WT Dominated Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11088231</link><description>The Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) based wind turbine (WT) contains control loops and energy storage components operating across multiple timescales, leading to potential cross-timescale influence dynamics in DFIG-WT-dominated power systems. Previous analyses have primarily focused on single timescale dynamics or the interactions between control loops at different timescales, with limited attention given to the cross-timescale influences between control loops and energy storage components. This paper aims to reveal the cross-timescale influence mechanism of current control at the AC-current-control timescale on the dynamics of the DC capacitor at the DC-voltage-control timescale. Modal analysis is a mature method used to uncover the cross-timescale influence phenomena and laws of current control on the dynamics of the DC capacitor. Subsequently, an equivalent circuit model is established to analyze the mechanism by which current control affects the dynamics of the DC capacitor. Finally, the conclusions are validated through simulations based on a four-machine two-area power system and the power grid of Northwest China.</description></item><item><title>Rapid Active Power Regulation of Distributed Photovoltaics Based on Optimal Dynamic Droop Coefficients</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11095309</link><description>To realize the active response for rapid active power regulation of massive distributed photovoltaics (DPVs), a bi-level architecture integrating clustering and optimization is proposed for the coordinated design of dynamic droop coefficients of DPVs in this paper. At the lower level, the adjustable capacity and response time are selected as clustering features according to the rapid active power regulation requirements, and the U-k-means algorithm is applied to implement the clustering of DPVs. At the upper level, a frequency deviation-optimal droop coefficient model incorporating the regulation performance and network losses is developed in a perspective that considers power flow impacts. The droop coefficient regulation strategy under various frequency fluctuations is pre-calculated by a graph attention network (GAT). Simulations are performed on a modified IEEE 33-bus test system, and the results verify the outperformance of the proposed GAT model over the existing neural network models, as well as the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed optimal droop coefficient regulation strategy.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Energy Management of Hybrid Energy Storage System With Application to Wave Energy Converters: A Learning-Augmented MPC Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11090041</link><description>Integrating hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) into wave energy converters (WECs) can mitigate power fluctuations of WECs across multiple timescales, provided that an effective energy management strategy (EMS) is implemented. Model predictive control (MPC) is the mainstream EMS for HESSs, as it typically yields a control solution close to the global optimum while satisfying constraints. However, MPC faces a high computational burden when the optimal control problem is nonlinear. More importantly, considering multiple competing objectives, tuning weighting factors (WFs) in the MPC cost function is also challenging. To tackle these challenges, this article proposes a learning-augmented MPC strategy to optimize energy management for the HESS in WECs. The strategy first utilizes a fuzzy logic-based asymmetric action trimming technique to reduce MPC computational time. Further, a warm-start Q-learning (QL) framework with high learning efficiency is applied to obtain the WF online tuning method. To bridge the simulation-to-reality gap in the QL framework, the article designs a neural network-based current predictor, aiming to sense the nonlinear power loss during power conversion. Finally, simulations and experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed strategy in reducing energy loss, battery degradation, and MPC computational burden.</description></item><item><title>Spatio-Temporal Probabilistic Forecasting of Wind Speed Using Transformer-Based Diffusion Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11091547</link><description>Spatio-temporal wind speed forecasting plays a crucial role in enhancing energy conversion efficiency and optimizing resource allocation, forming a cornerstone of sustainable development. However, existing methods for spatio-temporal wind speed forecasting face challenges in capturing intricate spatio-temporal dependencies and adapting to dynamic variations in wind speed data. To address these limitations, we propose the Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Transformer (PSTDT), a novel model that combines the generative power of denoising diffusion probabilistic models with the robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities of Transformers. This approach introduces a dual-spatial attention module to model static positional relationships and dynamic dependencies from historical data, thereby capturing evolving spatial correlations. Additionally, PSTDT integrates a dual-phase temporal module for modeling cross-period temporal dependencies alongside auto-regressive temporal features, enhancing its capacity to address the complexities of time-series forecasting. Furthermore, a temporal-adaptive layer normalization is incorporated to dynamically adjust normalization parameters, improving the model&#8217;s forecast accuracy and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PSTDT outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets, reducing continuous ranked probability score by 8% &#8211;20% and mean absolute error by 7% &#8211;19% .</description></item><item><title>End-to-End Collaborative Optimization for Active Distribution Network Power Dispatch Based on Sparse Model-Ensemble Learning Policy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119768</link><description>With the higher penetration of distributed renewable power sources, novel active distribution networks are increasingly implementing flexible adjustment strategies. Currently, the dual uncertainties from both sources and demand significantly affect power dispatch in distribution networks. Typically, power dispatch is performed using a predict-then-optimize approach, making it challenging to quantify the gap between the real-time and theoretically optimal dispatch performances due to inaccuracies in power predictions. Hence, this study introduces a novel end-to-end policy to solve a collaborative optimization between prediction and dispatch. The policy directly utilizes all available information, such as gridded numerical weather forecasts, for dispatch decision-making, which eliminates the need for power predictions as intermediate variables for dispatch. To address the challenges of high-dimensional and open-scenario model training in end-to-end policies, sparse model-ensemble learning is proposed to formulate the dispatch policy model. The model is solved using constrained policy optimization. Comparative studies show that the proposed end-to-end policy outperforms the predict-then-optimize policy in real-time dispatch cases involving photovoltaic reactive power ancillary service and demand response within distribution networks.</description></item><item><title>LPV Model Predictive Control for Offshore Wind Farms Considering Wake Delay Characteristics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082107</link><description>The pronounced wake effect in large-scale offshore wind farm necessitates careful consideration of its delay characteristics, which are crucial yet often overlooked in control. Addressing the coupling between the dynamic evolution of wake effects and the parameter changes of the WT control model, this paper introduces a Linear Parameter-Varying (LPV) model predictive control method that considers wake delay characteristics. Through the development of a quasi-steady state wake model, the wake delay characteristic is incorporated within an LPV model for the wind farm. A two-stage dimensionality reduction method is proposed to simplify the calculation, and a model predictive control (MPC) method is combined to optimize the fatigue damage balance and power generation enhancement in the wind farm coordinately. Simulation results from a wind farm consisting of 16 wind turbines validate the efficacy of the quasi-steady state wake model in depicting the spatial distribution of wake delays. Furthermore, in dynamically varying wind speed and directions scenarios, the proposed control method can effectively capture the wind speed delay and fluctuation characteristics between different wind turbines, leading to heightening power output and diminishing fatigue stresses. Notably, in comparison to the static model control, the adaptive parameter tuning mechanism inherent in the proposed method effectively curtails control overshoot, enhancing overall system performance.</description></item><item><title>Fast Frequency Response in Low Inertia Grids via Integrated Supercapacitor Energy Storage Systems and Wind Turbine Generators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082652</link><description>The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources in modern power systems has led to a significant reduction in system inertia, creating challenges for maintaining grid frequency stability. To address these issues, a new ancillary service market, termed &#8220;Fast Frequency Response (FFR)&#8221;, has emerged. FFR mandates rapid power delivery from renewable energy sources,including wind power systems, immediately following contingency events to alleviate frequency drops in a few seconds. This paper presents a control method combining supercapacitor energy storage systems and wind turbine generators to enhance the FFR capabilities of wind power systems and mitigate the frequency drop. This approach ensures the readiness of supercapacitor energy storage systems to provide FFR services under diverse wind conditions. Additionally, a control scheme for the wind turbine generator is developed to optimize its participation in FFR across a range of wind speeds while maintaining a stable operation of the wind power system. The results demonstrate that, while preserving an equivalent investment cost to that of supercapacitor banks, wind power systems can significantly increase their FFR contributions. This improvement effectively addresses critical frequency stability challenges in low-inertia grids. Eventually, the proposed method is validated through real-time experiments on a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) setup.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Evolution and Stability Analysis of GFM-Based Renewable Energy Resources Considering Repeated &amp; Continuous Current Saturation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079878</link><description>The current saturation (CS) strategy of grid-forming renewable energy sources (GFM-RESs) is designed to protect the device from overcurrent damages. However, the potential switching processes of control strategies trigger new stability issues. It is revealed that two emerging stability issues, i.e., repeated current saturation (R-CS) and continuous current saturation (C-CS) governed by the inherent inconsistency of switching conditions, will occur when the system operates into the corresponding virtual power angle (VPA) region. This paper adopts the hybrid system theory to analyze such stability issues by deriving the necessary and sufficient switching conditions of current saturation and desaturation. During R-CS, the GFM-RES externally behaves as an abnormal current source, triggering adverse high-frequency oscillations. When subject to C-CS, the system will suffer from persistent overvoltage issues and cannot return to its initial operating point. To identify the stability risks of these two issues and offer guidance for GFM-RES&#8217;s controller design, a novel R&amp;amp;C-CS criterion, along with a generic desaturation region-based (DRB) principle, is proposed. Meanwhile, a switching condition and dynamic characteristic decoupling control (S&amp;amp;D-DC) is developed based on the DRB principle to prevent the R&amp;amp;C-CS issues. High-fidelity electromagnetic transient simulations conducted on both single-machine and multi-machine systems validate the theoretical derivations and proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Interpretable Augmented Ambiguity Set for Quantifying Regional Wind Power Uncertainty in Distributionally Robust Optimal Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082100</link><description>A large-scale grid penetration of wind power has posed severe uncertainty challenges for power system operation. This paper comes up with an interpretable augmented ambiguity set assisted by deep learning for two-stage economic dispatch formulated in a distributionally robust optimization, aiming at precisely representing regional wind power uncertainty. The specifically designed augmented ambiguity set is driven by both the fine-grained uncertainty model of each wind farm and interactive dependencies among different sites. In particular, a multi-teacher knowledge distillation-time generative adversarial network (MKD-time GAN) is presented for the first time to form a spherical ambiguity set gathering all possible distributions for power prediction error of single wind farm. This model leverages a cascaded learning framework by typical teacher-time GANs to jointly educate one general student-time GAN so as to induce a family of comprehensive reference distributions as an ambiguity set. Further, multiple ambiguity sets are mapped into augmented ambiguity set, an interdependent joint probability distribution space for regional prediction error by Nataf transformation. Based on that, a tractable solution algorithm of two-stage optimal dispatch is explicitly derived and saves computation scale. The benefits of both novel MKD-time GAN and decision-making dispatch schemes are demonstrated in IEEE 118-bus systems.</description></item><item><title>Tri-layer Distributed Scheduling for Coastal Integrated Transmission-Distribution-Gas System With Uncertain Typhoons-Affected Offshore Wind Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11075623</link><description>This paper addresses the scheduling challenges associated with offshore wind power within coastal power systems during uncertain typhoons. The proposed tri-layer chance-constrained coordinated scheduling model differs from existing formulations through two major innovations. First, unlike the deterministic scheduling under forecasted typhoons, it implements a scenario-based stochastic programming to address the wind power deviations resulting from the typhoon uncertainties, while additionally factoring in the potential damage to wind turbines. Second, moving beyond the isolated scheduling of thermal units in the transmission network, the proposed model enables a distributed coordination of diverse flexible resources across the distribution and gas networks to mitigate typhoon damage, resulting in a more complex tri-layer scheduling framework. These advancements introduce marked challenges for model solution. To handle this, a mix-sample average approximation method is introduced to reformulate the original random variables involved model into a tractable linear form. Moreover, a novel efficient distributed solution methodology is proposed to tackle the specific nested interactions within the tri-layer scheduling framework. Case studies verify the economic and reliability advantages of the proposed model, with 20.2% average cost saving and over 90% decrease in imbalanced power, as well as the computational superiority of the proposed distributed solution for significantly reduced solution time.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Stage Ultra-Short-Term Wind Power Forecasting Method Based on Transitional Weather Identification and Meteorological Prediction Error Propagation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11078806</link><description>Accurate and reliable wind power forecasting is crucial for the safe and economical operation of power systems. However, under transitional weather conditions, the forecasting errors of meteorological variables such as wind speed tend to increase, introducing significant input noise into wind power prediction models and reducing their reliability. To address this, this paper focuses on analyzing the error propagation mechanism of meteorological input variables and proposes a strategy to improve short-term wind power forecasting accuracy under transitional weather conditions. First, transitional weather periods are identified by analyzing the fluctuation characteristics of multi-dimensional meteorological variables. Then, a two-stage model combining Sparse Variational Gaussian Process (SVGP) and Noisy Input Gaussian Process (NIGP) is proposed. In this model, noisy input data (wind speed predictions) are decomposed into true data (actual wind speed) and noise data (forecast errors), which are modeled independently. By considering the propagation process of input noise in wind power forecasting and making necessary corrections, the SVGP-NIGP model provides more accurate deterministic forecasts and higher-quality interval predictions. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly enhances wind power forecasting accuracy under transitional weather conditions, offering an effective solution to address the uncertainties arising from meteorological forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Self-Optimizing Local Voltage Control of SOP in Active Distribution Networks Based on Lift-Dimension Mapping Linearization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11072306</link><description>The high penetration of distributed generators (DGs) deteriorates the voltage violations in active distribution networks (ADNs). Owing to the flexible adjustment capacity, the local power regulation provided by soft open point (SOP) presents a promising solution for eliminating voltage violations in ADNs. A data-driven local control method can fully excavate the potential logic from operational data without requiring precious network parameters. However, the training data may be insufficient in practical applications. In this paper, a self-optimizing local voltage control method for SOP is proposed to achieve adaptive control in label-poor conditions. First, a SOP local control model is constructed based on lift-dimension mapping linearization (LDML), which portrays the complex relationship between ADN states and SOP control strategies. Subsequently, a self-optimizing guidance mechanism is established to obtain the label data of SOP control strategy, which provides a large number of training samples for the local control model. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated using a practical distribution network with a four-terminal SOP.

However, the integration of GFM without thoroughly considering the interaction between the outer and inner control loops can induce power oscillations. Therefore, this paper offers a systematic sensitivity analysis to explicitly reveal how the control parameters contribute to power oscillations in the GFM-WT system. This analysis is based on a linearized state-space model for the GFM-WT system, incorporating comprehensive system dynamics and control strategies. Furthermore, an optimized control algorithm is developed based on a comprehensive small-signal model, incorporating essential constraints such as the eigenvalue damping ratio and the control loop bandwidth. The algorithm autonomously tunes the control parameters of both the inner and outer loop systems, resulting in optimal parameter values. A comprehensive stability analysis was conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in ensuring system stability. The proposed method is verified through various scenario in modified WSCC 9-bus and New England 39-bus systems. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm effectively mitigates power oscillations in the WT output, subsequently reducing power oscillations in the SG.</description></item><item><title>Deterministic and Probabilistic Forecasting of Wind Power Generation and Ramp Rate With Expectation-Implemented Deep Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11068153</link><description>Accurate day-ahead forecasting of wind power generation, both deterministically and probabilistically, is crucial for reliable and efficient power system operations, and its significance will increase in renewable energy-dominant power systems. Furthermore, inherent variability of wind farms necessitates day-ahead ramp rate forecasting to ensure stable energy balancing. To address these needs, we propose an hourly day-ahead forecasting framework that concurrently predicts the wind power generation and ramp rate. This framework leverages expectation-implemented deep learning models trained by the custom loss functions tailored to the different signal attributes and our distinct expectations. Additional strategies, such as feature generation and a feedforward error learning model, are implemented to enhance forecasting performance while maintaining a balance between tasks. Finally, our framework integrates heterogeneous generation and ramp rate forecasting results, incorporating probabilistic ramp rate forecasting derived from the synthesized output. We validate our approach using real wind power data and assess the impact of each proposed method individually. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly contribute to identifying the intrinsic volatility of wind power, thereby fully exploiting its potential benefits.</description></item><item><title>Optimal BESS Management for Peak Load Shaving and Battery Health Under Prediction Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11071638</link><description>In modern power grids, integrating renewable energy sources (RESs), deploying battery energy storage systems (BESSs) is increasingly vital for mitigating power fluctuations. However, optimizing BESS operation remains challenging amidst uncertainties in both RES and load forecasting. This paper proposes a novel stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) framework for BESS operation, focusing on peak load shaving and battery health while addressing prediction uncertainties. The proposed framework employs a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network for forecasting and integrates a constraint-tightening technique into a stochastic optimization (SO) problem with a receding horizon. Based on the load profile of a company in Germany, the proposed framework achieves an additional reduction of 99 kW (5.8%) in peak grid take-out power compared with the traditional model predictive control (MPC) approach, demonstrating its advantage in addressing uncertainties.</description></item><item><title>PMU-Based Power Oscillation Damping Control for Renewable Energy System With Communication Disruption and Multi-Time Delays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11071336</link><description>This paper presents a novel model-free power oscillation damping strategy for renewable energy (RE) system considering communication disruption and multiple time delays in control loops. First, a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process-enabled online estimation method is developed for state-space modeling estimation only using measurement data. This estimation method is applicable to systems with different delays in each wide-area control loop. Subsequently, a novel wide-area power oscillation damper (POD) is designed for the renewable energy sources (RESs) and that is further reconstructed in a decomposition manner to achieve independently sub-control, which allows to retain better damping performance under communication disruption. After that, the POD parameter settings are carefully tuned, where the time delay and estimation error are considered, formulated as stability constraints using Razumikhin theorem, and solved via linear matrix inequality (LMI), yielding multi-dimensional robustness of the system, including operating conditions, time delay and communication disruption. Case studies in the improved 4-machine 2-area system and IEEE 39-bus system show that the proposed method can accurately estimate the state-space modeling of closed-loop system and effectively dampen power oscillations in time delay and communication disruption scenarios.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Method for Assessing Frequency Support Capability of Diverse Renewable Power Generation Units</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11061796</link><description>The proliferation of renewable power generation units (RGUs) deteriorates the physical inertia of the system, making the evaluation of unit-level frequency support capability (FSC) and system-level frequency stability increasingly important. However, the prior-art approaches lack a standardized framework for FSC assessment, and the non-disclosure of RGU information by manufacturers exacerbates this challenge. To address these issues, this paper proposes a unified transfer function structure (UTFS) model and its parameter solving method based on impedance measurement, enabling a unified assessment of both the unit-level FSC and system-level frequency stability. The unit-level UTFS can be obtained through frequency-domain approaches, e.g., xy-impedance measurements. Moreover, the system-level UTFS can be acquired through the simple aggregation of unit-level UTFS. Without detailed models or post-event data, the proposed framework uniformly represents the FSC of various RGUs through three key indicators: effective inertia, damping, and primary frequency regulation (PFR). Furthermore, the proposed method analytically derives system frequency indicators: frequency nadir, rate of change of frequency (RoCoF), and steady-state frequency deviation. Numerical simulations and analysis of the operational data of a provincial power grid are provided to validate the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Timescale Operational Optimization for Mobile Charging Solutions Considering Voltage Regulation Support for ADN: A Two-Stage Coordination Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051060</link><description>To alleviate the pressure of traditional fixed charging methods, mobile charging solutions have emerged in recent years. This article presents a two-stage coordination approach for mobile charging robots (MCRs) and active distribution networks (ADN). In the first stage, we maximize the total revenue for the MCRs from providing charging services for electric vehicles (EVs) and interacting with the ADN within a frame-based time scale, where the duration of each frame is determined by the charging decisions of MCRs. Furthermore, we consider the long-term objectives of meeting the battery energy deficit constraint for each MCR, thereby improving their battery life. Lyapunov optimization is utilized to transform frame-based scheduling into an optimization problem within a specified time slot, simplifying the process of solving the optimization problem. To avoid affecting charging efficiency when MCRs interact with the power grid, we use the reactive power of free MCRs to provide voltage regulation support for the ADN, improving power quality and minimizing total network loss simultaneously. Decoupling active and reactive power in two stages ensures both the profitability of the MCRs cluster and the voltage security of the ADN, resulting in a win-win situation. The simulation results, based on the 18-bus and 51-bus distribution networks, confirm the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Assessing Grid Penalized Reinforcement Learning for Renewable Energy Management of Power-to-X Integrated With Intermediate Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051013</link><description>This research explores the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based planning strategies of power-to-X (PtX) systems under uncertainties of renewable and price through a detailed case study and comparative analysis of system planning. A DRL-based hourly planning model is proposed to minimize operational costs for a PtX system, incorporating a hybrid energy storage system. The model employs a grid-penalized reward function to manage grid power usage while accounting for temporal uncertainties in renewable and grid prices. To analyze the DRL model&#8217;s planning strategies, it is compared to a general rule-based model across varying spatial and temporal uncertainties using real-world data from national (France) areas. The results show that the DRL-based planning approach consistently outperforms the rule-based model, achieving 1,360.12% higher monthly profits in the national area, though with a relatively lower renewable energy penetration (REP). However, sensitivity analysis reveals that increasing the grid penalty level effectively reduces the gap in REP while sustaining higher profitability. This comparative analysis is the first to quantitatively reveal the planning strategies of a DRL-based PtX system, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing grid power overuse while maintaining higher profitability in system planning.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Proximal Policy Optimization With Embedded Dual Rules for Power Systems Considering Wind and Photovoltaic Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11059762</link><description>Most renewable energy power systems are created to provide more resilient, reliable, economical, sustainable and secure power support services for loads. However, owing to the inherent forecasting errors of wind and photovoltaic (PV) power, existing optimal dispatch decisions based on forecasting errors have biases. To address this issue, this paper proposes the distributed proximal policy optimization (DPPO) model with embedded dual rules for optimal power dispatch that considers wind and PV power forecasting error correction. The proposed model embeds forecasting and error correction information into the DPPO state space. Moreover, considering the physical characteristics and operational security constraints of the power grid, power balance and flow constraints are embedded in the DPPO network in a regular form. Finally, by integrating the established rules, wind and PV forecasting, and error correction information, the proposed model achieves optimal dispatch decisions through the calculation of state and execution of prescribed actions. The proposed method is applied and tested on a modified IEEE-30 bus system using actual data from a provincial power grid. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses optimal dispatch decisions caused by wind and PV forecasting errors. Compared with three other advanced methods, the proposed approach has significant advantages in promoting wind power accommodation, reducing operating costs, and enhancing the adaptability of optimal dispatch to uncertainty.</description></item><item><title>An End-to-End Ensemble Learning Approach for Enhancing Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048619</link><description>Accurate wind power forecasts are crucial for grid stability, thereby ensuring a reliable and efficient power supply. To characterize the complicated fluctuation of wind power, numerous ensemble models with multiple base forecasters have been developed. However, most existing ensemble forecasting models contain several modeling stages, which increases the risk of error accumulation and inefficiency in model training. Moreover, the limited number of base forecasters results in forecasts with reduced diversity, thereby diminishing the performance of ensemble models. To address these challenges, MG-DS, a simple but efficient end-to-end ensemble learning model based on the Dempster-Shafer (DS) evidence theory, is proposed to unify base model learning and ensemble learning into a single process. It comprises an all-MLP-based nonlinear feature extraction module, a GRU and cross attention-based base forecast generation module, and a DS-based self-ensemble forecasting module with a DS-based magnifying glass to enhance the diversity of base forecasts. Further, a DS-based self-ensemble (DSSE) plugin is proposed to integrate the trained RNN-type and non-RNN-type base forecasters. Experiments on five wind power datasets show that MG-DS outperforms popular wind power forecasting models and ensemble techniques, and the effectiveness of the DSSE plugin is also validated in enhancing the performance of ensemble wind power forecasting.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Distributed Incentive Mechanism for Integrated Electricity and Heat Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045415</link><description>Coordination between electric power systems (EPS) and district heating systems (DHS) integrates more renewable energy and improves economic benefits. However, the dispatch of integrated electricity and heat systems (IEHS) raises privacy and incentive concerns. To address these issues, we propose a fully distributed incentive mechanism for IEHS. Specifically, the combined heat and power dispatch (CHPD) model is transformed into a monotone variational inequality (MVI) and solved by a fully distributed predictor-corrector algorithm (FDPCA). With FDPCA, the EPS and DHS operators can dispatch independently. Additionally, we use a novel two-stage benefit allocation approach based on Nash bargaining to distribute profits while simplifying computational complexity. Case studies demonstrate that the fully distributed incentive mechanism effectively protects privacy, enhances efficiency, and promotes cooperation.</description></item><item><title>Adaptable Parameters Estimation for Microgrid Distributed Energy Resources Using Modified Physics-Informed Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045087</link><description>Parameters estimation in microgrids remains challenging due to ambiguous system dynamics brought by distributed energy resources (DERs) and scarcity of data. This study presents a modified physics-informed neural network (PINN) paradigmdesigned for parameters estimation under such constraints. This paper introduces two main innovations: First, by combining small-signal analysis with the PINN framework for ordinary differential equations, we introduce an adaptable parameter estimation paradigm applicable to different types of DERs in microgrid. Second, we introduce a modified data transformation that reduces training time by up to 82.87% compared to traditional PINN approaches at best. To validate our approach, we conducted simulation on two typical system setups based on open-source real-world microgrid using real-time digital simulation to generate data. We evaluate the proposed method by using an error margin below 5% as a key metric to confirm its robustness and accuracy for different types of DERs. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method across varying ordinary differential equations to diverse mathematical models. Additionally, suboptimal and failed cases are analyzed and discussed to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the method&#8217;s limitations.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Fractional Programming-Based Planning Model for 100% Renewable Poly-Generation of Electricity and Methanol</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045219</link><description>Engaging in long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) with renewable energy producers (REPs) is a promising strategy for decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors, such as internet data centers. However, due to the inherent volatility and intermittency of renewable energy sources (RES), REPs typically require substantial over-installation of capacity to meet fixed PPA delivery commitments, resulting in significant energy curtailment and increased supply costs. Power-to-methanol (P2M) offers a viable pathway for large-scale integration of RES by providing flexible chemical storage and demand. This study proposes a unified planning framework for the 100% renewable poly-generation of electricity and methanol, considering both flexible and inflexible loads. The objective is to maximize the internal rate of return (IRR), a key metric for investment decision-making. To this end, a mixed-integer linear fractional programming (MILFP) model is developed and solved in a computationally tractable manner. The model is validated using real-world data. Results show that the proposed approach significantly improves IRR, reduces RES curtailment, and lowers the levelized costs of both electricity and methanol. Furthermore, the model effectively coordinates electricity delivery under PPA constraints with methanol synthesis, offering an economically robust solution for renewable energy utilization and sector coupling.</description></item><item><title>Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning Method for Volt/Var Control in Active Distribution Network With Safe Operation Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045109</link><description>In recent years, distributed energy resources (DERs) in power systems have been increasingly integrated into the distribution network. DERs will improve the flexibility and economy of active distribution networks (ADNs) while introducing increased complexity and challenges in maintaining stable and efficient system operations. The traditional voltage regulation methods struggle to cope with these complexities, highlighting the need for more advanced and adaptive control strategies for fast-response PVs and battery energy storage systems (BESS). This paper proposes a novel Human-in-the-loop deep reinforcement learning (HITL-DRL) framework for Volt/Var control in ADNs, addressing the limitations of the existing approaches by integrating human experience and knowledge into the learning process. Additionally, a Security-Clipped Proximal Policy Optimization (SC-PPO) algorithm is introduced to ensure safe operation during reinforcement learning. The paper explores three human-intervention strategies: human demonstration, human feedback, and setting adversary, which enhance the learning process by leveraging expert knowledge and experience. The proposed HITL-DRL framework demonstrates improved convergence speed, robustness, reduced exploration risk, and increased interpretability and trust, paving the way for more effective voltage regulation in complex power systems. The proposed HITL-DRL method is verified in the IEEE 33-bus system, demonstrating superior performance over standard DRL algorithms in terms of training speed and robustness, achieving the highest average reward and the second-fastest computational time. Compared to traditional PPO, our method significantly excels in managing unforeseen contingencies, resulting in a lower voltage violation rate of 73.4%. Compared with the model-based method, the strategy of HITL-DRL is very close to that of optimization results in terms of energy loss and voltage violation rates. However, HITL-DRL shows advantages in decision-making time, responding within 1 millisecond, which is capable of rapidly adapting to time-vary changes in ADNs.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Flexibility Aggregation of Heterogeneous Demand-Side Energy Storages for Secondary Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11044873</link><description>Demand-side energy storages (DESs), such as household batteries and electric vehicles (EVs), have shown great potential in providing fast frequency regulation services. This paper proposes a three-layer hierarchical flexibility aggregation framework to fully evaluate and reliably realize the aggregate flexibility of heterogeneous DESs for secondary frequency regulation (SFR). At the device layer, the regulation capacity of an individual DES is modeled as a two-dimensional feasible region, with the real-time state-of-charge (SoC) constraint and the statistical features of regulation signals well considered. On this basis, heterogeneous DESs are divided into several clusters according to the geometry of their feasible region. At the cluster layer, regulation capacity, dynamic response model as well as regulation costs are efficiently aggregated within each DES cluster by prototype-based maximum inner approximation (MIA). At the aggregator layer, an analytical expression of the multi-cluster coordinated SFR flexibility can be formulated by convex optimizations at each feasible operating point, which provides a comprehensive model for DES aggregators to economically participate in SFR. Comparative simulations validate that the proposed method can accurately capture the aggregate SFR flexibility of heterogeneous DESs with lower flexibility loss and affordable computational burden, while the disaggregation feasibility of aggregate flexibility is further demonstrated using real-world regulation signals.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Autonomous Control for Global Economic Operation of AC/DC Microgrid Clusters Interconnected by Flexible DC Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045308</link><description>This paper presents a distributed autonomous control strategy for AC/DC microgrid clusters interconnected by the flexible DC distribution network to simultaneously achieve the global economic operation and frequency/voltage control of the system while complying with the power limits of DGs and interlinking converters.

Mobile wind turbines (MWTs) are uniquely positioned to navigate transportation systems, being towed by trucks, and supply energy to power distribution systems (PDSs). This flexibility enables MWTs to serve as emergency power sources, thereby contributing to enhancing the system resilience by facilitating service restoration following extreme events. This paper presents a novel framework based on Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) to dispatch MWTs for service restoration. Deep Q-learning (DQL) and Double Deep Q-learning (DDQL) approaches are implemented within the agent for training and comparison purposes. Additionally, an action limitation is incorporated into the proposed framework in order to mitigate the influence of wind power fluctuations. Case studies conducted on an integrated power-transport system, comprising a Sioux Falls transportation system and four IEEE 33-bus test systems, illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed restoration scheduling policy in enhancing PDSs&#8217; resilience against disasters.</description></item><item><title>Robust Unit Commitment With Multi-State Uncertainty: A Novel Formulation and Scalable Solution Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045107</link><description>To mitigate the conservatism of scheduling schemes derived from the two-stage robust unit commitment model (TS-RUCM), this paper proposes a novel multi-state uncertainty set (MSUS) considering the uncertain wind power output (WPO). The MSUS formulates WPO uncertainties with higher resolution by introducing multiple discrete state values within the uncertain interval. Additionally, the MSUS limits extreme fluctuations of WPO uncertainties among state values through transition indicators embedded in multiple transition constraints. The state values and transition indicators are calculated using the conditional quantile regression technique and Markov chain analysis. This systematic and scientific approach allows the MSUS to effectively exclude low-probability WPO scenarios, thereby significantly mitigating the conservatism of the scheduling schemes. Moreover, to accelerate the computation of the TS-RUCM based on the MSUS, this paper proposes an improved inexact column and constraint generation (II-C&amp;amp;CG) method. The II-C&amp;amp;CG method employs an adaptive tolerance strategy and refined backtracking to solve master and subproblems inexactly while ensuring finite convergence, significantly reducing computational time. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of both the MSUS and the II-C&amp;amp;CG method.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Artificial Intelligence and Physics-Based Modeling for Long-Term Cascaded Hydropower Scheduling Under Extreme Heat Events</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11059276</link><description>The operation of hydropower plants are significantly challenged by extreme heatwave events. This paper integrates artificial intelligence and a physics-based model to introduce an efficient long-term scheduling framework aimed at maximizing hydropower generation during extreme heat events. The water values derived from the proposed long-term scheduling model can be used in developing effective strategies for short-term hydropower scheduling. A physics-based evaporation model (PEM), which captures key land-atmosphere interactions, is developed to account for significant variations in reservoir evaporation rates during extreme heat events. A multivariate long short-term memory (M-LSTM) forecasting model is also utilized to predict the key input parameters required for both the PEM and the long-term scheduling problem. A regression-based machine learning algorithm is also utilized to estimate the hydropower production function, which enables linear integration of the nonlinear and nonconvex behavior of hydropower plant in the mixed-integer linear formulation of the scheduling problem. The proposed model is applied to a case study of eleven cascaded hydropower units located on the Columbia river. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed long-term scheduling model effectively manages reservoir operations, mitigating the adverse impacts of extreme heat events on hydropower generation and operator profitability.</description></item><item><title>Chance-Constrained Optimization for VPPs With Base Stations Considering Diverse Communication Rate Requirements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082584</link><description>5G Base Stations (BSs) consume a large amount of electricity, requiring predominantly green power, which brings huge pressure on their electricity costs. To reduce energy costs and carbon emissions, aggregating 5G BSs (Macro BS and Micro BS), and distributed renewable energy into virtual power plants (VPPs) to participate in market transactions has become a trend. However, the operation of VPPs faces challenges: the uncertainty of renewable energy output and the unclear regulation mechanism of BSs. Consequently, this paper focuses on developing an optimal scheduling strategy for VPPs, considering the schedulability of BSs and the uncertainty of internal renewable energy. Firstly, the flexibility of BSs with 4G and 5G modules is investigated, particularly in terms of transceivers and backup energy storage. The communication rates of BSs are modeled to evaluate the impact of active transceiver numbers on user experience. A dynamic time-domain model of backup energy storage capacity considering communication load is proposed. The impact of user mobility and overlapping coverage areas of BSs on communication rates is considered to be more in line with real-world scenarios. Subsequently, an optimization model is developed for VPPs to maximize the profit of engaging BSs in the day-ahead market transaction, considering diverse communication rate requirements. The optimization model determines the schedule of transceivers, backup energy storage, and other resources. Then, to control the operational risks associated with the uncertainty of internal distributed renewable energy outputs, the chance constraint is introduced. Furthermore, the Taylor expansion-based algorithm is applied to coordinately solve the VPP dispatching problem. Numerical simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed models, which achieve a 5.4% increase in the proportion of internal renewable energy consumption and a 18.72% increase in economic benefits.</description></item><item><title>Synthetic Inertia Control for a Wind Turbine Generator Based on Event Size and Rotor Speed</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045832</link><description>To enhance the frequency nadir without causing the excessive deceleration of the rotor speed (${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$), synthetic inertia control (SIC) schemes of a wind turbine generator (WTG) need to provide incremental power in response to event magnitude and ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$. Conventional stepwise SIC approaches face limitations during large events due to the increase of predefined incremental power, which does not match the actual event size. This paper presents an SIC strategy for WTGs that adjusts incremental power in relation to event size and ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$. During the frequency-support phase, the incremental power is modulated based on the frequency deviation, along with a control gain proportional to ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$, rather than the rate of change of frequency. While this approach accounts for the power imbalance, it remains vulnerable to noise and delays in practical applications. After the frequency-support phase, the proposed method decreases the active power reference in accordance with ${{{{\omega }}}_{{r}}}$, ensuring it stabilizes within a secure operating range. Following stabilization, the WTG transitions smoothly back to maximum power point tracking operation. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach significantly enhances the frequency nadir during large events, even under low wind conditions, while avoiding excessive deceleration of the rotor speed.</description></item><item><title>Prototype Federated Reinforcement Learning for Voltage Regulation in Distribution Systems With Physics-Aware Spatial-Temporal Graph Perception</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045127</link><description>Online voltage regulation in active distribution systems faces challenges stemming from privacy protection concerns and uncertainties introduced by renewable energy sources. To address these issues, a novel spatial-temporal transformer-based prototype federated reinforcement learning (STT-PFRL) model is proposed to mitigate voltage deviations while ensuring data privacy. Specifically, STT-PFRL operating within a decentralized framework trains the model by transmitting local prototype information between a central data server and local agents, avoiding raw data privacy leakage. Besides, a novel physics-aware spatial-temporal transformer network is proposed to improve the voltage regulation policy learning stability against uncertainties by embedding the spatial-temporal graphical physics information into the data aggregation process. Furthermore, the prototype learning-based federated soft actor-critic (ProtoFedSAC) algorithm incorporates a prototype layer to utilize diverse feature representations, thereby enhancing the model&#8217;s ability to handle heterogeneity in environmental data. Simulation results on 33- and 118-node distribution systems demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of STT-PFRL in voltage regulation.</description></item><item><title>County-Level Distributed PV Day-Ahead Power Prediction Based on Grey Correlation Analysis and Transformer-GCAN Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11061797</link><description>The distributed photovoltaic (PV) power stations within the entire county exist spatiotemporal correlation. Merely considering temporal correlation makes it challenging to meet the day-ahead scheduling demands. This paper proposes a distributed PV county-level day-ahead power prediction method based on grey relational analysis and the Transformer-Graph Convolutional Attention Network (Transformer-GCAN) model. Firstly, the grey relational degree is used to measure the relevance between each distributed PV stations, and the connection relationship of the station graph is determined based on the analysis results. Secondly, the Transformer network is utilized to extract the temporal features of each PV sequence in the graph. Based on the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model, a Graph Attention Mechanism (GAT) is introduced to dynamically extract spatial features between each photovoltaic station in the graph. Finally, the integration of spatiotemporal features is achieved through a fully connected neural network, enabling day-ahead power prediction at the county level. Case analysis results demonstrate that compared with the Transformer-GCN model, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the power prediction model proposed in this paper is reduced by 11.90%, 15.72% and 19.61% respectively in sunny days, cloudy days and rainy days.</description></item><item><title>Power Capacity Allocation Among Multiple Renewable Power Plants: A Perspective From System Strength</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11122291</link><description>Large-scale renewable energy projects consisting of renewable power plants (RPPs) managed by different stakeholders may suffer weak system strength. Consequently, only a limited amount of renewable power capacity can be delivered, or the insufficient system strength could incur stability issues. The allocation of system strength constrained power capacity among different RPPs deserves investigation, which is critical to their respective benefits. To this end, the system strength demand of each RPP is quantified based on its allowable power capacity. A power capacity allocation approach is proposed, ensuring that the RPPs efficiently and fairly utilize system strength. Case studies show that RPPs with longer electrical distances deliver less renewable capacity due to their greater impact on system strength.</description></item><item><title>Nonsmooth Decentralized Voltage Controller for Constrained Regulation of DC Microgrids With Constant Power Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168949</link><description>This paper presents a novel decentralized voltage controller that enforces state constrains at all times and significantly enhances the transient response of DC Microgrid networks with constant power loads. The structure of the proposed controller ensures the existence of a positive invariant set under the solution of the dynamics, enforcing boundedness of each nodal voltage around a rated value. A rigorous analysis is presented to formulate sufficient conditions on the controller tuning parameters such that the boundedness property is guaranteed despite the time-varying nature of the nonlinear load demand. Closed-loop stability of the entire DC Microgrid with respect to desired reference points is analytically proven by employing a suitable Lyapunov function. This allows us to estimate the region of attraction of the desired equilibrium and obtain conditions under which system stability is ensured at all times. Furthermore, the structure of the proposed controller significantly improves the convergence rate of the closed loop system when compared with similar approaches in the literature. The theoretic results are verified in both experimental and power hardware-in-the-loop testing scenarios, while demonstrating fast voltage restoration in cases of load demand fluctuations and constrained regulation to the desired voltage References.</description></item><item><title>A Control Strategy of Multi-Terminal Grid-Forming Soft Open Point for Uninterrupted Power Supply Under Feeder Power Outages</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11173992</link><description>This paper proposes a control strategy of the multi-terminal grid-forming soft open point (MGSOP), aimed to ensure uninterrupted power supply during distribution feeder outages. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed control does not rely on an ideal DC voltage assumption, master-slave structure, or control mode switching. In the MGSOP, the AC-DC and DC-DC converters are used for multi-feeder interconnections and energy storage integration. The MGSOP control system comprises local and coordinating controllers, used to implement the proposed control strategy, which is made up of three sections: 1) Grid-forming AC voltage control implemented by local controllers, which ensures the independent construction of AC voltage and prevents control switching between grid-connected and standalone modes. 2) Hierarchical DC voltage control collaborated by both local and coordinating controllers. Based on the multi dynamic of DC voltage ( $\Delta U_{dc}$  and dUdc/dt), the control ensures dynamic DC power balance and DC voltage stability, avoiding system instability and restoration failures caused by the shutdown of the master converter under traditional master-slave control. 3) Coordinated control for the power regulation among multiple feeders, which reduces the consumption of energy storage during supply restorations. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated by simulations.</description></item><item><title>CommonPower: A Framework for Safe Data-Driven Smart Grid Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11186797</link><description>The growing complexity of power system management has led to an increased interest in reinforcement learning (RL). To validate their effectiveness, RL algorithms have to be evaluated across multiple case studies. Case study design is an arduous task requiring the consideration of many aspects, among them the influence of available forecasts and the level of decentralization in the control structure. Furthermore, vanilla RL controllers cannot themselves ensure the satisfaction of system constraints, which makes devising a safeguarding mechanism a necessary task for every case study before deploying the system. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the Python tool CommonPower, the first general framework for the modeling and simulation of power system management tailored towards machine learning. Its modular architecture enables users to focus on specific elements without having to implement a simulation environment. Another unique contribution of CommonPower is the automatic synthesis of model predictive controllers and safeguards. Beyond offering a unified interface for single-agent RL, multi-agent RL, and optimal control, CommonPower includes a training pipeline for machine-learning-based forecasters as well as a flexible mechanism for incorporating feedback of safeguards into the learning updates of RL controllers.</description></item><item><title>Chattering-Free Robust Terminal Sliding Mode Control for DC Nanogrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11197018</link><description>DC nanogrid is an emerging solution for providing affordable electricity to rural areas and homes equipped with solar panels, power converters, and on-site batteries. However, its poor transient response limits its practical application, presenting a significant drawback. This paper proposes a chattering-free robust terminal sliding mode control with finite time stability for the DC nanogrid. The proposed control strategy effectively addresses issues such as poor transient response and chattering, thereby ensuring optimal operation of the DC nanogrid. To achieve robust closed-loop power system operation, advanced nonlinear sliding surfaces and control laws are designed. This work focuses on achieving robustness against dynamic changes and system uncertainties caused by the intermittent nature of the renewable generation unit, instantaneous load variation, and saturation of the control laws. The finite-time stability of the closed-loop system is proved using Lyapunov theory to ensure finite-time convergence for both the reaching and sliding phases. The effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear controller is demonstrated by comparing it with higher-order SMC and conventional asymptotic SMC. System behavior is analyzed through MATLAB/Simulink simulations, and practical applicability is validated experimentally using an IMPERIX hardware setup.</description></item><item><title>Large-Signal Stability Analysis of Multi-Stack Fuel Cell Hybrid Power Systems With Virtual Inertia-Based Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11197052</link><description>Multi-stack fuel cell (FC) hybrid power systems (MSFCHPSs) are high-order nonlinear systems with inherently complex nonlinear characteristics due to their integration of multiple FC stacks, power electronic converters, and nonlinear loads. Thus, MSFCHPSs are very vulnerable to destabilization by transient disturbances, which exceeds the capabilities of traditional small signal stability analysis. To explore the destabilization mechanism of MSFCHPSs, this article proposes a comprehensive large-signal stability (LSS) analysis framework integrating a full-order nonlinear model, including all main circuits, complete control loops, and FC aging effects, with virtual inertia-based control. The nonlinear system is transformed into a Takagi&#8211;Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy representation, enabling domain of attraction (DOA) estimation via Lyapunov theory and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) with low computational burden and reduced conservatism. The method quantitatively assesses the influence of power distribution, virtual inertia parameters, circuit elements, control gains, and FC aging on LSS, identifying dominant stability factors. A hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) platform is developed to experimentally validate the proposed approach. Results show strong agreement between estimated and actual stability boundaries, confirming the method&#8217;s accuracy and practical applicability for MSFCHPS design and operation.</description></item><item><title>Artificial Intelligence Data Driven Control for DC Solid State Transformer in DC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11215658</link><description>The DC solid-state transformer (DCSST) serves as a key component for connecting power supplies, loads, and other elements in a DC microgrid system. With the integration of new energy sources and random loads, the system has become increasingly complex, making accurate modeling challenging due to high modeling costs. The randomness of the loads introduces various disturbances, compromising system stability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a data-driven model-free control (DMFC) approach based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and an improved Kalman filter (IKF) for the DCSST. First, a data-driven model of the DCSST is established. Next, the IKF is designed, which is tailored for DMFC to correct measurement errors, filter noise, and estimate uncertain disturbances. Subsequently, the DMFC is introduced, which ensures stability under large signal disturbances without relying on an accurate system model. Finally, a DRL sub-controller is integrated into the DMFC to intelligently adjust the control signal and enhance the system&#8217;s operational adaptability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control method can adaptively ensure the stability of the system under large signal disturbances without requiring an accurate model, while also exhibiting good dynamic and steady-state performance.</description></item><item><title>Visual-Based Reinforcement Learning for Voltage Regulation and Attack Mitigation in Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11173844</link><description>The growing integration of distributed generators introduces increased vulnerability to cyber threats in modern power distribution systems, especially false data injection attacks (FDIAs) targeting communication network. This paper presents a novel real-time voltage regulation framework that enhances both system security and operational efficiency under FDIA scenarios. A time-frequency visual (TFV) model is first developed to identify FDIA types and accurately detect their duration in real-time. Based on the detection outcomes, a redirected control mechanism is employed to correct compromised control signals. These components are embedded into a Markov decision process (MDP) that guides voltage regulation strategies. To solve the MDP, an attention-based multi-agent soft actor-critic (AMS) algorithm is introduced, leveraging attention mechanisms to enhance decision-making under complex and uncertain environments. Integrating the TFV and AMS modules, a visual-based reinforcement learning (VRL) approach is formulated for robust and adaptive voltage control. Extensive simulations conducted on a modified IEEE 33-bus system using real-world synchrophasor data demonstrate that the proposed method effectively contains voltage deviations within 0.02085 p.u., significantly improving the resilience of the distribution network against cyberattacks.</description></item><item><title>A Safe Combined Reinforcement Learning and Model Predictive Control Scheme for Utility-Level Battery Control in Distribution Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11193800</link><description>Optimally controlling energy storage systems is essential for the integration of renewables and electromobility in future power grids. Such control schemes may need to satisfy lookahead requirements for the batteries state-of-charge so as to ensure a smooth grid operation. Model predictive control (MPC) is traditionally used to solve these type of problems suffering however from long runtimes and the need of fine-tuned forecasts. Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are considered as alternatives but usually cannot guarantee constraints satisfaction. To overcome the limitations of both MPC and RL, in this work, a novel method that integrates RL into MPC is proposed leading to a fast real-time control scheme that aims to enforce near-future constraints satisfaction and accounts for lookahead constraints in the current decisions. Due to the inclusion of the RL-based learned value function in the MPC cost, traditional optimization solutions do not apply and the application of the cross-entropy-method (CEM) is suggested. Its runtime is reduced to the time scale of seconds by employing appropriate initialization based on RL decisions as well as an exponentially decaying amount of samples. Numerical comparisons show that the proposed method outperforms MPC and other safe RL schemes in terms of cost performance and constraints violations.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Placement of Smart Hybrid Transformers in Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224498</link><description>Hybrid transformers are a relatively new technology that combine conventional power transformers with power electronics to provide voltage and reactive power control capabilities in distribution networks. This paper proposes a novel method of determining the optimal location and utilisation of hybrid transformers in 3-phase distribution networks to maximise the net present value of hybrid transformers based on their ability to increase the export of power produced by distributed generators over their operational lifespan. This has been accomplished through sequential linear programming, a key feature of which is the consideration of nonlinear characteristics and constraints relating to hybrid transformer power electronics and control capabilities. Test cases were carried out in a modified version of the Cigre European Low Voltage Distribution Network Benchmark, which has been extended by connecting it with two additional low voltage distribution test networks. All test case results demonstrate that the installation and utilisation of hybrid transformers can improve the income earned from exporting excess active power, justifying their installation cost (with the highest net present value being (6.56 million, resulting from a 45.53% increase in estimated annual profits due to coordinated HT compensation).</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Operational Strategy for Ice Thermal Storage District Cooling Systems via Model-Free Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11184258</link><description>District cooling system (DCS) offers centralized cooling services for building groups that significantly reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. However, existing model-based methods struggle with the large-scale, stochastic, and nonlinear characteristics of the DCS optimization problem under strict time limits. To fill this research gap, this paper proposes a model-free safe deep reinforcement learning (MFS-DRL) algorithm for the DCS to deliver real-time scheduling strategies of multiple chillers and ice thermal storage units under varying operating conditions. The problem is modeled as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) to systematically decouple the objective from the constraint, therefore overcoming the confusion between reward and penalty caused by manual penalty coefficients in traditional DRL methods. Moreover, prior expert knowledge is acquired through the interior point optimizer (IPOPT) solver, and the agent is pre-trained using imitation learning (IL) to mitigate exploration disorder and local convergence in the early training stage. Ultimately, the Lagrangian relaxation approach is applied to modify the optimality criteria and gradient update rules of the classic deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, thereby achieving a trade-off between feasibility and optimality. Numerical experiments on 12-node and 619-node DCSs demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms representative model-based and data-driven baselines, delivering high-quality solutions within only milliseconds and maintaining robustness across hyperparameter variations.</description></item><item><title>Load Prediction of Hydrogen Powered Ship: A Deep Prediction Framework Considering Operating Environment and Error Correction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11187418</link><description>The load prediction for the future period can serve as an important reference for ship navigation planning. However, the small displacement of hydrogen powered ships and the complex operating environment and conditions pose a serious challenge to load prediction. This study develops an advanced load forecasting framework for hydrogen energy ships by integrating navigation data with hydro-meteorological conditions, proposing a novel strategy that combines classified load prediction with unified error correction. The methodology begins with Spearman correlation analysis to identify critical features for both propulsion and maintenance loads. LightGBM models then generate rapid preliminary predictions for these load categories, employing continuous training to enhance computational efficiency while producing initial forecast sequences. The framework&#8217;s key innovation is the Int-ConvGRU network, which implements error correction through a parallel architecture that simultaneously processes historical data and preliminary predictions while preserving precise temporal relationships. This unique design significantly improves prediction accuracy by effectively capturing complex temporal dependencies. Comprehensive validation using data from hydrogen-powered vessels demonstrates the framework&#8217;s superior performance against multiple benchmark models, particularly in handling the distinct load characteristics of modern ships.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Time-Domain Hierarchical Scheduling of Integrated Energy Systems With Frequency Decomposition Considering Large-Scale Grid Connection of Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192655</link><description>Amid global decarbonization efforts, Integrated Energy Systems (IES) face critical challenges from the inherent uncertainties of high-penetration renewable energy sources and the large-scale, potentially disorderly integration of Electric Vehicles (EVs), leading to significant supply-demand imbalances and system volatility. Existing approaches struggle to effectively coordinate diverse device response times and capture complex EV user behavior. To address these, this paper proposes a multi-time domain control model-driven bi-level optimization framework for Integrated Energy Systems. The upper level employs a multi-objective intelligent algorithm to generate Pareto-optimal solutions balancing economic costs and environmental impacts. The lower level implements a singular perturbation theory-based multi-time domain control model, dynamically partitioning devices into fast/slow subsystems for differentiated scheduling, significantly enhancing resilience against uncertainties. Additionally, a prospect theory-driven EV dynamic charging response model accurately incorporates user psychology (e.g., loss aversion) to guide orderly charging via price incentives. Furthermore, a Fourier-based power decoupling strategy for hybrid storage (LIB-SC) reduces battery degradation by 28.7%. Case studies demonstrate superior performance: a 12.2% reduction in economic costs, an 11.5% reduction in emissions, and robustly maintained system volatility below 5% under extreme uncertainties, showcasing significant advancements in balancing economic-environmental objectives while accommodating high renewable and EV penetration.</description></item><item><title>Interpretable and Accurate Multi-Energy Loads Forecasting via Continuous-Time Modeling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11195784</link><description>High-precision interpretable forecasting of multi-energy loads is crucial for planning and optimizing Integrated Energy Systems (IES). Current methods have three key limitations: 1) reliance on closed-box models obscures feature interactions; 2) traditional modal decomposition methods ignore cross-modal correlations and fail to efficiently extract global cycle-trend characteristics; 3) limitations in sampling frequency prevent capturing fast dynamic characteristics of energy loads. To address these, we propose a dual resolution channel multi-period cross reconstruction parallel closed-form continuous-time network (DMP-PCFC) for multi-energy load forecasting. This method includes a multi-period cross-reconstruction network which equivalent to the signal sifter for decoupling original sequences and nonlinear mapping across periods, and models hidden states of energy loads using neuron state iterative differential equations. A parallel Closed-form continuous-time neural network (PCFC) based on chunked parallelization reduces inference time from  $O(T)$  (change with input sequence length) to  $O(P)$  (fixed cycle length). To overcome inherent sampling resolution limitations, a dual-resolution channel model with weight-sharing PCFC is used for simultaneous inference. Extensive experiments and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) on the IES dataset at Arizona State University&#8217;s Tempe campus show that DMP-PCFC offers higher prediction accuracy and greater interpretability than existing methods, providing a new paradigm for downstream tasks based on other research methods, making it valuable for IES engineering applications.

However, the predicted flexibility potential of a building&#8217;s Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system is based on uncertain ambient weather forecasts and a typically inaccurate building thermal model. This paper presents an uncertainty-aware flexibility quantifier using a chance-constrained formulation. Because such a quantifier may be conservative, we additionally model real-time feedback in the quantification, in the form of affine feedback policies. Such adaptation can take the form of intra-day trades or rebound around the flexibility provision period. To assess the flexibility quantification formulations, we further assume that flexible buildings participate in secondary frequency control markets. The results show some increase in flexibility and revenues when introducing affine feedback policies. Additionally, we demonstrate that accounting for uncertainties in the flexibility quantification is necessary, especially when intra-day trades are not available. Even though an uncertainty-ignorant potential may seem financially profitable in secondary frequency control markets, it comes at the cost of significant thermal discomfort for inhabitants. Hence, we suggest a comfort-preserving approach, aiming to truly reflect thermal discomfort on the economic flexibility revenue, to obtain a fairer comparison.</description></item><item><title>Game-Based Optimization Method for Geo-Distributed Data Centers Under Customer Directrix Load Demand Response Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11173940</link><description>This study considers geo-distributed data centers (DCs) with diverse load profiles, electricity prices, and renewable energy availability, aggregated within their respective local virtual power plants (VPPs). To optimize demand response (DR) within such a system, a two-stage decision-making framework is proposed. First, a potential game-based method is developed to decompose the total customer directrix load (CDL) into regional sub-CDLs, aligning with grid requirements while minimizing VPP adjustment costs. Second, an evolutionary game model optimizes workload allocation strategies for DCs across spatial and temporal dimensions, considering constraints of bounded rationality and incomplete information. The proposed models are rigorously analyzed for equilibrium existence, convergence, and stability. A case study based on Google&#8217;s geo-distributed DCs and local grid data demonstrates that the framework effectively enhances VPP revenues and reduces DC operational costs, especially during peak demand periods.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Low-Carbon Scheduling Method for Data Centers Based on Ensemble Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11201935</link><description>The explosive growth of GPU data centers is driven by the surging demand for machine learning, artificial intelligence, and high-performance computing applications, with the pressure on the power grid intensifying. Meanwhile, as renewable energy becomes more integrated into the grid, the carbon intensity of grid electricity varies at different times. This variability presents an opportunity for data centers to align their workloads with periods of high renewable energy generation and low carbon intensity, thereby reducing their operational carbon emissions. This paper proposes a multi-objective scheduling strategy to minimize carbon emissions and maximize quality of service (QoS) by identifying the Pareto front. The proposed strategy employs an integrated reinforcement learning model to dynamically integrate action strategies for multiple objectives. Results from a case study based on a real-world, large-scale data center illustrate the method&#8217;s effectiveness. This effectiveness arises from its dual-objective job scheduling strategy, which simultaneously reduces carbon emissions from electricity consumption and maintains a high quality of service in data centers. The method aims to promote the low-carbon operation of data centers, provide decision support, and facilitate coordination between data centers and power systems in real-world applications.</description></item><item><title>Stability Constrained Voltage Control in Distribution Grids With Arbitrary Communication Infrastructure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11164977</link><description>We consider the problem of designing learning-based reactive power controllers that perform voltage regulation in distribution grids while ensuring closed-loop system stability. In contrast to existing methods, where the provably stable controllers are restricted to be decentralized, we propose a unified design framework that enables the controllers to take advantage of an arbitrary communication infrastructure on top of the physical power network. This allows the controllers to incorporate information beyond their local bus, covering existing methods as a special case and leading to less conservative constraints on the controller design. We then provide a design procedure to construct input convex neural network (ICNN) based controllers that satisfy the identified stability constraints by design under arbitrary communication scenarios, and train these controllers using supervised learning. Simulation results on the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) microgrid testbed illustrate the effectiveness of the framework and highlight the role of communication in improving control performance.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Power Plants for Frequency Regulation: A Learning-Based Method With Safety Guarantee</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11195783</link><description>Frequency safety is becoming increasingly critical in modern power systems due to the reduction of rotational inertia and governor damping. With advances in power electronics, the inverter-based resources (IBRs) installed in distribution networks can provide inertia and frequency support if their controllers are properly designed. In this paper, the virtual power plants (VPPs) framework is leveraged to aggregate and coordinate IBRs to provide inertial and primary-frequency responses. In particular, sufficient conditions are derived for the VPP central controller design to guarantee the transient frequency safety, including stability, the rate of change of frequency and Nadir requirements. On this basis, a nonlinear controller parameterization that satisfies these conditions automatically is proposed. The optimal VPPs control policies are trained by recurrent neural network (RNN)-based reinforcement learning and then fairly disaggregated to individual IBRs, ensuring that IBRs share the power injections for frequency response in proportion to their reserve capacities. Moreover, the controllers are equipped with a safety layer with trivial computation burden to satisfy critical constraint during implementation. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed control strategy outperforms linear controller and other cutting-edge learning-based control strategies.</description></item><item><title>Iterative Linear Programming-Based Angle-Relaxed Branch Flow Model and Its Application to Volt-Var Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11195819</link><description>This paper addresses the challenge of optimizing distribution networks under the increasing integration of distributed energy resources and the inherent nonconvexity of AC power flow equations. Traditional methods relying on conic-relaxed formulations often fail to accurately capture critical voltage and power flow dynamics, particularly when the optimization objective does not directly minimize current magnitudes. To overcome these limitations, we propose an iterative linear formulation for the angle-relaxed branch flow model (BFM-ar), termed BFM-it. This approach iteratively linearizes the branch flow equations and updates key parameters&#8212;such as losses and voltage estimates&#8212;so that each iteration solves a linear program that progressively converges to the true nonlinear AC power flow solution. Both mathematical analysis and numerical experiments confirm that the BFM-it achieves convergence with errors on the order of machine precision, while demonstrating superior performance in volt-var control compared to conventional methods. The proposed method not only enhances modeling accuracy but also offers a computationally efficient framework for real-time distribution network optimization.</description></item><item><title>Power Swing Trajectory Influenced by Virtual Impedance-Based Current-Limiting Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11203273</link><description>Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) can emulate the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through appropriate control loop design. However, in systems with GFM IBRs, the apparent impedance trajectory under current limitation differs significantly from that of SG-based systems due to the limited overcurrent capability of power electronic devices. This difference challenges the power swing detection functions of distance relays designed for SG-based systems. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the apparent impedance trajectory over a full power swing cycle under two typical current-limiting strategies: variable virtual impedance (VI) and adaptive VI. The analysis reveals that the trajectory under VI current-limiting strategies differs significantly from that of a conventional SG. The results also indicate that the control parameters affect the characteristics of the trajectory. In addition, the new trajectories challenge conventional power swing detection functions, increasing the risk of malfunction. Furthermore, the implementation of VI leads to a deterioration in system stability. The theoretical analysis is further validated through simulations on the MATLAB/Simulink platform.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Distributionally Robust Optimization Dispatch for Power Systems With Uncertain Small-Sample Wind and Photovoltaic Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11203248</link><description>Extreme meteorological phenomena (e.g., cold waves) are low-probability, high-impact events that present significant operational and dispatch challenges for new-energy power systems. 1) Insufficient data on wind and photovoltaic power generation hinder data-driven modelling. 2) The uncertainty of small-sample wind and photovoltaic data is difficult to characterize. Therefore, a two-stage distributionally robust optimization dispatch strategy for a power system based on small-sample wind and solar data with uncertainty is developed. First, a generalized modelling method for a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) is proposed, which increases the generation of hourly output data for wind and photovoltaic power. Considering the drawback of large prediction errors for wind power and photovoltaic power in small-sample cases, a two-stage distributionally robust optimization model based on the Wasserstein metric is constructed, which embeds hard constraints (e.g., the capacity constraint of wind and solar transmission lines) and soft constraints (e.g., prediction errors). This model is nonconvex, and exactly solving it incurs a heavy computational burden. Duality theory and relaxation approximation are adopted here; the robust two-stage-distribution model is transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming model, and the iterative Taylor formula algorithm is used to linearize the constraint conditions. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate that the proposed model and solution algorithm can not only address the uncertainty of small-sample wind and photovoltaic data but also reduce the system operating costs and increase the model-solving efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Stage Optimization Method for Real-Time Parameterization of PV-Farm Digital Twins</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11235949</link><description>Digital twins (DTs) are high-fidelity virtual models of physical systems. This paper details a novel two-stage optimization method for real-time parameterization of photovoltaic digital twins (PVDTs) using field measurements. Initially, the method estimates equivalent irradiance from PV power, voltage, and current data, eliminating the need for direct irradiance sensors. This is crucial for tuning the DT&#8217;s parameters to actual environmental conditions, thereby improving power prediction accuracy. The second stage focuses on refining these parameters by minimizing discrepancies between measured and predicted outputs. This optimization utilizes the estimated equivalent irradiance as a model input, maintaining synchronization with real-world conditions. Parameter updates are event-trigger, launched when deviations exceed predefined thresholds. This strategy optimizes prediction accuracy and manages communication loads efficiently. Validated with extensive data from a PV farm, this approach outperforms existing methodologies in predictive accuracy and operational efficiency, significantly improving the performance DTs in real-time grid operations.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Distribution of Grid-Following and Grid-Forming Converters for Charging Control of Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11181195</link><description>We address the problem of determining the optimal combination of grid-following (GFL) versus grid-forming (GFM) modes of control in electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) to maintain an acceptable balance between small-signal stability and voltage stability of electric distribution grids. We recall the state-space dynamic models of EVCSs operating in GFL and GFM modes and demonstrate how high charging rates of electric vehicles (EVs) in the GFL mode can impact small-signal performance. We then optimize the GFL-to-GFM ratio while also determining the optimal EV charging setpoints and a state-feedback controller to minimize the  $\mathcal {H}_{2}$ -norm of the grid transfer function (TF). To make the proposed optimization computationally favorable, we use participation factor analysis to identify the most dominant EVCSs in the GFM mode so that they can be prioritized for optimization. We validate our results using a modified model of the IEEE 33-bus power distribution test system with ten EVCSs.</description></item><item><title>Planning and Integration of a Multi-Robot Adaptive Charging Network for Voltage Regulation via Unscented Kalman Filter-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11195829</link><description>High levels of electric vehicle (EV) penetration and load uncertainty pose significant challenges to traditional voltage regulation in distribution systems (DS), particularly concerning voltage drops. This study investigates the potential of a dual-service mode (V2V/V2G) for mobile charging using multiple charging robots, cooperating with conventional DS voltage regulation methods to enhance performance. Specifically, we propose a multi-robot adaptive charging network (MRACN) embedded in a three-level voltage regulation framework to address voltage violations. At the low level, we introduce a voltage security rule-based dispatch strategy for MRACN to mitigate EV-induced voltage drops. At the mid-level, we optimize day-ahead scheduling of on-load tap changers and capacitor banks via optimal power flow for long-term voltage regulation. At the high level, we employ an unscented Kalman filter-based deep reinforcement learning (UKF-DRL) approach to integrate MRACN into DSs for real-time voltage control. Experimental results demonstrate that MRACN effectively reduces voltage violations and enhances the flexibility of conventional voltage control systems. Moreover, the UKF-DRL method accelerates DRL training by nearly an order of magnitude compared to full AC power-flow solutions, with the overwhelming majority of state estimates deviating by no more than 2%.</description></item><item><title>A Resilience-Oriented Incentive Pricing Strategy for Power-Transportation Network Against Flood Hazards</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11197582</link><description>Extreme weather events, such as flood hazards, may superimpose damage on coupled power-transportation networks (PTNs). An effective approach is to guide electric vehicle (EV) owners to enhance grid resilience. However, the EV emergency response and incentive prices are not sufficiently quantified for the post-flood recovery of power distribution network (PDN). Thus, this paper develops a fault scenario generation method to capture the capacity attacks on coupled PTNs during flood hazards. Then, a resilience-oriented tri-level incentive pricing strategy of EV emergency response is proposed for PDN post-flood recovery. At the upper level, EV charging station (EVCS) operators decide incentive pricing strategies for EV emergency response services by assessing the coupled relations of EV discharging/path strategies and PDN subsidy. At the middle level, a modified traffic model is proposed to capture the EV owner&#8217;s inconvenience cost associated with emergency response. At the lower level, a resilience metric incorporating EV discharging responses is introduced to mitigate load curtailment of PDN. Furthermore, a decomposition method based on column generation and optimal path set pre-assignment is proposed to address the urgency and destination uncertainty in emergency responses. Numerical results illuminate that the proposed strategy could reduce 41% of the peak load power shedding.</description></item><item><title>Intrusion Detection System for Digital Substations Using Semi-Supervised Learning and Traffic Distance Similarity Clustering</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168910</link><description>Cyber attacks on power grids are imminent and potentially have a severe impact, as evidenced by the cyber attacks in Ukraine in 2015, 2016, and 2022. In response to this challenge, machine learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have become more prevalent as a potential mitigation owing to their alignment with the latest advances in artificial intelligence. However, existing anomaly detection methods for power grid Operational Technology (OT) are often inadequate, as they primarily focus on detecting power grid physical anomalies at the later attack stages and suffer from the scarcity of available data for supervised machine learning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised IDS specifically for digital substations of the power system. The proposed detection method identifies the distinctive distance similarity of digital substation OT communication traffic using a Convolutional Neural Network and Chebyshev distance of packet payloads, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov of packets&#8217; interarrival time using Fast Fourier Transform amplitude. Subsequently, these traffic features are combined into a vector and classified using a novel hybrid semi-supervised Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). Results indicate that the proposed method can identify zero-day attacks and achieve accuracy and F1 above 95%.</description></item><item><title>A Dual Power Grid Cascading Failure Model for the Vulnerability Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11175257</link><description>When considering attacks against the power grid, one of the most effective approaches could be the attack to the transmission lines that leads to large cascading failures. Hence, the problem of locating the most critical or vulnerable transmission lines for a Power Grid Cascading Failure (PGCF) has drawn much attention from the research society. There exist many deterministic solutions and stochastic approximation algorithms aiming to analyze the power grid vulnerability. However, it has been challenging to reveal the correlations between the transmission lines for the critical line identification. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that learns such correlations, based on self-supervised learning and the self-attention mechanism, which is inspired by the Transformer model for natural language processing (NLP). Once the correlations are learned, a ranking algorithm is introduced for the critical line identification. With extensive experiments comparing our approach versus 2 other benchmark algorithms, it is proven that the proposed Dual PGCF model provides a novel and effective solution for critical line identification.</description></item><item><title>Scalable Voltage Control for DC Microgrids: Robustness to Network Structural Variations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11180064</link><description>Frequent plug-in/-out operations result in structural variations of DC microgrids (DCmGs), posing challenges to scalable control and often requiring costly redesigns to maintain stability. To address this issue, this paper proposes a scalable voltage control strategy for uncertain DCmGs, enabling plug-and-play functionality without controller redesign or system reconfiguration. A polytopic uncertain DCmG model is first formulated to simultaneously capture parameter uncertainties in distributed generation units (DGUs), power lines, and ZIP (i.e., impedance, current, and power) loads. A structured free-weight matrix technique is then developed to mitigate the adverse effects of line and load uncertainties on DGUs while yielding a more tractable linear matrix inequality formulation. The proposed scalable control method is implemented locally to ensure the dissipative voltage stability of each DGU, thereby preserving the dissipativity of the entire network. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in achieving faster convergence and reduced overshoot.</description></item><item><title>An SDN-Based Framework for Cyber-Physically Coordinated Voltage Support of Virtual Power Plants Against DoS Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11181222</link><description>The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into smart grids is accelerating worldwide. However, the growing reliance on information and communication technologies (ICTs) for real-time monitoring and control in large-scale DER aggregations introduces significant cybersecurity risks. Among these, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks pose a critical threat, with the potential to severely disrupt system operations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a security-by-design framework for large-scale DER aggregation in the context of virtual power plants (VPPs), with a focus on enhancing the resilience of voltage support services. Central to this framework is a cyber-physical coordinated control architecture that leverages software-defined networking (SDN) to dynamically adapt to variations in both the cyber and physical layers. Specifically, a cyber-aware voltage control algorithm is developed to coordinate DERs based on the real-time status of the communication network, while a physically informed network configuration algorithm adjusts communication paths according to voltage support priorities. The proposed approach is evaluated through cyber&#8211;physical co-simulations on both the IEEE 123-bus test system and the 240-bus test system, based on a real-world distribution system located in the Midwest U.S., under server DoS attack scenarios. Results demonstrate that the SDN-enabled coordination significantly mitigates server DoS attacks, confirming the framework&#8217;s effectiveness and robustness.

Previous research has overlooked the influences of hot standby emergency resources and actual services in post-disaster restoration. Taking into account thermal inertia (TI) and wireless communication emergency resources, this paper proposes a post-disaster multi-timescale coordinated restoration method for PTCPS, aiming to minimize load loss, reduce emergency costs, decrease communication delays, and maximize distributed generation (DG) absorption. Firstly, models for TI, wireless communication, and repair crew emergency resources are established, and the multi-timescale coordination emergency resources are formed. Secondly, based on the switch control and load control services, a cyber-physical interaction model is constructed, and a dynamic networking model for wireless communication with wired communication node access is established. Then, the communication network, physical system operations, and topology reconfiguration models are constructed. To optimize the numerous unconventional nonlinear constraints in the proposed model, the logical constraint and Big-M methods are introduced in linearization techniques, the multiple linearization methods are derived. Finally, case studies are conducted using an improved RBTS-Bus2 power system/12-node thermal system, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method through comparisons with two benchmarks and highlighting the necessity of multi-timescale emergency resources and cyber-physical interaction.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic PMU Configuration for Stealthy Multi-Snapshot FDIA Mitigation: Enhancing Security in Hybrid-Measurement-Based State Estimation in Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11184615</link><description>Modern power systems have evolved into cyber-physical power systems (CPPSs) requiring high-resolution spatial-temporal state awareness, driving the adoption of hybrid measurement-based state estimation (SE). However, such advancements introduce heightened cybersecurity requirements that demand systematic investigations from adversarial perspectives. This paper establishes a comprehensive attacker-defender framework with dual contributions. From the attacker&#8217;s perspective, this paper proposes a multi-snapshot coordinated false data injection attack (MS-FDIA) strategy against hybrid measurement-based SE. The proposed attack model can effectively bypass both hybrid measurement synchronization checks and temporal data anomaly detection mechanisms, thereby achieving enhanced stealth and operational impact. From the defender&#8217;s perspective, this paper develops a dynamic trusted phasor measurement unit (PMU) configuration scheme that adaptively reconfigures secure measurement matrix subsets against evolving multistage attacks. The defense mechanism is solved through two complementary approaches: a numerical algorithm based on matrix row transformations and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based optimization method with temporal awareness. Comprehensive case studies on different standard test systems demonstrate the improved MS-FDIA mitigation capabilities and the defense scheme&#8217;s effectiveness, and the test results reveal the matrix transformation algorithm&#8217;s superiority in small-scale systems versus DRL&#8217;s scalability advantages for large networks.</description></item><item><title>Communication-Aware Wide-Area Damping Control Using Risk-Constrained Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11222886</link><description>Non-ideal communication links, especially delays, critically affect fast networked controls in power systems, such as the wide-area damping control (WADC). Traditionally, a delay estimation and compensation approach is adopted to address this cyber-physical coupling, but it demands very high accuracy for the fast WADC and cannot handle other cyber concerns like link failures or cyber perturbations. Hence, we propose a new risk-constrained framework that can target the communication delays, yet amenable to general uncertainty under the cyber-physical couplings. Our WADC model includes the synchronous generators (SGs), and also voltage source converters (VSCs) for additional damping capabilities. To mitigate uncertainty, a mean-variance risk constraint is introduced to the classical optimal control cost of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Unlike estimating delays, our approach can effectively mitigate large communication delays by improving the worst-case performance. A reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm, namely, stochastic gradient-descent with max-oracle (SGDmax), is developed to solve the risk-constrained problem. We further show its guaranteed convergence to stationarity at a high probability, even using the simple zero-order policy gradient (ZOPG). Numerical tests on the IEEE 68-bus system not only verify SGDmax&#8217;s convergence and VSCs&#8217; damping capabilities, but also demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional delay compensator-based methods under estimation error. While focusing on performance improvement under large delays, our proposed risk-constrained design can effectively mitigate the worst-case oscillations, making it equally effective for addressing other communication issues and cyber perturbations.</description></item><item><title>Load Forecasting Model Trading: A Cost-Oriented and Auction-Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11181218</link><description>Data sharing is essential for accurate load forecasting and efficient energy management, yet data exchange remains severely constrained by a lack of effective economic incentives. Data markets have emerged as a potential solution by incentivizing the exchange of data and forecasting resources among stakeholders. Existing data market mechanisms, often designed around trading raw data or forecast outputs, face multiple barriers&#8212;such as privacy concerns, valuation misaligned with real operational benefits, unilateral pricing, computationally intensive allocation, and inflexible asset adaptation&#8212;that limit their practicality for real-world energy applications. The aim of this paper is to address these challenges by proposing a novel market framework that treats pre-trained forecasting models as tradable assets, thereby fundamentally redefining the data market paradigm. Specifically, a cost-oriented evaluation approach that links model quality to downstream operational costs is first established as the foundation throughout the entire market process. Subsequently, we propose a bilateral iterative model auction mechanism to enable efficient transactions between the buyer and sellers while maximizing social welfare. Furthermore, we propose a model adaptation strategy, including model fine-tuning and ensembling, for the buyer to enhance the applicability of purchased models to his decision-making problem. Case studies in building energy management based on public datasets demonstrate that our approach converges to the socially optimal solution, allowing all participants to benefit: sellers are appropriately compensated for providing high-quality models, and buyers achieve significant operational cost reductions through the utilization of traded models.</description></item><item><title>Forced Oscillation Recognition With Interpretable Network Framework for Class Imbalance and Limited Real-World Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11200994</link><description>Deep learning (DL) holds significant potential for distinguishing forced oscillations (FOs) from natural oscillations (NOs) and resonances in power systems. However, most existing studies treat DL models as opaque system classifiers, and these models are often susceptible to challenges such as class imbalance among the three oscillation patterns (i.e., FOs, NOs, and resonances) and the limited size of real-world training datasets. These issues can lead to incorrect diagnoses of oscillation patterns in practical applications. To address these challenges, we propose a FO oscillation recognition framework that integrates balanced data processing, an interpretable recognition network, and a fine-tuning learning strategy. In this framework, DeepSMOTE1D is introduced to address the issue of class imbalance by oversampling features extracted from an encoder-decoder network. The interpretable DWT-CNN-LSTM recognition network incorporates multiple discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) into each convolutional and LSTM layer to enhance both interpretability and performance of the model. Finally, a fine-tuning transfer learning strategy is employed, where the recognition network is first pretrained on simulation data and subsequently retrained on limited real-world data. The effectiveness of DeepSMOTE1D and the fine-tuning strategy in the proposed framework is also evaluated. Experimental results show that the proposed recognition model not only learns effectively from simulated oscillation data but also outperforms existing related networks in real-world scenarios, achieving superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.</description></item><item><title>OptDisPro: LLM-Based Multi-Agent Framework for Flexibly Adapting Heuristic Optimal DisFlow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11201936</link><description>The existing generative coding of distribution grids modeling and optimization face several issues, like complicated usage or high auto-codes error rates. This paper proposes the OptDisPro, a novel LLM-based multi-agent framework, enabling automatic optimal power flow (OPF) script modeling and solving. Driven by interactive linguistic instruction, it realizes automatic coding for customized requirements and flexibly adaptive heuristic optimization. Specifically, domain expertise and example scripts are encoded into structured prompt sequences to guide OptDisPro and enhance reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (COT). To mitigate LLM hallucinations, a contextual feedback mechanism is introduced, which collects error messages from the run-time environment for self-correction. Furthermore, Adaptive Selection of Multiple Algorithms (ASMA) is applied in the solving process, flexibly selecting heuristic algorithms to decrease the possibility of local optima. According to cases verification in multiple scenarios, the simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of OptDisPro in OPF problem of distribution network. The results also encourage further exploration of LLM applications in script online self-updating, autonomous OPF problem-solving and intelligent operation within distribution grid.</description></item><item><title>Learning Data-Driven Uncertainty Set Partitions for Robust and Adaptive Energy Forecasting With Missing Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11202569</link><description>Short-term forecasting models typically assume the availability of input data (features) when they are deployed and in use. However, equipment failures, disruptions, cyberattacks, may lead to missing features when such models are used operationally, which could negatively affect forecast accuracy, and result in suboptimal operational decisions. In this paper, we use adaptive robust optimization and adversarial machine learning to develop forecasting models that seamlessly handle missing data operationally. We propose linear- and neural network-based forecasting models with parameters that adapt to available features, combining linear adaptation with a novel algorithm for learning data-driven uncertainty set partitions. The proposed adaptive models do not rely on identifying historical missing data patterns and are suitable for real-time operations under stringent time constraints. Extensive numerical experiments on short-term wind power forecasting considering horizons from 15 minutes to 4 hours ahead illustrate that our proposed adaptive models are on par with imputation when data are missing for very short periods (e.g., when only the latest measurement is missing) whereas they significantly outperform imputation when data are missing for longer periods. We further provide insights by showcasing how linear adaptation and data-driven partitions (even with a few subsets) approach the performance of the optimal, yet impractical, method of retraining for every possible realization of missing data.</description></item><item><title>Frequency-Aware Multi-Task Forecasting for Integrated Energy Systems via Variational Mode Decomposition and Convolution-Attention Encoding</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11205895</link><description>Integrated Energy Systems (IESs) integrate electricity, heating, cooling, and gas through coupled infrastructures, posing forecasting challenges due to heterogeneous temporal patterns and cross-energy interference. These heterogeneous temporal patterns often reflect distinct frequency characteristics, which existing multi-task approaches struggle to disentangle due to the lack of frequency-aware task decoupling. To address this, this paper proposes VATLNet, a unified multi-task forecasting framework that integrates frequency-aware task decoupling with hybrid convolution-attention feature extraction. Specifically, multivariate energy inputs are decomposed via variational mode decomposition, and the resulting components are clustered into frequency-similar groups based on sample entropy. A shared encoder combining temporal convolutional networks and multi-head attention extracts frequency features across all clusters, which are then independently decoded by parallel long short-term memory network branches. Extensive experiments on real-world IES load datasets demonstrate that VATLNet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 2.44% and 1.03% MAPE in single- and multi-task forecasting, respectively. The framework improves cross-frequency-aware feature extraction, reduces inter-task interference, and enhances forecasting robustness and interpretability across diverse energy modalities.</description></item><item><title>Smart Meter Scheduling for Data-Driven Granular Customer Voltage Visibility</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11215656</link><description>The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in power distribution systems introduces greater voltage volatility. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) measurements at medium-voltage (MV) networks cannot directly monitor customer-end voltages; smart meters provide direct customer-end voltages but have insufficient reporting rates to track short-term voltage fluctuations due to DERs. This paper proposes an approach to high-resolution voltage monitoring at all customer points based on low-resolution smart meter measurements. This is based on staggered smart meter data acquisition: smart meters are grouped into subsets, each of which contains enough information to estimate the voltages of all customers. These subsets of smart meters are scheduled to report their data at different times rather than simultaneously. Then, at each instant when a subset of meters reports their measurements, a data-driven method is used to estimate all the unreported customer voltages by utilizing voltage measurements of the reporting subset. To support multi-customer estimation with minimal computational overhead, an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model is chosen due to its efficiency and robustness. This approach ensures high-resolution voltage estimation (HiVE) without the need of increasing the reporting rate of smart meters. Extensive simulations on real-world smart meter datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Aperiodic Sampling Load Frequency Control of Wind Power-Integrated Power Systems With Packet Losses and Delays Under Discrete Time Feedback Interconnection Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11181202</link><description>This paper explores the stability assessment and the development of controllers for aperiodic sampling load frequency control scheme for wind power-integrated power systems, accounting for communication delays and packet losses. Firstly, transform the multi-area continuous time model into a discrete time load frequency control model. By incorporating linear operators to manage the uncertainties including communication delays, packet losses and sampling interval within the system, the discrete time load frequency control system is converted into a feedback interconnected system that consists of uncertain operators and linear time-invariant systems. Secondly, the exponential stability condition of the system is given by utilizing the integral quadratic constraint theory and linear matrix inequality technique, which can be used to compute the upper bounds for aperiodic sampled-data intervals and delays. Furthermore, based on the proposed stability conditions, a controller iteration optimization algorithm is designed, which effectively addresses issues related to delays and packet losses. Finally, an example study based on one-area, three-area load frequency control system and IEEE 39-bus system show that the method can obtain larger sampling upper bounds and better control performance than previous methods.</description></item><item><title>A Cross-Level Consistency-Aware Diffusion Model of Hierarchical Imputation for Energy Prosumers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168916</link><description>Motivated by the aggregation structure of prosumers from energy communities within a region, this letter proposes a cross-level consistency-aware diffusion model for solving the hierarchical imputation problem (CDHI), directly processing three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical time series. In CDHI, a 3D attention mechanism of hierarchical, temporal, and feature Transformer layers is developed to capture the aggregated dependency of hierarchical series. Based on mask modeling, we extend imputation target choice strategies of missing patterns, thus training CDHI in a self-supervised manner. For implementation, we formulate the aggregation structure of prosumers as the hierarchical consistency across aggregation levels in the denoising loss function of CDHI.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Constrained Multidimensional Optimization for UAV-Aided Secure Data Collection With Cooperative Jamming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11080077</link><description>Due to the agile mobility and line-of-sight transmission capabilities, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a promising technology for facilitating data collection from sensor nodes (SNs) in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, the inherent security vulnerabilities of ground-to-air channels and the energy limitation issues of UAVs and wireless devices pose significant challenges to UAV-assisted data collection. Thus, this paper develops a secure and effective UAV-aided data collection scheme. In this scheme, each SN operates in either sleep or wake-up mode to conserve energy, and a UAV collects data from wake-up SNs in an eavesdropped environment. To prevent interception by an eavesdropper, other idle IoT devices are strategically chosen to act as friendly jammers to send artificial noise cooperatively. We aim to maximize the worst-case secrecy rate of the considered system by jointly optimizing UAV trajectory design, sensor scheduling, and jammer selection besides ensuring all the data from SNs are successfully collected by the UAV under the triple energy constraints of the UAV, SNs, and jammers and a maximum speed constraint for the UAV. Since the formulated problem is a challenging mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm to tackle this problem by exploiting block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA). Finally, simulation results validate the superior performance of our proposed scheme compared to several baseline schemes in terms of secrecy rate.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Event-Triggered Multi-Objective Fault Detection for Turbofan Engine Sensors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082013</link><description>Turbofan engine is the important power source of large uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), whose health status plays a vital role in the flight operation. This paper mainly focus on the adaptive event-triggered multi-objective fault detection scheme for turbofan engine sensors. Firstly, the adaptive event-triggered mechanism (AETM) is adopted to achieve the balance between saving communication resources and guaranteeing the system performance. Based on the AETM, an optimal multi-objective $ l_{1}/H_\infty$ fault detection scheme is designed for continuous time system with transmission delay such that the generated residual is both robust against exogenous disturbance and sensitive to the sensor bias fault. Ultimately, an example of turbofan engine Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test is conducted to evaluate our proposed scheme, which is reflective of its engineering value.</description></item><item><title>Joint User Association and Beamforming for Dynamic Metasurface Antenna Based Cell-Free mmWave MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11075604</link><description>Cell-free millimeter wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems have shown great potential for satisfying demands of extra-large capacity, ultra-massive connectivity and ultra-high reliability in future wireless networks, which however may suffer from significant energy consumption and hardware cost due to large-scale distributed antenna arrays operating at mmWave bands. To alleviate this issue, a novel dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) array has been considered as an energy-efficient and cost-efficient alternative to the conventional fully-digital array deployed at each access point (AP). In this paper, we aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) in a DMA-based cell-free mmWave MIMO system by jointly optimizing user association, transmit beamformer, fronthaul compression and DMA weighting matrix, where both the limited fronthaul capacity and the near-field propagation effect are considered. To tackle this non-convex mixed-integer problem effectively, we propose a double-loop penalty dual decomposition (PDD) based algorithm with the aid of variable substitution and successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. In order to circumvent its high iteration complexity, we also develop a low-complexity alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm to find a high-quality suboptimal solution with a single-loop structure. Moreover, the extensions of our work to the partially-decentralized distributed implementation and the non-coherent transmission at distributed APs are discussed. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms achieve superior performance over various benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>HADML: Hierarchical Asynchronous Deep Mutual Learning in Edge Intelligence Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11087760</link><description>Deep mutual learning (DML) stands out as a prominent technology in the rapidly evolving landscape of model compression over the past few years.

Hierarchical and asynchronous model aggregation methods can also fully leverage the advantages of device-to-device (D2D) based wireless networks. To improve the learning efficiency of HADML, we further formulate a non-convex optimization problem, aiming to minimize the average energy consumption for knowledge exchange by adjusting link scheduling and communication resource allocation. To solve this problem effectively, it is decomposed into two subproblems, and a joint graph neural network and deep unfolding network algorithm is developed to obtain the solutions. Finally, the proposed algorithm's performance is validated through simulation results, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving efficient and secure HADML in distributed system architecture.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Resource Allocation for IoT With Computing Power Network Based on RIS-UAV-Aided NOMA-THz Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079790</link><description>The integration of advanced technologies such as sixth-generation mobile communications (6G), artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain has given new impetus to the development of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, these applications require higher computational power and lower latency, which present challenges to traditional network architectures. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel computing power network (CPN) architecture based on reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-Terahertz (THz) communication, and it aims to meet high computational demands. In the proposed scheme, CPN is introduced to assist IoT devices in executing tasks, thereby enhancing data processing. Concretely, THz communications and NOMA technologies are utilized to increase data rates and spectral efficiency. The combination of RIS and UAV shows promise in overcoming the challenges of high path loss and high sensitivity to blockage in THz communication, thereby improving system performance. To increase the efficiency of the proposed architecture, it is crucial to rationally allocate computational and transmission resources. Therefore, a joint optimization problem is formulated to minimize system consumption, encompassing both time and energy usage. To achieve efficient resource allocation, an adaptive N-Step method based on soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm is employed. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the existing baselines.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Carrier Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling for OTFS Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11078288</link><description>Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation technique is promising for high-mobility applications to achieve reliable communications. However, the capacity of OTFS systems is generally limited by the Nyquist criterion, requiring orthogonal pulses in both time and frequency domains. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-carrier faster-than-Nyquist (MC-FTN) signaling scheme for OTFS systems. By adopting non-orthogonal pulses in both time and frequency domains, our scheme significantly improves the capacity of OTFS systems. Specifically, we firstly develop the signal models for both single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OTFS systems. Then, we optimize the delay-Doppler (DD) domain precoding matrix at the transmitter to suppress both the inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) introduced by the MC-FTN signaling. For SISO systems, we develop an eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) precoding scheme with optimal power allocation (PA) for achieving the maximum capacity. For MIMO systems, we develop a successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based precoding scheme via decomposing the capacity maximization problem into multiple sub-capacity maximization problems with largely reduced dimensions of optimization variables. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed MC-FTN-OTFS signaling scheme achieves significantly higher capacity than traditional Nyquist-criterion-based OTFS systems. Moreover, the SIC-based precoding scheme can effectively reduce the complexity of MIMO capacity maximization, while attaining performance close to the optimal EVD-based precoding scheme.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Driven Learning for RIS-Assisted Multi-User MISO Beamforming and Reflection With Uplink Channel Information</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079883</link><description>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can improve wireless transmission performance by passive reflective elements to reconfigure the wireless propagation environment.

This paper focuses on the sum rate maximization problem with the transmit power constraint and the phase constraint, for the RIS-assisted multiuser multiple-input-single-output (MISO) downlink transmission where the downlink and uplink channel reciprocity does not exist. To solve this problem, we propose a data and model-driven learning approach via a hybrid learning manner. Specifically, we adopt an optimal beamforming structure to effectively reduce the output dimension and to improve the training and testing efficiency of the neural network. Then, we provide a learning framework including several fully-connected neural networks to learn the mapping between uplink and downlink channels, power features of the beamforming, and phase-shift matrices, after which the optimal beamforming can be recovered by the proposed beamforming structure. Simulation results show that our proposed method achieves better rate performance than state-of-the-art data-driven learning approaches.</description></item><item><title>Beamforming Design for RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems Under Finite Channel Blocklength Transmissions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11080336</link><description>Thanks to low path-loss and high macro-diversity gain, the cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is regarded as a perspective technique to realize ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) for future wireless systems. In this paper, we consider the emerging reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to further improve the capability of CF massive MIMO system in URLLC provision. Under the finite channel blocklength regime, we formulate the sum spectral efficiency (SE) maximization problem to jointly design the active beamforming of access points (APs) and the passive beamforming of RISs. To resolve this non-convex problem, we establish a tight logarithmically lower bound based on the majorization minimization criterion to replace the complicated objective function. Then, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to solve two subproblems and derive the closed-form solutions of both active and passive beamformings. Taking into account the extra power consumption of RISs, we utilize the novel performance metric named resource efficiency (RE) to investigate the trade-off between SE and energy efficiency (EE) in RIS-aided CF massive MIMO URLLC systems. Moreover, a variant bisection search algorithm is developed to maximize the system RE. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed lower bound for optimizing the RIS-aided CF massive MIMO URLLC system. The proposed algorithms are also effective in improving the sum-SE and striking the SE-EE balance of RIS-aided CF massive MIMO URLLC systems.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Type Disaster Scenario Task Offloading in Air&#8211;Ground Integrated Search and Rescue Networks: A Blockchain-Assisted MFL Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11074756</link><description>Inrecent years, autonomous aerial vehicle (UAV) has demonstrated significant potential in Search and Rescue (SAR) operations by providing real-time high-definition image and video data.

To begin with, an optimization problem for the average content downloading delay minimization is formulated, by jointly optimizing the caching placement, trajectory, and transmit power of the drone, while satisfying the cache capacity, total transmit power, and kinematics constraints of the drones. However, there is an unpredictable nature in the environment, such as changes in content requests, locations of the users and drones, making it difficult to be solved by traditional optimization methods. In order to address this difficulty, the formulated problem is firstly modeled as a Markov decision process, and then a deep reinforcement learning framework based on dual-clip proximity policy optimization (DC-PPO) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. The algorithm adaptively searches for caching placement, trajectory, and transmit power of drone, and a better match between action and state is ensured by using a soft greed strategy to make decisions. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed DC-PPO algorithm outperforms the benchmark algorithms in terms of the average content downloading delay and the convergence speed.

This study evaluates three advanced nonisolated dc&#8211;dc converter topologies: interleaved boost, quadratic boost, and multi-input/single-output (MISO) under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control using the perturb and observe algorithm. Simulations were conducted in Simulink using real irradiance and temperature data collected in a high solar irradiance place, such as Antofagasta, Chile. The system comprises 600 photovoltaic cells ($350\, \mathrm{V}$) connected to a $540\,\mathrm{ V}$ dc-Link bus and a $50\, \text{kWh}$ LiFePO$_{4}$ battery bank. Key performance metrics, such as voltage gain, efficiency, current ripple, and duty cycle behavior, were analyzed under three solar scenarios. Under favorable irradiance, all topologies delivered over $3.2\, \text{kW}$ with ideal efficiencies above 98.4%. The interleaved topology demonstrated strong steady-state performance but limited transient regulation. The quadratic converter operated with a low duty cycle yet showed greater sensitivity to disturbances. In contrast, the MISO converter consistently maintained a stable output, low ripple, and high efficiency even under minimal irradiance conditions (70 W/m$^{2}$). These results position the MISO topology as the most robust solution for variable urban environments, ensuring reliable energy delivery and supporting the efficient deployment of ViPV systems in electric mobility applications.</description></item><item><title>Tracking Concepts for High-Density PV Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11205357</link><description>In the search for new sites, photovoltaic (PV) system installations spread out into complex places and contexts, such as hilly terrain, floating PV, and agriPV. It is, therefore, plausible to assume that PV power plants will increasingly need to use space and, thus, sunlight more efficiently, e.g., by not wasting solar energy in the space between module rows. This means it may become increasingly important to consider the energy output of PV systems per area of land use, i.e., the &#8220;efficiency of the PV system.&#8221; To increase this efficiency, power plants with high density of PV modules are needed. For tracked systems, this necessitates adapting the tracking strategies to avoid excessive losses from either row-to-row shading or angle-of-incidence losses in backtracking. This article explores different tracking strategies that could contribute to enabling high-density PV power plants with high efficiency. The advantages of these advanced tracking strategies are quantified at two different latitudes as a function of the ground coverage ratio.</description></item><item><title>Floating Offshore Solar Photovoltaics for Land-Constrained and Diverse Renewable Supply Conditions in the United States and Canada</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11214224</link><description>Energy transition pathways for large continental areas are largely understood to be achievable using a diverse set of onshore renewable energy technologies. Previous research for the integrated United States and Canada energy&#8211;industry system indicated that solar photovoltaics (PVs) may dominate the primary energy structure, complemented by onshore wind power. However, societal constraints may require increased supply diversity, and onshore renewable energy may not be sufficient for densely populated regions, especially on the east coast of the United States. The LUT Energy System Transition Model was applied to investigate the role of floating offshore solar PV coupled with offshore wind and wave power when onshore solar PV is limited. The results indicate that, when onshore solar PV is limited to 60% of electricity generation, 434 GW of floating offshore solar PV may be installed by 2050 as part of a hybrid power plant sharing the same grid connection as offshore wind power, which reaches 414 GW of installed capacity, contributing 607 and 1576 TWh to the electricity supply, respectively. In total, 7.4 TW of solar PV capacity is installed by 2050, complemented by 1.4 TW of onshore wind power. Increased supply diversity still leads to a 42% reduction in the levelized cost of electricity, reaching 32.7 &#8364;/MWh in 2050. Compared with cost-optimal conditions, the levelized cost of final energy and nonenergy use in 2050 increases by 28% to 52.7 &#8364;/MWh. Nevertheless, such increased costs may be justifiable to meet societal constraints, and a diverse power-to-X economy structure for the United States and Canada may still be technoeconomically viable.</description></item><item><title>Performance Limits in Bifacial Tandem Solar Cell Modules for Multiple Configurations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224657</link><description>While bifacial tandem photovoltaic technology is promising as it is able to generate higher electrical power output by accessing illumination from both front and rear surfaces, a thorough investigation of the performance limits of bifacial tandems with different architectures/arrangements and under different conditions has not been explored. In this work, we present a comprehensive analytical framework based on the principle of detailed balance to assess the performance limits of bifacial tandems spanning multiple architectures, including unconstrained, current-matched (CM), and voltage-matched (VM) configurations. Our methodology explores the performance benefits of incorporating area-decoupled subcells across layers and examines the impact of different bandgap arrangements (monotonic and non-monotonic) on the performance. We show that having non-monotonic arrangement of bandgaps under optimal albedo conditions can significantly enhance the performance of bifacial tandems. In addition, we analyze the performance resilience of each configuration and bandgap arrangement to spectral variations induced by environmental factors such as shading, fluctuations in temperature, and albedo. This provides crucial design guidelines for the design, fabrication, and estimation of the performance limits of these solar cell architectures in different conditions.</description></item><item><title>Performance Enhancement of Bifacial PV Modules on Horizontal Single-Axis Trackers in Desert Environments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11206410</link><description>The adoption of bifacial photovoltaic (PV) modules has grown significantly due to their potential for higher energy yield.

Reliably managing high penetrations of solar PV within modern grids requires predictions that reflect the systemic consequences of fast renewable variability across cyber-physical energy infrastructure. This article proposes RR-LTNet, a ramp-rate (RR)-centric prediction architecture that elevates the RR as the core variability feature linking plant-level intermittency to grid-level operational risk. RR-LTNet first performs dynamic clustering of RR regimes to characterize rapid weather transitions and stability conditions. These regimes taken as feature for hybrid temporal learner that fuses recurrent memory with temporal convolution to capture multiscale dynamics. For predictive assessment, numerical experiments are conducted on one year solar power database of the Yulara Solar Project, Australia. The proposed RR-LTNet consistently outperforms other feature extraction methods by achieving up to 90% reductions in root mean square error (RMSE) for 5-min resolution. The reductions are significantly larger when baseline models are augmented with RR-aware features than when those features are absent. Cross-site validation on two additional PV plants with different capacity and data distribution confirms robustness and consistency required for system engineering deployment across fleets. By surfacing variability intelligence in real time, RR-LTNet supports PV-specific tasks central to reserve scheduling, advanced simulation of PV plant-grid interactions. This framework thus bridges PV monitoring analytics with system level reliability engineering, accelerating the integration of large-scale PV into modern power systems.</description></item><item><title>A Compact and Efficient 40 V Capacitive Level Shifter With Feedback Discharge Control for Enhanced CMTI and Low FoM for Bootstrapped Gate Drivers in BCD Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106922</link><description>A high-speed, low-figure-of-merit capacitive floating level shifter (CF-LS) for high-side bootstrapped gate drivers is presented.

Compared to recent works, the design offers a  $2\times $  improvement in figure-of-merit2 (FoM2), achieving 2.68 ns $\cdot $ pJ/ $\mu $ m ${^{{3}}} \cdot $ V at bootstrap supply ( $V {_{\text {BS}}}$ ) of 5 V, and  $3\times $  improvement when supplied at 3.3 V.

In masking-based defenses, secure substitution-boxes (S-boxes) and effective masking schemes are paramount. Additionally, the time-based hiding techniques, leveraging multiple clocks for individual encryption operations, offer significant protection. This article introduces a novel multiscale countermeasure: an improved tower field masking scheme integrated with an affine transformation-based dynamic S-box. Crucially, we incorporate Gold sequences to generate both a random clock source for horizontal hiding and random values for masking. Extensive evaluation using up to five million power traces demonstrates the robustness of our approach against standard correlation power analysis (CPA) and alignment preprocessing techniques, including sliding window and amplitude peak localization. Experimental results show a measurement-to-disclosure (MTD) improvement of at least  $150\times $  compared to unprotected implementations using stand-alone masking and  $375\times $  with our multiscale approach. Furthermore, we demonstrate resilience against recent robust profiled deep learning SCA, which could only recover four subkeys even with one million traces.</description></item><item><title>A 40-nm Training-Inference STT-MRAM Near-Memory Computing Macro for Memory-Augmented Neural Network Acceleration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11135443</link><description>Recently, memory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) have gained significant attention as a critical solution for few-shot learning (FSL). These networks leverage external memory to store prior knowledge, thereby enhancing classification efficiency. Spin-transfer torque magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM) is particularly suited for this application due to its compact cell size, excellent data retention, and scalability. In this article, we introduce a STT-MRAM-based near-memory computing (NMC) macro specifically designed for MANNs. Our approach incorporates several key innovations aimed at overcoming challenges in hardware implementation while improving MANN performance as follows: 1) a parallel computing architecture within the NMC to expedite  $L1$  distance computations; 2) a memory invert coding (MIC) and self-termination write (STW) scheme that reduce write operations and energy consumption, addressing the issues of frequent writes and high write currents during the training phase of MANNs; 3) a dynamic offset-compensation sense amplifier (DOC-SA) and high-throughput switch-capacitor (HTSC) readout scheme to improve read accuracy and throughput, tackling low read margins and limited readout bandwidth; 4) an exploration of MANN architectures validates the reusability of the NMC macro.

The designed receiver employs a double quadrature (DQ) architecture and a hybrid poly-phase filter (PPF) is proposed to achieve an impressive image rejection ratio (IRR) to meet the 99.99% higher fidelity requirements in quantum error correction (QEC). In addition, gain tuning at different stages of the low noise amplifier (LNA) facilitates a broadband gain and flatness, while the subsequent receiver chains of a broadband mixer and an improved four-input intermediate frequency amplifier (IF-AMP) provide further gain compensation. Fabricated with a standard 55-nm CMOS technology, the LNA achieves a measured power gain of 27.4 dB, with a &#8722;3-dB bandwidth (BW) of 5.2 GHz at 6 K. The measured cryogenic noise figure (NF) ranges from 0.79 to 1 dB consuming merely 5.5 mW from a 1.2-V supply. Overall receiver measurements demonstrate a peak gain of 48.2 dB, a &#8722;5-dB flatness of 3.2 GHz, and an IRR that exceeds 40 dB at 6 K.

Given the high performance and reconfigurability, field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based accelerators for MoE-ViTs emerge, delivering substantial gains over general-purpose processors. However, existing accelerators often fall short of efficiently managing the highly dynamic and sparse computation patterns, resulting in suboptimal tradeoffs between resource utilization and performance. To address the inefficiencies in deploying MoE-ViTs on FPGAs, we present MoE-Sched, a novel end-to-end accelerator that embraces a scheduling-centric design philosophy. Rather than optimizing isolated kernels, MoE-Sched coordinates multilevel scheduling, from fine-grained intrakernel streaming to module reuse and multidie mapping, to holistically balance latency, bandwidth (BW), and resource usage. We further integrate a hardware-aware quantization scheme tailored for streaming attention and sparse expert execution, preserving accuracy while minimizing overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that our accelerator achieves nearly 100 frames/s on M3ViT-tiny, a  $3.13\times $  improvement in throughput, and over 75% energy reduction compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) FPGA MoE accelerators, while maintaining less than 1% accuracy loss across vision benchmarks. Our implementation will be open-sourced.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Efficient High Resolution Vision Transformer Processor Exploiting Token Similarity Beyond Token Merging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11175089</link><description>Token merging is a widely adopted technique in vision transformers (ViTs) to reduce computation with minimal accuracy degradation. However, in tasks that require fine-grained outputs, such as text-unified object recognition, aggressive merging reaches a limit due to accuracy loss. To address this, we introduce a method that exploits residual token similarity beyond the merging threshold using difference computing, which significantly improves energy efficiency. The proposed processor integrates the post merging residual difference (PMRD) algorithm, which first reduces 34% of tokens through merging, then applies difference computing to the remaining tokens. This results in a 31% reduction in effective bit operations by leveraging residual similarity. To further exploit the resulting bit-level sparsity, the processor employs sparsity-separated accumulation with sign-magnitude representation (SSA-SM) and a bi-directional dynamic memory allocation (BDA) to optimize both computation and memory access. These enhancements yield an additional 29.4% computational energy savings. Overall, the system achieves a  $2.22\times $  improvement in energy efficiency and delivers 7.23 TOPS/W on the MS COCO dataset for text-unified object recognition.</description></item><item><title>SVRoM: A 9.52-mW Video Understanding Smart Vision SoC With On-Chip Sensing and Similarity-Aware SRAM/ROM CIM Macro</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168280</link><description>The rapid growth of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), extended reality (XR), and intelligent surveillance systems has driven increasing demand for video understanding tasks on edge devices. However, supporting such tasks on edge devices remains challenging due to the limited computational resources, memory constraints, power budgets, and high data transition latency. To address these challenges, this work proposes an ultralow-power smart vision System-on-Chip (SoC) with the following features: 1) a bitline segmented, parallel-charging read-only memory (ROM) compute-in-memory (CIM) macro with power gating and coupled coding; 2) heterogeneous similarity-aware hybrid SRAM/ROM cores to exploit temporal similarity with high core utilization; 3) an intracore and intercore pipeline with hierarchical dataflow for low-power data transmission; 4) a tilewise mixed-precision weight quantization and mapping scheme for weight data compression; and 5) a hierarchical multimodal system trigger mechanism utilizing an on-chip CMOS imager with near sensor caching to skip unnecessary inferences. The proposed ROM CIM macro achieves an area efficiency of 0.753&#8211;1.673 TOPS/mm2 and a storage density of 4706 Kb/mm2, achieving a  $3.2\!\!-\!\!14.83\times $  improvement in density Figure of Merit (FoM) over the state-of-the-art (SoTA) ROM CIM designs.

This article introduces a split-CDAC design for improving area efficiency for higher bit resolution by reducing parasitic sensitivity and mismatch. A fundamental reason for the increased parasitic sensitivity stems from the fractional sizing of the bridge capacitor and a small redundant capacitor at the split node. The proposed split-CDAC uses a unit capacitor-based bridge capacitor and a proportionally scaled large redundant unit capacitor, which minimizes these effects to a large extent while achieving linearity. It achieves six times better parasitic sensitivity than a conventional split-CDAC by using six-unit capacitors as a bridge capacitor and 12 times better area efficiency than the conventional binary-weighted CDAC. The proposed fully common-centroided and shielded unit capacitor array, implemented in a 65 nm CMOS process, effectively reduces parasitic and mismatch sensitivity using a simple layout structure. The implementation achieves an INL of less than 1.2 LSB, measured across 21 chips, without mismatch calibration and opens new possibilities for high-precision applications across diverse domains.</description></item><item><title>COPIC: A Codesigned Accelerator for Efficient Octree-Based Learned Point Cloud Compression at Edge</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11201934</link><description>With the growing adoption of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology and the increasing resolution of captured data, efficient point cloud compression (PCC) has become a critical challenge. While PCC is essential for reducing bandwidth and storage demands, existing octree-based learned PCC methods face two fundamental bottlenecks: 1) octree construction and serialization that involve irregular, pointwise memory accesses that are difficult to parallelize and 2) autoregressive entropy model inference that requires heavy computation. These issues lead to high latency and energy consumption, making real-time deployment on edge devices impractical. This article introduces COPIC, a hardware accelerator designed for real-time PCC on edge devices. COPIC integrates two key components. The first is OctCAM, a content-addressable-memory (CAM)-based module for rapid octree construction and serialization. By enabling hardware-level parallel search, OctCAM significantly reduces the latency and energy consumption caused by irregular memory access patterns in octree processing. The second is PCC-Engine, a dedicated neural network inference module. Combined with a lightweight PCC-TinyAttention network and a window-based key-value caching approach, it further minimizes execution latency and power usage. Experimental results show that COPIC achieves a  $25.9\times $  speedup compared to GPU implementations, with a total processing latency of 40.1 ms and an average energy consumption of 0.23 J per frame, while delivering a compression rate 12.4% higher than standard proposals.</description></item><item><title>FPGA-Based Real-Time ECG Classification System Using Quantized Inception-ResNeXt Neural Network and CWT Approximation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11216425</link><description>This article presents a software&#8211;hardware codesigned field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based real-time electrocardiogram (ECG) classification system that combines methodological and practical innovations to achieve state-of-the-art performance with an ultracompact model.

However, conventional SRAM CIM architectures face two key limitations: low output resistance in single-transistor transmission paths and voltage instability on charge-sharing bitlines. These limitations collectively degrade computational accuracy to 4&#8211;5 LSB-level integral nonlinearity (INL), restricting practical deployment. This work proposes a regulated-cascode 9T SRAM cell that enhances analog computation accuracy using a high-impedance transmission path through a cascode configuration and stabilizing the discharge amount of the bitline from a single cell via active feedback regulation.

A compact diagonal-block parallel (DBP) mapping scheme and a novel arithmetic flow are proposed to address the hardware underutilization issue in conventional two-sided stationary bit-parallel CIM architectures. Specifically, the DBP mapping method is implemented to enhance the throughput by reorganizing the intermediate and final results into diagonal memory blocks, effectively reducing the vacant CIM cells caused by the dynamic bit width during computing. In addition, the proposed hardware-efficient arithmetic flows employ: 1) a pipelined ADD scheme to reduce the critical path latency in near-memory computing units; and 2) shift-based arithmetic operations that halve the hardware resources required for multiplication and division while reducing energy consumption. The post-layout simulations on 28-nm CMOS technology show that the proposed DBP-CIM achieves higher energy efficiency and throughput for general-purpose arithmetic operations, compared with state-of-the-art works. Furthermore, evaluations on the general-purpose benchmarks demonstrate that the DBP-CIM reduces energy consumption and computing cycles by up to 55.9% and 60.9%, compared to the conventional bit-parallel CIM.</description></item><item><title>A Digital FP CIM Macro With Cascaded Row-Elimination for Exponent Comparison and In-Memory Mantissa Sparsity Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11215842</link><description>Floating-point (FP) computing-in-memory (CIM) addresses the energy efficiency bottleneck of von Neumann architectures and fixed-point CIM in high-accuracy neural network training/inference.

However, the multihead self-attention (MHSA) in a transformer requires extensive computation and memory bandwidth. Techniques such as sparse attention and attention formula reordering have been explored recently to mitigate these challenges. However, existing processors still struggle to process LLMs efficiently. To overcome these limitations, an energy-efficient compute-in/near-memory (CINM) embedded dynamic random access memory (eDRAM) processor CINELL is proposed, incorporating the following three key features: 1) an attention block fusion computation (ABFC), which maximizes data reuse in the attention map, reduces external memory access (EMA) by 85.86%, and improves hardware utilization to 86.1%; 2) a CINM architecture designed to address the imbalance between memory and computation, while the heterogeneous pipeline reduces the system latency by 77.27%; and 3) a compute-in-memory (CIM) array that supports the cross-read operation (CRO) addresses data direction conflicts, achieving a 98.44% reduction in latency, while dual-row computation (DRC) with reduced adder logic (RAL) improves energy efficiency by  $1.58\times $ .

In practical application scenarios, the sparsity of the signal is often unknown, which requires reconstruction algorithms to operate under sparsity-adaptive conditions. Existing sparsity adaptive algorithms have various limitations, and no algorithm has demonstrated good reconstruction performance in noisy real-world environments. This article fully considers reconstruction accuracy, robustness, and hardware complexity and proposes a sparsity adaptive atomic correlation difference pursuit (SA-ACDP) algorithm to achieve a balance among reconstruction accuracy, robustness, and hardware complexity.

To address these issues, the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) is considered a promising solution due to its nonvolatility and its compatibility with traditional CMOS manufacturing processes. In this work, we propose a novel nonvolatile (NV) latch consisting of inverters and MTJs, namely, NVLIM, which provides nonvolatility and robust partial tolerance against triple-node-upsets (TNUs) at low cost. NVLIM integrates a TNU-tolerant block based on CMOS with a backup-restore block using MTJs. Simulation results incorporating process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, bias temperature instability (BTI) impact, and Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the balanced performance in terms of nonvolatility, robust partial TNU tolerance, and comprehensive overhead of the proposed latch.</description></item><item><title>A Highly Reliable RRAM-Based 12T2R NVSRAM Architecture With Dual-Layer ECC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11219395</link><description>Static random access memory (SRAM) plays a critical role in chips due to its high-speed access capabilities, but it suffers from data loss upon power-down and is susceptible to radiation-induced faults. Nonvolatile SRAM (NVSRAM) has attracted substantial research attention for combining the high-speed operation of SRAM with the nonvolatile storage capabilities of emerging memory technologies. This article proposes a 12T2R NVSRAM cell based on resistive random access memory (RRAM), achieving nanosecond-scale data backup and recovery. The novel design integrates an independent RRAM operation path and an SRAM power-gating switch, ensuring reliable backup and low-power sleep mode. Building on the memory array, the system further integrates a power management module, control and driver circuitry, and a dual-layer error correction code (ECC) strategy. This holistic co-design across device, circuit, and architecture levels delivers enhanced reliability, energy efficiency, and fault tolerance. Simulation results under 65 nm CMOS process demonstrate significant improvements in key performance metrics, including speed, power consumption, noise margin, store/restore yield, and bit error rate (BER). All functional modules meet the design specifications, with markedly improved data backup and restoration success rates, providing a promising solution for next-generation high-performance nonvolatile memory (NVM) systems.</description></item><item><title>An SAR-Assisted Noise-Shaping Pipeline ADC With Gain-Boosted Cascoded Floating Inverter Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192756</link><description>This brief presents a successive approximation register (SAR)-assisted noise-shaping (NS) pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with the reusing feedback capacitor (RFC) technique.

However, the highly anticipated neuromorphic transformer still faces significant challenges in energy efficiency due to its heavy computational workload (primarily stemming from the self-attention mechanism), making edge deployment difficult. To address this problem, this work proposes a neuron inhibition mechanism that identifies and bypasses the computation of inactive neurons (i.e., those with extremely negative membrane potentials (MPs) and do not fire spikes). It introduces additional neuron sparsity into neuromorphic computing, significantly reducing the computational workload during inference. The mechanism is implemented using a configurable negative MP threshold. If a neuron&#8217;s MP falls below this threshold, a mask is generated to bypass the neuron in subsequent calculations. This technology facilitates the development of a sparse2 synaptic processing unit (S2-SPE), which performs computations only on synapses associated with valid spike inputs in active (non-inhibited) neurons, thereby efficiently leveraging both neuron and spike sparsity. Eventually, a neuromorphic attention core is developed based on the S2-SPE, and its effectiveness is validated on various datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the core can bypass over 98% of invalid calculations in the neuromorphic attention mechanism, achieving an outstanding energy efficiency of sub-0.06 pJ/SOP, which represents over 50% improvement compared to the baseline and outperforms related state-of-the-art (SOTA) works. This work is expected to advance neuromorphic hardware toward greater energy efficiency and facilitate its deployment in edge applications.</description></item><item><title>A Buffer-in-Loop NS-SAR ADC With CDAC Sharing-Error Feedback Structure and kT/C Noise Cancellation in 0.18-&#956;m CMOS Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11222792</link><description>Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with a wide input range and power efficiency are highly desired in various applications like robust industrial sensor data acquisition and bioelectrical signal monitoring, where successive approximation register (SAR) ADCs fabricated in mature process nodes account for a large proportion. This brief presents a buffer-in-loop (BIL) noise-shaping (NS) SAR ADC with a proposed CDAC sharing (CS)-error-feedback (EF) structure and kT/ $C$  cancellation method in 180 nm. Compared with traditional EF methods, this CS-EF NS scheme takes advantage of the simple BIL structure and reduces the input signal degradation problem due to charge sharing with the input signal or parasitic capacitor of the series EF capacitor in the signal path, and enhances the system robustness.

Traditional noncoherent modulation schemes, such as pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), are reaching their scalability limits at higher data rates, making coherent detection increasingly attractive due to its higher spectral efficiency. Coherent detection systems leverage advanced modulation formats such as dual-polarization quadrature amplitude modulation (DP-QAM) but typically depend on complex digital signal processing (DSP) for polarization, phase, and timing recovery, resulting in increased power consumption. To address this, analog signal processing techniques have been explored for low-power coherent optical receivers (RXs) with several quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK)-based designs reported. However, 16-QAM remains underexplored due to its higher complexity. This article presents a low-power 16-QAM coherent optical RX designed for short-reach data center interconnects, featuring a decision-directed 16-QAM phase detector (PD) that improves carrier-phase recovery and tracking by leveraging both inner and outer constellation symbols. Fabricated in a 28-nm complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS), the RX achieves a bit error ratio (BER) of 1E&#8722;10 at 64 Gb/s with a 20-MHz carrier-phase recovery loop bandwidth (BW) while consuming 1.54 pJ/bit. These results demonstrate the potential for scalable and power-efficient coherent RXs in future short-reach optical interconnects.</description></item><item><title>A 108 Gb/s PAM-4 VCSEL-Based Direct-Drive Optical Engine for Co-Packaged Optics Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165151</link><description>This article presents a multimode vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL)-based direct-drive optical engine for co-packaged optics (CPOs) applications that employs pulse amplitude modulation (PAM)-4 to enhance shoreline bandwidth (BW) density and features a compact direct optical wiring (DOW) approach for on-package fiber termination.

In HBM standards, WDQS buffers experience abrupt load current ( $I_{\mathrm {L}}$ ) transitions, leading to significant voltage droop in the environment of the complexity of the power delivery network (PDN). However, conventional analog LDOs (ALDOs) and event-driven LDOs (ED-LDOs) suffer from a limited loop bandwidth, making it difficult to prevent large voltage droops and PSIJ degradation. To address these challenges, the proposed CA-HLDO leverages a unique property of memory systems: the magnitude and timing of  $I_{\mathrm {L}}$  are deterministic based on commands from the host. Exploiting this property, the CA-HLDO proactively sources a current ( $I_{\mathrm {D}}$ ) that matches  $I_{\mathrm {L}}$  precisely at the time of its occurrence, thereby minimizing voltage droop and reducing the settling time ( $T_{\mathrm {S}}$ ). The architecture includes an  $I_{\mathrm {D}}$  adaptor to dynamically adjust the magnitude of  $I_{\mathrm {D}}$  and a control signal generator (CSG) to calibrate the timing of  $I_{\mathrm {D}}$  sourcing. Fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS, the CA-HLDO achieved sub-10-mV voltage droop and 400-ps settling time using a small output capacitor and minimal quiescent current ( $I_{\mathrm {Q}}$ ). In addition, it provides a power-supply rejection (PSR) more than 10 dB across all frequencies, effectively mitigating PSIJ caused by a noisy and complex PDN.</description></item><item><title>IBM Telum II Microprocessor: 5.5 GHz With On-Die AI and Data Processing, and Design&#8211;Technology Co-Optimizations for Power, Area, and Reliability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11173265</link><description>The IBM Telum II microprocessor features eight cores operating at a base frequency of 5.5 GHz, ten 36-MB L2 caches achieving 3.6-ns access latency, a 360-MB virtual L3 cache, and a new on-chip data processing unit (DPU) for I/O acceleration.

Owing to its short modeling time, computational simplicity, and high rendering quality, it is expected to replace traditional 3-D graphics on edge devices. However, its substantial memory access requirements and the challenges of real-time modification present major barriers to deployment on mobile augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) platforms. We present a spatial computing system-on-chip (SoC), IRIS, to enable real-time, spatially interactive rendering with surface-aware modelling (SAM).

The proposed CR-PAM3 signaling provides tolerance to supply noise and reference offset in SE chiplet or die-to-die (D2D) interfaces by using forwarded clock as reference voltages instead of generating them at the RX side. To minimize power consumption for PAM3, a differentially weighted data driver is employed. The proposed XTC-combined FS-puller helps voltage level transition while canceling FEXT from adjacent channels. A decision feedback equalizer (DFE)-embedded sampler enables low-power feedback within 1&#8198;UI by eliminating the CML summer structure and directly adding a tap branch to the sampler. A digital on-chip foreground training sequence is used to sequentially train TX per-lane deskew, clock swing level, and RX quadrature error corrector (QEC). Six data lanes, two clock lanes, and one replica lane for testing are implemented using an on-chip 2-mm channel in a 28-nm CMOS technology. In the presence of 200-mVpp 120-MHz sinusoidal supply noise injected at TX, horizontal and vertical eyes with CR-PAM3 are measured as 0.34&#8198;UI and 121&#8198;mV at BER  $\lt 10^{-12}$ , while the conventional PAM3 eye is closed.</description></item><item><title>Laser Voltage Probing Attack Detection via Leakage Shift Monitoring Without Dedicated Sensors at 4.35% Area Overhead</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11173930</link><description>In this article, a novel architecture to detect laser voltage probing (LVP) attacks is introduced to make silicon systems secure against such threats, while pushing the area overhead to a level that is compatible with low-cost chip products. The inherent and sharp temperature rise due to the presence of a laser beam (i.e., an attack) is detected by sensing the resulting exponential leakage increase. In turn, this is achieved by sensing the leakage of the logic under protection via intermittent power gating, suppressing altogether area-hungry and explicit sensors in prior art. In particular, the rate of the virtual supply decay rate is sensed via simple and local voltage comparison. The proposed approach is seamlessly incorporated into an automated digital design flow, and the inherent resilience against process/voltage/temperature variations suppresses any postsilicon calibration. Extensive LVP attacks on a 28 nm testchip demonstrate attack decision margin well above six standard deviations, insignificant power overhead, percentage point-range performance degradation, and 4.35% area overhead ( $13.3{\times }$  better than prior best). This enables for the first time ubiquitous inclusion of LVP protection even in low-cost consumer electronics.</description></item><item><title>A 128-Gb/s PAM-4 Transmitter With Edge-Boosting Pulse Generator and Pre-Emphasis Asymmetric Fractional-Spaced FFE in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10967239</link><description>This article presents a 128-Gb/s current-mode four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) transmitter (TX) with a pre-emphasis asymmetric fractional-spaced feed-forward equalizer (AFS-FFE) and an edge-boosting pulse generator. The proposed pre-emphasis AFS-FFE mitigates unequal switching jitter (SWJ) in PAM-4 eyes, extending the minimum eye width by 67%. Additionally, the reconfigurable UI-spaced feed-forward equalizer (FFE) enhances the precision of the equalizer. The edge-boosting pulse generator accelerates the edge-transition speed of the driver&#8217;s output signal, increasing the TX&#8217;s bandwidth by 26%. Moreover, in the data path, the latch-minimized serializer eliminates 4:1 MUX input-side latches, thereby reducing the power consumption of the TX data path by 36%. Fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, measurement results show that the PAM-4 TX can operate in both PAM-4 and non-return-to-zero (NRZ) modes, achieving a maximum data rate of 128 Gb/s with an energy efficiency of 1.5 pJ/bit.</description></item><item><title>A 15-Gb/s PAM-3 Transceiver With Hybrid Equalization and Time-Domain Decoder for High-Bandwidth-Memory Interfaces</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966012</link><description>This study presents a 15-Gb/s three-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-3) transceiver (TRX) with a hybrid equalizer and a time-domain decoder using a low supply voltage for high-bandwidth-memory (HBM) interfaces in a 28-nm CMOS technology. To achieve low power consumption in next-generation HBM interfaces, the transmitter employs a hybrid equalizer composed of integrated pulsewidth modulation, a voltage mode feed-forward equalizer, and a delay line controller (DLC). The proposed hybrid equalizer technique reduces input/output capacitance, minimizes bandwidth degradation, and provides effective inter-symbol interference equalization and significant power reduction. The receiver utilizes a time-domain decoder, which halves the number of comparators and reference voltages compared to conventional decoder methods, minimizing hardware cost and design complexity. Additionally, using a low supply voltage in the decoder results in a slower rising slope of the comparator&#8217;s output, increasing the decodable range and enhancing power efficiency. Consequently, the proposed TRX achieves a 15-Gb/s data rate with an energy efficiency of 0.253 pJ/bit and occupies 0.0135 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A Duty-Cycle Switching 30-Gb/s Burst-Mode CDR With 1.6-ns Locking Time in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10960670</link><description>This article presents a closed-loop type burst-mode clock and data recovery (BM-CDR) circuit with fast phase offset detection using 8/3x-fractional oversampling in the periodic preamble. The proposed phase offset detector achieves a resolution of 1/8 unit intervals (UIs) with a detection time of 4 UIs. A 2x-oversampling closed-loop bang-bang CDR is performed after the phase offset detection to provide jitter filtering. The switching between these two different oversampling ratios is realized in a single multi-phase clock generator (MPCG) by changing the duty-cycle in four differential quarter-rate clocks. Furthermore, fast duty-cycle switching (DCS) is introduced in the injection-locked ring oscillator (ILRO) design to speed up the transition from one sampling ratio to another. A prototype fabricated in 28-nm CMOS achieves a locking time of 1.6 ns at 30-Gb/s data rate, a BER of 1E-12 with a recovered clock integrated rms jitter of 398.4 fs. The jitter tolerance curve shows a corner frequency around 20 MHz with a 20-dB/dec slope in the low-frequency region. The receiver including the proposed CDR consumes 75.53 mW with 0.9-V supply and occupies an area of 0.148 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Jitter Fractional- N Digital PLL With Spur Cancellation Based on a Multi-DTC Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10976732</link><description>This work presents a low-jitter and low-spur fractional-N digital phase-locked loop (PLL) with a multi-path topology, each path having its own digital-to-time converter (DTC) and phase detector (PD). We show that, by driving each DTC with properly shifted quantization error sequences and then combining the PD outputs, the dominant fractional spurs due to DTC non-linearity can be canceled out and a significant reduction in DTC jitter is obtained. A number of background adaptive digital algorithms are introduced to ensure a robust operation across PVT spreads. The implemented PLL prototype, fabricated in a 28 nm CMOS process, has an active area of 0.36 mm2 and dissipates 17.9 mW. At 9.25 GHz near-integer channels, the measured worst case fractional spur is below  $-\textrm {60}$  dBc, with an rms jitter of 77.1 fs, leading to  $-\textrm {249.7}$  dB jitter-power figure-of-merit.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Band RF Transmitter Employing a Transformer-Based N-Path Switched-Capacitor Modulator for CIM3 Suppression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964110</link><description>A multi-band high-linearity radio frequency (RF) transmitter features a transformer-based N-Path switched-capacitor (SC) modulator to perform third-order harmonic (3x $f_{\mathrm {LO}})$  suppression, and tunable high-Q bandpass filtering to reduce the out-of-band (OB) noise emission. The intrinsic lowpass characteristic of the transformer also aids in suppressing the 3x $f_{\mathrm {LO}}$  harmonic terms in the modulator, reducing the third-order cross-intermodulation product (CIM3) at the transmitter output. To enhance the transmitter efficiency and preserve the linearity, the power amplifier (PA) driver features a class-A/B transconductor (g ${}_{\mathrm {m}})$  parallelized with a gm linearizer biased in the triode region. Fabricated in 65-nm CMOS, the transmitter measures a power efficiency of 5.1% at a 2.3-dBm output, while showing CIM ${_{3}}~{\lt -}60$  dBc and ACLR ${_{1}}~{\lt -}46$  dBc.

To reduce power loss when  $R^{{3}}$  rectifier is in freewheeling mode, transmission power control is essential, with accurate detection of the receiver (RX) mode being the key requirement. Currently, most detecting methods rely on a fixed threshold derived from the steady-state transmission current amplitude, which is only effective in a narrow-range coupling coefficient  $k$ . In this article, phase shift and near-zero-time detection methods are proposed to detect the RX mode correctly under a wide range  $k$ . The proposed method is based on the transient behavior in mode transition, which is insensitive to  $k$ . Moreover, a hybrid transmission power control, composed of a 1/15-density pulse frequency modulation and power transistors size-switching control, is introduced for further efficiency improvement. Both the transmitter (TX) and RX chips in the proposed WPT system have been fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS process. Measured under the coil distance  $d_{\text {coil}}$  from 2 to 20 mm ( $k$  ranging from 0.39 to 0.1), the maximum output power  $P_{\text {O}}$  is 950 mW, and the peak efficiency reaches 74.3%. Furthermore, efficiency improvement is observed across various values of  $k$ , with a 27.9% peak enhancement at 75-mW  $P_{\text {O}}$  and 10-mm  $d_{\text {coil}}$  ( $k$  of 0.23).</description></item><item><title>Phase-Scalable CF-Cross-Connected-Based Hybrid DC-DC Converter With Auto VCF Balancing and Inactive CF Charging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964111</link><description>This article presents a multiple-phase (MP) flying  ${C}_{\mathrm { F}}$ -cross-connected (CCC)-based hybrid dc-dc converter for 12-V input to point-of-load (PoL) conversion. First, we illustrate the evolution of the proposed MP CCC converter from the conventional two-phase (2P) CCC converter. The proposed topology enables easy scalability in the number of active phases with the finest granularity. Second, we compare potential &#8220; ${I}_{\mathrm { L}}$ -balance&#8221; and &#8220; ${V}_{\mathrm { CF}}$ -balance&#8221; control schemes, selecting the &#8220; ${V}_{\mathrm { CF}}$ -balance&#8221; one for its higher efficiency and wider voltage conversion ratio (VCR) range. Third, in light-load conditions where certain phases are disabled and their  ${C}_{\mathrm { F}}$ s are discharged by leakage currents, this topology facilitates an inactive- $C_{\mathrm { F}}$  charging scheme. This prevents overstress on inactive switches and mitigates large inrush charging currents upon reactivation of  ${C}_{\mathrm { F}}$ s. Fabricated in a 180-nm bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) process, the prototype four-phase converter achieves measured peak efficiency of 90.3% and 91.6% at 1.2- and 1.8 V- ${V}_{\mathrm { O}}$ , respectively. The easy scalability extends the VCR range and the load current range with high efficiency. Furthermore, it is suited for fault-tolerant schemes.</description></item><item><title>A Compact Photocurrent Recording IC With High-Linearity Dual PWM Buffered R-DACs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966013</link><description>This article introduces a photocurrent recording front-end, emphasizing both energy efficiency and compact size. The proposed front-end circuit comprises a voltage-controlled oscillator-based quantizer (VCOQ) and a digital low-pass filter for feedback current, optimizing conversion efficiency. Furthermore, a dual pulse-width modulation (PWM)-based buffered resistive digital-to-analog converter (R-DAC) is employed for enhanced linearity and area efficiency. The PWM logic, implemented with a digital counter instead of conventional structures, reduces dynamic power requirements. Additionally, integrating a coarse R-DAC with extended bit depth into the digital filter feedback loop significantly enhances dynamic range (DR). The proposed architecture is further reinforced by loop gain calibration and a fast-settling feedforward path to mitigate parasitic effects on the passive integrator and reduce the data loss due to saturation caused by rapid input current fluctuations.

The proposed design strategy formulates the WPT design as an optimization problem and solves it by fully-numerical computation to achieve high-frequency LI operation. A multi-objective evaluation function is given to achieve the LI operation, which evaluates output voltage, power-delivery efficiency, and total harmonic distortion. The class-EF WPT system designed using the proposed method achieved narrower output voltage variations and higher power-delivery efficiency than the analysis-based design system. Additionally, the proposed design algorithm identifies parameter sets that were never found through the analysis-based design. Namely, only a small amount of current flows through the previous harmonic resonant filter of the class-EF inverter. These results demonstrate the potential of ML-based design in the field of power electronics.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Circuit Performance Prediction Using Machine Learning: From Schematic to Layout and Silicon Measurement With Minimal Data Input</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11114348</link><description>We present an ML-driven framework for predicting circuit performance metrics, bridging the gap between schematic and layout simulations, multi-process corner analysis, and measured silicon data. We demonstrate this using 14nm and 5nm FinFET-based ring oscillators, by collecting data across varying supply voltages, temperatures, and process corners. Using three baseline ML models&#8212;XGBoost, Random Forest, and a Neural Network&#8212;we simulate real-world design scenarios where parameter fine-tuning may not always be feasible. Key tasks include predicting layout performance from schematic data, performance prediction across process corners, and fabricated chip performance. Our results show that these models can achieve less than 5% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for power and frequency prediction while reducing required simulations by more than  $2\times $ . When migrating from 14nm to 5nm, XGBoost and Neural Network achieve high accuracy (&gt;0.99  $R^{2}$ ) using just 10% of the otherwise required 5nm simulations. We also present an extensive robustness analysis to demonstrate that our results are not limited to a single data split or initialization. By varying random seeds across multiple runs, we evaluate the stability of each model with respect to algorithm initialization and the selection of training data subsets. This demonstrates that the observed accuracy is consistent and not the result of a specific, favorable configuration. This framework offers a promising approach to accelerating circuit design across technology nodes by reducing simulation costs while maintaining accuracy in predicting performance.</description></item><item><title>An Integer-N Reference-Double-Sampling PLL for Frequency-Multiplied Octa-Phase Clock Generation Achieving &#8722;251.9 dB FOMJitter-N</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131491</link><description>This paper presents a reference double-sampling phase-locked loop (RDSPLL) that integrates frequency multiplication and octa-phase clock generation into a single system, significantly reducing power consumption. A differential ring oscillator (DRO) is employed to generate octa-phase clocks with high phase accuracy. The reference double-sampling technique extends the loop bandwidth, effectively suppressing phase noise from the ring oscillator and thereby reducing jitter. To achieve accurate and efficient phase error detection, we proposed a novel offset-compensated hybrid phase detector (OCH-PD), featuring an offset calibration and a comparator-ADC hybrid quantizer. The offset calibration utilizes the CDAC to dynamically compensate for the mismatch in double-sampling, improving jitter and spur performance. The hybrid quantizer supports dynamic mode switching based on different locking states: during the coarse frequency locking phase, it operates in the ADC mode to accelerate the locking process; once a stable lock is achieved, it switches to the comparator mode to enable low-power, high-speed quantization. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the prototype achieves 674 fs RMS jitter at 2.4 GHz while consuming only 3.43 mW, resulting in a  $\text {FOM}_{\text {Jitter-N}}$  of -251.9 dB. With offset calibration, the reference spur at 100 MHz is suppressed from -56 dBc to -80 dBc, and the jitter is reduced from 1.42 ps to 674 fs. The locking time improves from  $10.5~{\mu }$ s to  $1.6~{\mu }$ s using the hybrid quantizer. The eight-phase accuracy remains better than 1&#176; over the frequency range of 2-2.8 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A Compact, Power-Efficient, and On-the-Fly I2C-to-SPI Converter for Distributed E-Textile Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073551</link><description>This paper presents a 0.36-mm2 I2C-to-SPI converter chip designed for electronic textile (E-textile) applications, featuring an on-the-fly conversion scheme that eliminates the need for on-chip data buffers and internal clock generation. By leveraging the synchronous nature of both I2C and SPI protocols, the proposed design forwards each incoming I2C data bit, SDA (Serial Data Line) directly to the SPI output using the I2C serial clock line (SCL), thereby reducing both area and power consumption. Two versions of the chip are proposed: a &#8216;full&#8217; die and a &#8216;compact&#8217; die. The converter enables seamless integration into distributed in-textile architectures by minimizing silicon overhead. The &#8216;full&#8217; die implementation achieves a  $7.33\times $  area reduction compared to commercially available I2C-to-SPI converters, while the &#8216;compact&#8217; version further reduces the footprint by  $14.73\times $  through the use of a small corner seal-ring and a linear pad ring layout. Measurement results confirm robust operation at ultra-fast I2C frequency (5 MHz), consuming only 0.379 mW for the &#8216;full&#8217; die and 0.333 mW for the &#8216;compact&#8217; variant. At standard I2C speeds (400 kHz), the converter demonstrates a  $48\times $  improvement (&#8216;full&#8217; die) in power efficiency over commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions, making it an effective and unobtrusive solution for next-generation E-textile systems.</description></item><item><title>A Mode-Reconfigurable Second-Order NS-SAR ADC With NTF Synchronous Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045517</link><description>This paper presents a mode-reconfigurable 2nd-order noise-shaping successive-approximation-register (NS-SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) featured with the ability of optimizing the noise transfer function (NTF) synchronously. Three operation modes, the energy-saving (ES) mode, the normal (NM) mode, and the high-resolution (HR) mode, can be supported by reconfiguring the resolution of the internal SAR ADC (N ${}_{\mathrm {SAR}}$ ) and the oversampling rate (OSR), while the NTF optimization is realized by modulating locations of zeros and poles in the context of a specific mode to enhance the NS effect. The prototype ADC is fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS and operates under a 1.8-V supply. Operating at 5MS/s sampling rate, the ADC&#8217;s OSR can be configured as 8 or 16 in different operation modes, so its bandwidth can be configured as 312.5kHz or 156.25kHz. With NSAR and OSR reconfigured to be 8-bit and 8 for the ES mode, it achieves a signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 80.3dB and consumes  $201\mu $ W. Attributing to the NTF optimization, 27% power saving can be reached in the ES mode with respect to that when the optimization were disabled for the same SNDR. In the HR mode, NSAR and OSR are set to be 9-bit and 16, respectively. And a SNDR of 93.3dB is obtained at the expense of consuming  $280\mu $ W. It is evidenced that the SNDR can be boosted by 6.4dB owe to the NTF optimization, resulting in an optimal SNDR-based Schreier figure-of-merit (FoM ${}_{\mathrm {S}}$ ) of 180.8dB for the ADC. The values for NSAR and OSR are determined to be 9-bit and 8 for the NM mode, and the achievable SNDR is 88.2dB. The occupied core area is 0.537 mm2.</description></item><item><title>LearnAFE: Circuit-Algorithm Co-Design Framework for Learnable Audio Analog Front-End</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11044866</link><description>This paper presents a circuit-algorithm co-design framework for learnable analog front-end (AFE) in audio signal classification.

More specifically, the transfer function parameters of an analog bandpass filter (BPF) bank are tuned in a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-aware training loop for the classifier. Using a co-design loss function LBPF, this work shows superior optimization of both the filter bank and the classifier. Implemented in open-source SKY130 130nm CMOS process, the optimized design achieved 90.5%&#8211;94.2% accuracy for 10-keyword classification task across a wide range of input signal SNR from 5 dB to 20 dB, with only 22k classifier parameters. Compared to conventional approach, the proposed audio AFE achieves 8.7% and 12.9% reduction in power and capacitor area respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 15&#8211;28 GHz Low-Noise Amplifier With 0.75-dB Gain Ripple Across the Full K-Band</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11060582</link><description>The design of a 15&#8211;28 GHz broadband low-noise amplifier (LNA) is presented, employing a magnetically coupled resonator (MCR) to achieve simultaneous bandwidth extension and output matching.

The measured noise figure (NF) ranges from 2.9 to 3.9 dB. Additionally, the input 1-dB gain compression point ( $\text {IP}_{\text {1 dB}}$ ) remains stable between &#8722;27 and &#8722;24.5 dBm throughout the entire 3-dB gain bandwidth.

Many preclinical studies and clinical applications urgently require a portable, high-quality, low-cost, and fast imaging system. Thus, translating advanced image reconstruction algorithms into hardware implementations is highly desired. However, existing iterative PA image reconstructions, although exhibit higher accuracy than the delay-and-sum algorithm, suffer from high computational cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-based hardware architecture for palm-size PA tomography (palm-PAT), aiming at enhancing both the speed and performance of image reconstruction at a much lower system cost. To achieve this, we propose an innovative data reuse method that significantly reduces the consumption of hardware storage resources, achieving a reduction of approximately 75% in hardware storage requirements. We conducted experiments utilizing the FPGA implementation of the algorithm, using phantom, human finger data in vivo and ex vivo breast tumor data to verify the feasibility of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that our proposed architecture can substantially reduce system cost while maintaining high imaging performance. The novel hardware architecture design of the model-based algorithm achieves a speedup of up to approximately 270 times compared to the CPU, while the corresponding energy efficiency ratio is improved by more than 2700 times.</description></item><item><title>DCiROM: A High-Density Fully-Digital Compute-in-Read-Only-Memory Macro for Energy-Efficient Task-Level DNN Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11062902</link><description>Compute-in-memory (CiM) is a promising approach to alleviating the von Neumann memory wall bottleneck in data-intensive tasks. As a candidate to build CiM, static-random-access memory (SRAM) has become popular in accelerating deep neural networks (DNNs) because of its mature fabrication support and high flexibility. However, SRAM-based CiM suffers from low memory density, resulting in frequent weight reloading and increased power consumption during end-to-end inference tasks. Recently, read-only-memory (ROM)-based analog CiM (ACiM) has demonstrated the potential to deploy all DNN weights on-chip by leveraging high-density ROM. It may also achieve encouraging flexibility by exploiting the synergy between a small SRAM and a big ROM. Nevertheless, it faces challenges in achieving high computing density due to limitations in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) performance. Meanwhile, digital CiM (DCiM) improves computing density but incurs significant energy and area overhead due to the adder tree. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the first fully digital and flexible compute-in-read-only-memory (DCiROM) design approach. On the one hand, DCiROM introduces a novel ROM-logic fusion CiM that reduces the CiM area by 51% while maintaining high memory density and computing performance. On the other hand, DCiROM achieves high flexibility with minimal area overhead by proposing two innovative multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) resource-reusing techniques. This work has implemented a DCiROM chip with 3024Kb ResNet-56 parameters using a 65nm CMOS technology. This macro achieves 6.9-29.5x higher normalized FoM (memory density x computing density) than the state-of-the-art CiM works. Additionally, it reduces energy consumption per image inference by 2.9-9.9x compared to SRAM-based CiM works when off-chip access is considered.</description></item><item><title>A Bit-Partitioned Floating-Point 6T SRAM Computing-in-Memory Macro Based on Dual-Edge Time-Domain Structure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11080504</link><description>In the computing-in-memory (CIM) field, floating-point (FP) CIM is afflicted with high computing latency and energy consumption due to the intricate procedures involved in exponent computation and processing.

Fabricated with a 180nm process, this macro exhibits low computational latency and high energy efficiency. A novel FP computing architecture is proposed, which is capable of concurrently executing exponent summation, maximum value finding, difference generation, and mantissa shifting. This architecture effectively reduces the overall delay in exponent computation and processing, thereby enhancing the throughput. Furthermore, a bit-partitioned computing concept and an exponent sparsity scheme are introduced. In this scheme, sparsity judgment is made solely by processing the high 4 bits of the exponent, which significantly reduces power consumption in the remaining exponent computation and processing steps. Additionally, based on the bit-partitioned concept, a dual-edge TD exponent summation and mantissa multiplication-and-accumulation (MAC) circuit is devised. This circuit not only suppresses nonlinear errors during multi-bit computation but also exploits both the rising and falling edges of pulses for computation, thus accelerating the macro&#8217;s operation speed. Compared to previous approaches, an extra 24% power reduction is achieved. At a sparsity level of 90%, a normalized energy efficiency of 14.418 TFLOPS/W and a normalized area efficiency of 0.041 TFLOPS/mm2 are attained. When this work is applied to the ResNet-18 model with BF16 format for input, weight, and output, the accuracy loss on the CIFAR-100 dataset is merely &#8722;0.16%.</description></item><item><title>Booth-Assisted Mixed-Precision Reconfigurable Digital Computing-in-Memory Engine With Ternary-Input 1T2R ReRAM for Edge AI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11128898</link><description>ReRAM has emerged as a promising candidate for computing-in-memory due to its excellent compatibility with advanced CMOS processes, high density, and non-volatility. Meanwhile, Digital Computing-in-Memory (DCIM) offers higher energy efficiency than its analog counterpart and supports full-precision processing. However, existing ReRAM-based DCIMs are hindered by error-prone readout and low input parallelism. The inefficient bit-width reconfiguration also incurs significant hardware overhead during neural network mapping. This paper reports a 64Kb DCIM engine based on 1T2R ReRAM bitcells for multiply-and-Accumulate(MAC) acceleration. The ternary-input Booth-assisted multiply-in-memory (TB-MIM) flow allows bi-state ReRAM with limited readout margin to achieve high-accuracy computation with high parallelism. The corresponding reconfigurable vector adder-tree and accumulator (ReV-A2) effectively facilitate practical hybrid-precision network mapping. Simulations show that the proposed DCIM engine achieves a normalized throughput rate of 284.44 GOPS/Kb and an energy efficiency of 730.16 TOPS/W, surpassing previous ReRAM-based DCIM designs by  $3.3\times $ .</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Column-Wise Multi-Gain HDR CMOS Image Sensor for Single-Shot HDR Imaging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11060573</link><description>This paper presents a novel column-wise multi-gain high dynamic range (HDR) CMOS image sensor (CIS) designed to adapt dynamically to varying illumination conditions. The proposed CIS employs a dual ramp generator and column-parallel gain control to enable two-stage analog gain (AG) adjustments, achieving up to 256 unique column-wise gain patterns. Additionally, this study introduces an innovative image synthesis method, which allows for HDR implementation without any loss of image resolution during the synthesis process. This ensures that the sensor maintains high-resolution imaging quality while adapting dynamically to illumination changes. These innovations allow for fine-grained HDR image synthesis within a single frame, eliminating motion blur and supporting real-time performance in dynamic environments.

However, traditional CIM architectures face challenges such as high resource consumption, especially in data conversion, which can significantly impact chip area and energy efficiency. To address these challenges, this work proposes a computational CIM architecture utilizing multilevel analog memory, named AM-CIM, tailored for near-sensor (NS) computation of real-time KWS applications. Additionally, approximate memory technology is integrated into the AM-CIM architecture, employing data resilience scheduling for analog memory which contributes to significant reductions in hardware overhead. This integration facilitates a hardware-software co-design approach. To deploy KWS tasks in AM-CIM, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network, referred to as MAC-GRU, is implemented. By employing Mel-energy as the input feature at the near-sensor end, the system achieves a 93.13% reduction in feature extraction power consumption. Evaluation results based on TSMC 180-nm technology demonstrate that the AM-CIM architecture achieves an accuracy of 88.51% for 10-keyword classification with a power consumption of  $546~\mu W$ , while reducing analog memory area by 43.32%.</description></item><item><title>MGARoute: Efficient Analog Routing With Multi-Stage Rip-Up and Rerouting Under Geometric and Symmetry Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051139</link><description>Routing is a critical path-planning challenge in integrated circuit (IC) design, especially in analog IC design, where the complexity of the routing problem increases significantly owing to complex constraints and process parameters. Traditional automated routing techniques often rely on manual experience, limiting the effectiveness of the algorithms. To address this limitation, this study proposes a multilevel fast detour and rerouting algorithm based on reinforcement learning that integrates multiple symmetry and geometric constraints. The algorithm can effectively improve the design efficiency and reduce human error while optimizing the circuit performance and power consumption. The results show that the framework significantly improves the routing speed, reduces the number of vias, and is essentially free of DRC reporting errors on a variety of circuits in SMIC&#8217;s 180 nm technology.

However, in real circuits, multiple inputs can switch simultaneously, resulting in a significant speed-up. This discrepancy can lead to circuit failures due to inaccurate early analysis, despite static timing analysis (STA) tools adopting conservative strategies. Consequently, multi-input switching (MIS) models have gained importance for timing libraries. For complex logic gates, however, the number of possible transitions that must be considered for characterization increases significantly, posing a substantial challenge in modeling MIS effects. We propose a novel approach to address this challenge by combining the power of satisfiability (SAT) solvers and machine learning (ML) techniques. First, we perform a logical analysis on the Boolean function of a given logic gate to identify input patterns that can lead to MIS-induced speed-up. This task is formulated as a SAT problem, and a SAT solver is utilized to extract all MIS-relevant transitions, thereby significantly reducing the characterization and modeling effort. Next, we leverage ML techniques to accurately capture the complex dependencies of MIS-induced speed-up under various circuit and environmental conditions. To streamline this process, we introduce an automated tool framework named LiMo (Library Model), which integrates a SAT solver, SPICE simulator, dataset optimization strategies, ML training/testing infrastructure, and multiprocessing capabilities to create MIS-aware timing libraries. The results on benchmark circuits reveal that ignoring MIS effects can result in relative root mean square errors (RRMSE) exceeding 40% in timing attributes. In contrast, LiMo-generated libraries achieve RRMSE errors below 7% compared to SPICE simulations, while delivering results  $\sim 10,000 \times $  faster, underscoring their suitability for incorporating MIS effects in STA for industrial designs.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Hybrid Dynamic Event-Triggered Bipartite Consensus Control for Multi-Agent Systems Against DoS Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048444</link><description>This paper addresses the secure bipartite consensus control problem for multi-agent systems under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. A class of aperiodic time-sequence-based DoS attacks is considered, and its impact on both undirected and directed network topologies is analyzed. The stability analysis is conducted using a Lyapunov function approach combined with an iterative method. To reduce energy consumption and prevent Zeno behavior, a hybrid dynamic event-triggered mechanism is introduced. This mechanism incorporates an improved dynamic event-triggering condition, which determines when each agent updates its control signal and transmits its currently triggered state to neighboring agents. The proposed approach integrates this mechanism with the developed distributed control protocol and to ensure bipartite consensus even in the presence of DoS attacks. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through two simulation examples.</description></item><item><title>Autoencoder-Based Transceivers for Multiple Access Human Body Communication Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11054282</link><description>The Internet of Bodies (IoB) represents a transformative technological innovation that merges the bio-physical and digital realms through networks of intelligent devices positioned in, on, and around the human body. Human Body Communication (HBC) offers a promising method for enabling IoB networks, using the human body as a communication channel for multiple wearable nodes. Despite the prevalence of HBC peer-to-peer communication methods in the literature, the challenge of implementing multiple access techniques for HBC at the physical layer remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a new multiple access HBC (MA-HBC) system that leverages autoencoders to design and implement low-power and efficient transceivers sharing a common channel. The proposed MA-HBC system consists of multiple autoencoder-based transceivers trained jointly to optimize overall network performance. It supports various data rates ranging from 164 kbps to 5.25 Mbps, making it suitable for a wide range of IoB applications. To validate the design, a prototype implementation is presented. Additionally, to ensure suitability for wearable devices, a low-power hardware transceiver architecture is provided with an estimated energy efficiency of 105 pJ/b when implemented using TSMC 65nm LP technology. The results show that the proposed MA-HBC system outperforms traditional IEEE 802.15.6 based transceivers for two users with time Sharing, achieving a 3.9 dB improvement in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at a block error rate of  $10^{-2}$ .</description></item><item><title>Continuous Flow 4096-Point FFT/IFFT Hardware Architecture for 5G Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073142</link><description>This paper presents a high-throughput, low-latency 4096-point FFT/IFFT hardware design tailored for 5G applications.

The desired features of a theoretical framework for DPs are heavily inspired on classical phasor theory: the ability to transform time differential equations into equivalent algebraic complex equations, while maintaining the familiar notions of phasors, magnitudes and phases, and describing instantaneous power by two components, active and reactive power. Current frameworks rely on integral transforms which need approximations and truncations to allow for practical computation and application and do not offer a theory of nonstationary power. Further, the integral transforms are difficult to operate with and are not suitable to transform any generic nonstationary signal due to convergence requirements and frequency resolution challenges. This paper presents a new theoretical framework for DPs, based on differential operators, that offers a natural and efficient framework to transform nonstationary sinusoidal signals into Dynamic Phasors, while also offering a solid theory on nonstationary power extending the conventional well defined active and reactive power definitions.</description></item><item><title>Online Distributed Convex Optimization for Unbalanced Varying Graphs With Delayed Feedback</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11081829</link><description>Feedback signal delays present a common challenge in the online decision-making processes of various real-world systems, such as real-time economic dispatch in power systems. These delays, primarily induced by limited computational capabilities or unknown parameter changes, can significantly hinder the performance or even effectiveness of online decision-making strategies. This study investigates distributed optimization over time-varying unbalanced networks with delayed feedback signals. We propose discrete-time distributed online algorithms for both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems. Each node in the network has access only to its individual time-varying local objective function with a delayed time sequence. At each decision-making step, each node selects the appropriate local online behavior, which depends on the information from its neighbor nodes, towards the minimization of global cumulative cost function value. We demonstrate that sublinear regrets can be ensured as long as the time-varying unbalanced communication networks maintain  $\mathcal {B}$ -strong connectivity. For a general convex or  $\mu $ -strongly convex local objective function, the network regret and individual regret grow as  $\mathcal {O}((\ln (T))^{2})$  and  $\mathcal {O}(\sqrt {T})$ , respectively, and are intrinsically related to the feedback delays and step sizes. To validate the proposed algorithms, numerical studies are carried out on constrained distributed time-varying economic dispatch problems.</description></item><item><title>Constant Voltage Regulation of Delayed Inductive Power Transfer Systems: A Data-Driven Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048450</link><description>This paper delves into the constant voltage output regulation problem for delayed inductive power transfer (IPT) systems with linear matrix inequality region constraints.

A non-singular fast terminal sliding mode technique is employed to guarantee that the tracking error converges within a fixed time. To address system uncertainties and input delays, actor neural networks are designed to estimate the modeling uncertainties and provide compensation, and critic neural networks evaluate execution costs. To further enhance efficiency, a dual-channel event-triggered mechanism is designed, reducing communication overhead through independent dynamic event-triggering strategies for control input and output channels. The stability of the proposed method is rigorously analyzed using the Lyapunov method. Simulation results demonstrate faster convergence, reduced communication costs, and improved frequency stability compared to existing methods.</description></item><item><title>A Symmetrical Impedance Compensation Configuration for Optimized IPT Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11049914</link><description>This paper presents a double-sided Z-configuration-based compensation network for an inductive power transfer (IPT) system for electric vehicles (EVs) with detailed analysis and optimization factors as an alternative to the double-sided LCC configuration.

Ever increasing interface speed has resulted in multi-phase clock distributions (e.g., half-rate, quarter-rate architecture) becoming a reality over single / complementary phase clock distribution for performance reasons. Conventional techniques of clock distribution often involve distributing multi-phase clocks in pairs of complementary clock phases with proper shields around these phases to avoid coupling with other non-complementary clock phases of multi-phase clock distribution. However, these schemes suffer heavily when speeds/datarates and routing length of clock distribution increase. A mutually coupled multi-phase clock distribution scheme is proposed that overcomes signal integrity issues observed in the conventional multi-phase clock distribution scheme. Two schemes, correct by design (CD) and correct by layout (CL) are proposed to boost performance over conventional methods. Mutual coupling is effectively used between N-phase clocks and matched clocks are distributed with minimal/zero power overhead. Implemented in 7nm FinFET technology, the proposed schemes improve clock swings by ~4.75%-8%, random jitter (RJ) by ~4%-10%, rise/fall times by 10%-23% and achieve perfect matching between N phases of the clock.</description></item><item><title>A 31.25 MHz Bandwidth 52.4 dB SNDR VCO-Based ADC With on-Chip Non-Linearity Correction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11054050</link><description>This brief presents a method for correcting nonlinearities in voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) based analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).

However, achieving this promise has remained elusive due to the lack of suitable training algorithms. Analog memory devices exhibit asymmetric and nonlinear switching behavior in addition to device-to-device variation, meaning that most, if not all, of the current off-the-shelf training algorithms cannot achieve good training outcomes. Recently introduced algorithms have attracted limited attention, as they require bi-directionally switching devices of unrealistically high symmetry and precision and are highly sensitive. A new algorithm, chopped TTv2 (c-TTv2), has been introduced, which leverages the chopped technique to address many of these challenges. In this brief, we evaluate the accuracy and the performance of the c-TTv2 algorithm for analog TL using ResNet and Swin-ViT models, pre-trained on the CIFAR10 dataset, on a fine-tuning task using two subsets of the CIFAR100 dataset. We also investigate the robustness of our algorithm to changes in some device and circuit non-idealities, including weight transfer noise, write noise, symmetry point skew, symmetry point variability, pulse update noise, mean pulse response, device-to-device variability, the number of states, output noise, I/O resolution, and the minimum and maximum conductance device-to-device variability. We demonstrate that the c-TTv2 algorithm mostly surpasses the performance of analog/digital training and narrows the performance gap between analog and digital TL while being robust to changes in device and circuit non-idealities.</description></item><item><title>Smart Watchdog for RISC-V: A Novel Spiking Neural Network Approach to Fault Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051055</link><description>Watchdog mechanisms must detect permanent and transient faults with minimal power and area overheads, but their own reliability is vital, as failures can jeopardize system integrity.

As the demand for increased analog bandwidth grows, the commonly used CMOS technology is approaching its limitations. A promising solution is the interleaving of multiple DAC outputs with an analog multiplexer (AMUX) implemented in silicon-germanium technology. In this brief, a behavioral model for 4:1 AMUX ICs is presented, which reduces run times for system-level simulations by several orders of magnitude compared to post-layout IC simulations. The model was fitted using reference data from a 4:1 AMUX layout simulation, employing a stochastic algorithm to autonomously explore the parameter space. This approach demonstrates both faster computation and improved results compared to a brute force algorithm. The results indicate a close match of the reference and the model output, with low overfitting tendency.</description></item><item><title>SVG Configuration Scheme to Enhance Renewable Energy Accommodation Considering Voltage Stability Constraints in Renewable Power Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11078423</link><description>This brief proposes an effective Static Var Generator (SVG) configuration scheme to enhance renewable energy accommodation while considering cost efficiency and voltage stability constraints. First, the multiple renewable short-circuit ratio (MRSCR) is employed as a voltage stability indicator, providing a computationally efficient representation of voltage stability constraints. Subsequently, a double-loop multi-objective optimization framework is developed to generate an optimal SVG configuration scheme. The hierarchical structure consists of: (1) an inner-loop optimal power dispatch model that determines the minimum curtailment of renewable energy under both voltage stability constraints and the SVG configuration provided by the outer loop; (2) an outer-loop multi-objective optimization model that simultaneously minimizes SVG configuration costs and annual renewable energy curtailment to establish the SVG configuration. Experimental validation on the SG-118 test system demonstrates the superiority of the proposed framework. Through a comparative analysis of MRSCR characteristics and renewable energy accommodation levels, this brief presents an innovative SVG configuration methodology that effectively balances voltage stability maintenance with renewable energy integration enhancement.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Phase Fully-Integrated Reconfigurable Switched-Capacitor Converter for Near-Threshold Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079946</link><description>A matrix analysis is proposed to generate all possible topologies of switched-capacitor converters (SCCs) with N flying capacitors.

In this work, we propose DeltaTrack, a hardware-efficient MOT accelerator that significantly reduces redundant computations by dynamically skipping detection in non-key frames.

Accurate prediction of nonlinear distortion is essential for making design trade-offs between output power and network throughput. We use the series form of the characteristic function (ch.f.) method to predict distortion spectra for sparse multi-carrier transmissions. This method results in efficient calculations of individual signal and distortion components. The method is validated both theoretically and practically. Theoretical validation is performed by modeling the signal as a bandpass Gaussian process that is hard limited, and it is shown that the series ch.f. method produces results that are identical with the classical Price&#8217;s theorem. Practical validation is shown by considering an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal with a fragmented spectrum which is then applied to an amplifier driven into compression for which application of Price&#8217;s theorem is difficult, and the predicted output spectrum corroborates laboratory measurements. Part of the computational efficiency is realized in that the nonlinearity can be expressed as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of samples of its forward scattering parameter (i.e., S21) or transconductance function (including AM-PM effects), and distortion contributions of the signal can be expressed as numerical autoconvolutions of the clean spectrum. Signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) can be easily computed and parameterized across variables of interest, such as overdrive level.</description></item><item><title>A 12-MHz GaN-Based DC&#8211;DC Buck Converter Featuring Dual Reverse Conduction Controllers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11215820</link><description>This brief presents a 12-MHz 30V-to-12V GaN-based DC-DC buck converter incorporating a high-efficiency gate driver IC with dual (high-side and low-side) reverse conduction controllers (RCCs).

Traditional pipelining techniques distributing the computation across different on-chip processing units, while effective for throughput, do not address the latency demands posed by modern neural networks with complex interdependencies and extensive operator parallelism. There is a potential in leveraging operator parallelism to enable concurrent execution across multiple processing units, thereby reducing inference latency. However, prioritizing pipelining or parallel execution often necessitates a compromise, where optimizing one performance metric adversely impacts the other. This article introduces Para-Pipe, a hierarchical mapping framework that integrates intra- and interstage operator parallelism within a pipelined architecture. Para-Pipe navigates the tradeoff between throughput and latency by selectively fine-tuning parallelism levels within and across pipeline stages. This strategy can significantly reduce interprocessor communication overhead, significantly improving energy efficiency. Our evaluation demonstrates that Para-Pipe generates multiple Pareto-optimal configurations, achieving a balance between throughput and latency on an Amlogic SoC equipped with ARM big.LITTLE CPUs and GPU, as well as the Black Sesame Technology SoC featuring a deep learning accelerator and two DSPs. More importantly, throughput-optimized configurations under Para-Pipe on Amlogic SoC show an average energy efficiency improvement of 11.0% over purely pipelined strategies and 23.3% relative to nonpipelined parallel execution.</description></item><item><title>Mitigating Computation Errors of In-RRAM Computing Through Network Retraining With IR-Drop and Data Allocation Effects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982297</link><description>In recent years, In-RRAM Computing (IRC) has been a promising technique for deep neural network (DNN) applications. Combined with the proper pruning technique, the cost and energy of DNN computation can be further reduced. However, IRC often suffers from accuracy issues due to the nonideal effects in RRAM arrays, such as the sneak path and IR-drop, as well as its data allocation. To mitigate those nonideal effects, network retraining with extra error injection is often adopted to alleviate the accuracy degradation of IRC designs in the real environment. Conventional random disturbance and equation-based approaches did not consider the data allocation issue, which may incur larger errors for the sparse matrix generated by data pruning techniques. In this article, a fast and accurate IR-drop model is proposed to reflect the data-dependent effects, which is able to offer accurate error injection in the DNN training phase with sparse matrixes. As shown in the experimental results, the proposed simple model is successfully integrated into the network retraining flow with little overhead, which helps to alleviate the computation errors of IRC designs in the real environment.</description></item><item><title>A Sub- 10 &#956;s In-Memory-Search Collision Detection Accelerator Based on RRAM-TCAMs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002546</link><description>Collision detection can account for over 90% of the total calculation time in motion planning, which makes it critical to optimize the collision detection process.

It is powered by ternary content-addressable memories (TCAMs) based on large-scale nonvolatile resistive random-access memory (RRAM) arrays, which not only store a large roadmap on chip, perform look-up table function in a single clock cycle to accelerate collision detection by combining with the unique logic encoding scheme. Importantly, the RRAM-based TCAM eliminates the need for extensive data transfer between memory and computing units during collision detection, leading to significant energy and delay saving. As the pioneering TCAM-based in-memory-search accelerator for collision detection, the structure achieves 210&#8211; $2225\times $  times speedup compared with previous application-specific integrated circuit-based accelerators, and more than 33 $879\times $  times speedup compared with CPU-based collision detection. Such accelerator well exceeds the speed requirement for collision detection (&lt;1 ms), and is suitable for a number of applications, such as robot motion planning in dynamic environment, animation, machining and manufacturing.</description></item><item><title>Denoise on Sensor: A Near-Sensor Compute-in-Memory Macro for Visual Perception Denoising via Concatnation-Eliminating</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11004071</link><description>Noise is one of the most common and significant factors leading to image degradation. In recent years, due to the rapid development of neural networks, the performance of denoising algorithms has seen a substantial improvement. However, state-of-the-art denoising models often entail large-scale models and heavy computational requirements, making deployment challenging. In addition, we have observed that the location of denoisers in the entire image processing pipeline has a significant impact on resource consumption and denoising effectiveness. Deploying the denoiser closer to the image acquisition stage will be more effective in separating noise from the image. In this article, we propose a near-sensor compute-in-memory macro for visual perception denoising (Denoise on Sensor, DoS) along with its corresponding Edge Denoise U-net (EDU) architecture. DoS employs a mixed-signal circuit implementation for neural network inference, offering a notable advantage in terms of high speed and low power consumption compared to FPGA- or GPU-based approaches, making it feasible to deploy denoising tasks at the near-sensor edge. The simulation results show that the energy efficiency of DoS can reach 21.98 TOPS/W, and EDU deployed on DoS can achieve around 30 dB PSNR and 0.83 SSIM on KODAK, BSD300 and SET14 datasets.</description></item><item><title>Synthesis of a CNTFET-Based Ternary Full Adder Using a Carry-Less Ternary Half Adder</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003064</link><description>The full adder (FA) is an essential element within arithmetic units, significantly contributing to their computational efficiency. Contemporary research endeavors are actively exploring optimized FA circuit designs. The integration of carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNTFETs) and multiple-valued logic (MVL) in circuit implementations holds great promise for achieving exceptional performance gains. This article proposes novel complete and partial ternary FA (TFA) architectures utilizing 76 and 55 CNTFETs, respectively, realized through a streamlined design methodology. The design strategically incorporates a proposed carry-less ternary half adder to compute the sum of the primary inputs. The resulting sum output then serves as a control signal in both TFA configurations. The TFA circuits are further implemented utilizing three unary operators, transmission gates, and pass transistor logic. HSPICE simulation results, conducted using Stanford 32-nm CNTFET technology at a  $V_{DD} \; {=} \; 0.9$  V, demonstrate that the proposed complete TFA design outperforms its counterparts with a 24.24% improvement in delay, a 5.81% reduction in power consumption, and a 28.71% decrease in energy consumption. Meanwhile, the proposed partial TFA offers 19.13% faster operation, 14.4% lower power consumption, and 30.74% better energy efficiency. The superiority of the proposed complete TFA is further substantiated through the creation of a three-trit ripple-carry adder.</description></item><item><title>VariPar: Variation-Aware Workload Partitioning in Chiplet-Based DNN Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993501</link><description>Chiplet-based DNN accelerators have been extensively explored to save design and manufacturing costs. Previous works regard all chiplets as identical and employ uniform workload partitioning strategies. These workload partitioning strategies overlook various real-world factors that contribute to remarkable performance variations among chiplets, including manufacturing process variation, thermal condition, physical placement, and power supply condition. When considering these performance variations, a variation-aware workload partitioning can achieve superior performance. This article introduces VariPar, a systematic framework to employ variation-aware partitioning strategy in chiplet-based DNN accelerators. VariPar models performance variations for each chiplet and partition workloads accordingly. VariPar includes a simulator with multifactor variation modeling and a heuristic search engine to generate near-optimal partitioning within a reasonable time. Experiment results show that VariPar achieves  $1.45{\times }$  performance and  $1.82{\times }$  energy efficiency improvement on average when compared to uniform partitioning (UP) strategy.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Interconnect on Ferroelectric FinFET-Based Logic-in-Memory Circuits at 3-nm Technology Node</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11007562</link><description>This study delves into the impact of interconnects on ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) devices, employing ferroelectric materials in the gate stack for nonvolatile memory at the 3-nm technology node. Specifically, the study investigates the impact of interconnect on logic-in-memory (LiM) circuits. As the impact of interconnect become more pronounced at sub-nanometer scales, they are known to have a significant influence on circuit characteristics beyond the intrinsic properties of the components. Leveraging a newly developed path-finding process-design-kit (PDK), encompassing FeFET characteristics and interconnect properties, we explored various circuit configurations, such as full-adder (FA) and ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM). Our investigation revealed that FeFET-based LiM circuits offer advantages in area, propagation delay, and power consumption compared to traditional CMOS-based circuits. While interconnects still influence FeFET-based circuit characteristics, their impact is somewhat tempered in comparison. We meticulously quantified these impacts. The simulation of how the next generation of advanced interconnect processes can further enhance FeFET-based LiM circuit performance was conducted using the PDK. Through this analysis, we proposed guidelines for the layout design of future FeFET-based LiM circuits.</description></item><item><title>An Ultraspeed Middle Voltage and Timing Analyzer With Near-SPICE Accuracy for Charge-Recycling Buses</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994426</link><description>By stacking two data channels between  $V_{DD}$  and  $V_{SS}$ , charge recycling buses (CRBs) halve the voltage swing on interconnects, achieving significant power savings for energy-efficient on-chip data transmission. However, the middle voltage ( $V_{MID}$ ) between the two channels may fluctuate dynamically due to the diversity of input data, which significantly impacts data propagation delay and reliability. Unfortunately, existing SPICE-based simulators do not run fast enough to identify the worst-case  $V_{MID}$  fluctuation and propagation delay, posing great challenges in CRB design. In this article, we present a dedicated CRB Simulator for fast and accurate  $V_{MID}$  and timing analysis. A highly condensed  $V_{MID}$  fluctuation model, which integrates each cycle&#8217;s  $V_{MID}$  changes into a single closed-form formula, is embedded in the simulator to predict  $V_{MID}$  values at clock edges. In addition, a speed-monitoring algorithm is developed to track the continuously changing signal propagation speed under intracycle  $V_{MID}$  fluctuations for accurate delay estimation. Both the  $V_{MID}$  fluctuation model and the delay estimation algorithm involve only a small number of arithmetic operations, thus featuring remarkably low computational complexity. Compared with HSPICE, our CRB Simulator runs &gt; $1.0\times 10^{5} $  times faster on average across various CRB circuits, with a  $V_{MID}$  prediction error of only 1.3 mV and a delay estimation error as low as 0.6%. The significant speed improvement combined with high accuracy makes our CRB Simulator an efficient and reliable solution for  $V_{MID}$  and timing analysis in CRB circuit design.</description></item><item><title>Theseus: Exploring Efficient Wafer-Scale Chip Design for Large Language Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981855</link><description>The emergence of the large language model (LLM) poses an exponential growth of demand for computation throughput, memory capacity, and communication bandwidth. Such a demand growth has significantly surpassed the improvement of corresponding chip designs. With the advancement of fabrication and integration technologies, designers have been developing wafer-scale chips (WSCs) to scale up and exploit the limits of computation density, memory capacity, and communication bandwidth at the level of a single chip. Existing solutions have demonstrated the significant advantages of WSCs over traditional designs, showing potential to effectively support LLM workloads. Despite the benefits, exploring the early-stage design space of WSCs for LLMs is a crucial yet challenging task due to the enormous and complicated design space, time-consuming evaluation methods, and inefficient exploration strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Theseus, an efficient WSC design space exploration framework for LLMs. We construct the design space of WSCs with various constraints considering the unique characteristics of WSCs. We propose efficient evaluation methodologies for large-scale NoC-based WSCs and introduce multifidelity Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore the design space. Evaluation results demonstrate the efficiency of Theseus that the searched Pareto optimal results outperform GPU cluster and existing WSC designs by up to 62.8%/73.7% in performance (with the same or lower power) and 38.6%/42.4% in power consumption (with the same or higher performance) for LLM training, while improving up to  $23.2\times $  and  $15.7\times $  for the performance and power of inference tasks. Furthermore, we conduct case studies to address the design tradeoffs in WSCs and provide insights to facilitate WSC designs for LLMs.</description></item></channel></rss>
