The flying capacitor of the DIH converter is utilized as the energy buffer for the auxiliary stage, which is a low-cost, GaN-based bidirectional buck converter. The main DIH converter delivers the dc load power from the 48 V bus using an average-current-mode-control scheme, while the auxiliary stage regulates the output voltage with an output-capacitor-current (OCC) sensing scheme. The proposed architecture operates with a virtual auxiliary voltage bus with minimal auxiliary capacitance, $C_\text{AUX}$, due to the OCC-sensing scheme. A 40 W prototype has been fabricated to validate the proposed architecture with the virtual bus concept. The prototype achieves a peak efficiency of 93.8% and regulates the output voltage of 1 V within $\pm$50 mV during 20 A load transients with an output capacitance of only 800 &#181;F. Experimental results validate the operation of the virtual bus with $C_\text{AUX}$ = 0.47 &#181;F during 20 A load transients while observing a deviation of 4.7 V on the 12 V auxiliary virtual bus voltage, $V_\text{AUX}$.</description></item><item><title>A Graph and Number Theory Based Description Method and Equivalence Judgment of Power Electronics Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415262</link><description>In the study of power electronics topology, the existing graph structure description methods cannot comprehensively manifest properties of topologies, leading to difficulties in their equivalence judgment.

Therefore, power electronics topology equivalence judgment can be conducted straightforwardly based on graph isomorphism. The proposed method effectively simplifies physical topology descriptions and related equivalence judgment. Case studies demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Design of High-Efficiency Microwatt RF Energy Harvesting System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416376</link><description>A radio frequency energy harvesting (RFEH) system can harvest and utilize radio frequency (RF) energy in the natural environment.

However, the existing ZSL-TLIs bear high conduction loss because of the coupling between the resonance tanks and the main power loops. In order to solve this problem, an improved zero-switching-loss H6 inverter (IZSL-H6) with low conduction loss composed of novel resonance tanks and an H6 inverter has been proposed in this article. The resonance tanks provide zero-current switching (ZCS) for H6 inverter switches, and the auxiliary devices of the resonance tanks are also turned on and off with ZCS. Compared with the existing ZSL-H6, IZSL-H6 reduces conduction loss by avoiding resonant current flow through the main switches during resonant capacitor charging mode and reducing the number of power devices in the main power loops during the freewheeling mode. Resonant parameters design, soft-switching criteria, and common-mode voltage characteristics are discussed. Finally, a 1000-W prototype has been developed to verify the theoretical analysis of the proposed IZSL-H6.</description></item><item><title>Bridgeless Star Power Factor Correction Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423075</link><description>Two-stage bridgeless power factor correction (PFC) architecture is widely used in high-power ac/dc applications. However, the bridgeless PFC front-end of the two-stage architecture often encounters challenges, such as high switching losses in continuous conduction mode (CCM) or high conduction and magnetic losses in critical conduction mode and other soft-switching modes. These challenges limit the overall system's efficiency and power density. This article presents a patent-pending semi-single-stage bridgeless Star PFC architecture. It allows simultaneous soft switching and CCM operation of the front-end bridgeless PFC rectifier, resulting in high-efficiency and high-density ac/dc system design. Simultaneous soft switching and CCM operation of the front-end bridgeless PFC rectifier is made possible by smartly &#8220;borrowing&#8221; the inductor/transformer current from the second-stage dc/dc back-end to create zero-voltage switching (ZVS) conditions for all switches in the PFC front-end. The architecture maintains the operation of the second-stage dc/dc back-end, and enjoys similar control simplicity to that in conventional two-stage PFC architecture. The merits of the proposed architecture are validated through a 240-W GaN-based laboratory prototype, achieving a full-load efficiency of 96.1%. Additionally, it boasts an impressive power density of 50 W/in3 uncased.</description></item><item><title>An FPGA-Based On-the-Fly Reconfigurable Low-Power SHEPWM Inverter With a Compact SiP Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10430438</link><description>This article presents a selective harmonic elimination pulsewidth modulation (PWM) (SHEPWM) full-bridge inverter featuring real-time on-the-fly reconfigurability of output waveform amplitude and frequency using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The inverter is integrated on a compact three-dimensional (3-D) system-in-package using low-temperature cofired ceramics as a substrate, reducing the printed circuit board (PCB) area. Validated through simulations and measurements at $0.12 \,\mathrm{W}$ and $1.2 \,\mathrm{W}$ peak output power, the inverter cancels harmonics up to the 34th order at switching nodes.

The controller clock continuously tracks twice the switching frequency through internal control that employs a primary clock. The system responds to 256x load rise transients within four switching periods using synchronous control to have fine output voltage attributes with a 27 nF-capacitor at output. Zero current switching in &#8804;10 ns is achieved using an active diode (AD). Employment of the AD ensures nonoverlap conduction of the switches in the buck converter. The analog AD-controller operates bias-free and the power consumed by it scales with switching frequency. As the average switching frequency is proportional to load, the losses in the main controller and AD-controller scale with load that improves the efficiency at light load. The system fabricated in 180 nm CMOS technology for 1.2 V output voltage, enhances the state-of-the-art transient response rate in synchronous mode (to 2.6&#8211;657 &#956;A in 812.8 &#956;s) for limiting the voltage droop to 7 mV. Peak efficiency achieved is 94.8% at 788 &#956;W output. Efficiency &gt;80% is obtained for the minimum output power levels of 12.4 &#956;W and 1.75 &#956;W at primary clocks of 1.25 MHz and 1.25/32 MHz, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Mode Full-Bridge/Modified-Stacked- Switches Structured CLLC Resonant Converter for Energy Storage Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433736</link><description>In this article, a new full-bridge/modified-stacked-switches multimode CLLC isolated resonant converter is presented for energy storage applications. In particular, a multimode wide voltage gain control system is proposed, which takes advantage of the topology reconfiguration method in both the inverter and the rectifier blocks in the proposed circuit to regulate the output voltage while preventing the switching frequency from drifting away far from the resonant frequency. The impact of the parasitic elements in the isolated CLLC resonant circuit is also investigated in this article. In addition, a smooth mode transition is provided to avoid any transients caused by a rapid frequency change. The operating principles of the control system is analyzed extensively. Compared with the traditional pulsefrequency modulated resonant converters, the proposed control system attains enhanced efficiency even at extremely low voltage gains while sustaining a nearly consistent high-efficiency profile. Furthermore, it mitigates voltage regulation instability under light loads attributed to parasitic components by constraining the frequency spectrum. The proposed control system presents an appealing solution for high-voltage, high-power energy storage applications that demand a broad range of voltage gains and where the influence of switch RdsON is reduced due to the low current characteristics typical of these applications. Finally, a 500 W 100 V-350 V input, 96 V output prototype has been built to verify the performance of the proposed converter system.</description></item><item><title>Nonisolated Ultra-High Step-Up Quadratic Converter With ZVS Operation and Low Switch Voltage Stress</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433760</link><description>This article proposes a nonisolated quadratic converter with ultra-high voltage conversion ratio. In the presented structure, an auxiliary circuit containing coupled inductors (CIs) and a voltage multiplier cell is integrated with the quadratic converter to obtain higher voltage gain. As a result, voltage stress over switches is reduced significantly and mosfets with low on-resistance can be used to lower the conduction losses. In addition, soft switching performance is achieved by the auxiliary circuit and all switches are turned on and turned off under zero voltage conditions to eliminate the switching and capacitive turn-on losses. Furthermore, the soft switching is load independent and is performed over the entire load variation. Moreover, due to leakage inductances of the CIs, the reverse recovery problem of the output diodes is alleviated. Due to the abovementioned advantages, the converter efficiency is enhanced notably. Also, the converter benefits from continuous input current and common ground between the input and output, which removes any limitation on the converter applications. In this article, the converter operation is investigated comprehensively and in order to validate the theoretical analysis, the experimental results of a 150 W prototype are provided.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Complexity Pure-MOS Sliding-Frequency Semi-Digital Buck DC-DC Converter Based on a Triple-Comparator Structure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10440481</link><description>Based on a triple comparator and several digital modules, a semidigital buck dc&#8211;dc converter is proposed and fabricated in 65-nm CMOS, for SoC power management.

Compared with the basic variable frequency control, an improved variable frequency strategy can reduce the envelope of leakage inductor peak current and reduce the dependence and sensitivity to the load power. More accurate ZVS criteria in view of the magnetizing inductor Lm are proposed. Seven operating modes are adopted and the transition among them is seamless. Three control variables are used in every mode. Wide voltage conversion gain and high-quality grid-side ac current can be obtained without mandatory current-tracking loops.

Conventional interleaved buck converters have been extensively used due to their high-current output and quick response. However, its output ripple in various duty cycles is not acceptable in many modern applications. The low ripple of IBC-CLLC is guaranteed regardless of the duty cycle by using coupled winding and small passive components. For the IBC-CLLC, a multiphase decoupled equivalent circuit is derived with dual aims: to establish a frequency domain model for transient response analysis, and to deduce a single-phase ripple equivalent circuit for ripple calculation and parameters optimization. A laboratory prototype is developed to validate the effectiveness of IBC-CLLC, which has 90% ripple cancellation and less energy storage.</description></item><item><title>Low-Temperature Direct Bonding of Sputtered Nanocrystalline Ag Film for Power Electronic Packaging: Bonding Mechanism, Thermal Characteristics, and Reliability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443533</link><description>Nanocrystalline metal films are emerging as die-attach materials for power electronic packaging owing to their organic-free nature and capacity for low-temperature bonding. In this study, we proposed magnetron-sputtered nanocrystalline Ag (Nano-Ag) film as a die-attach material for power device packaging. Low-temperature direct bonding of Nano-Ag films was achieved at 200 &#176;C in air, utilizing the thermal instability of Nano-Ag. Significant grain growth in Nano-Ag films facilitated the interfacial voids shrinkage, ultimately enabling high-quality bonding of Nano-Ag films.

The thermal resistance (Rth) measurement revealed that the Nano-Ag film die-attach layer exhibited a low Rth of 0.10 K/W, representing a reduction of 37.5% than the Ag nano-paste. Furthermore, the SiC devices using Nano-Ag film as die-attach material showed excellent electronic property and power cycling reliability, achieving a power cycling life of 19&#8201;240 cycles at a temperature swing of 150 &#176;C. These results indicate that this organic-free and dense Nano-Ag film is a promising die-attach material for enhancing the electronic property, thermal performance, and power cycling reliability of power modules.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive-Reset Extended Kalman Filter Method for Subsynchronous Oscillation Monitoring</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433725</link><description>The proliferation of renewable generations significantly in power system increases the severity and possibility of subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs) recently. Monitoring SSOs is critical for setting up control strategies and mitigating SSOs effectively. In many SSO events, the oscillation frequency and magnitude are time-varying, which brings great challenges to SSO monitoring. This article proposes an adaptive-reset extended Kalman filter (AREKF) method for accurate estimation of SSO modes. Two improvements are made to the EKF method. The first one is establishing a four-state SSO signal model for the EKF algorithm to track damping factors of SSO modes. The second one is developing an adaptive-reset method to make the EKF algorithm capable of handling the time-varying SSOs by resetting the covariance matrix adaptively. The threshold in the adaptive-reset criterion is automatically tuned with the M2M4 estimator. The performance of the AREKF method is demonstrated under various conditions and compared with that of conventional KF-based and phase-locked loop-based methods. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method as well as its superiority over conventional approaches. Real-time experiment results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in practical applications.</description></item><item><title>A High Conversion Ratio Converter Based on Tapped-Series Capacitor Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10444032</link><description>A high conversion ratio converter is detailed analyzed in this article.

However, as a new type of power devices, aging/failure mechanisms of such are far less studied than silicon counterparts, making reliability one of the most formidable obstacles towards mass production. To mitigate this, device online condition monitoring is highly desirable, in which dynamic on-resistance, dRON, is popularly employed as an aging precursor. However, continuous and drastic changes of operation condition and switching dynamics make it highly challenging to measure dRON online accurately. To address such, this article introduces an integrated dRON full profile scan and offset calibration approach that allows GaN power devices to be monitored online without interrupting normal operation of device under test (DUT), making it a desirable plug-and-play solution to virtually all GaN-based power circuits.

The analysis reveals that electrochemical corrosion is the primary aging factor, with negligible capacitance reduction until catastrophic failure occurs. Further investigation, including temperature rise results and microstructure evaluation, indicates that the melting of the dielectric film is a crucial precursor to catastrophic failure. Finally, the possible degradation and failure mechanisms for this type of ac filtering capacitors are summarized. The observations provide a new perspective on the possible failure mechanisms and condition monitoring of film capacitors in ac filtering applications.</description></item><item><title>Grounded Thyristor Loop-Based Hybrid MMCs for Valve-Side Single-Phase-to-Ground Faults in Bipolar HVdc Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443523</link><description>The valve-side single-phase-to-ground (SPG) fault is one of the key challenges for the MMC-based bipolar HVdc system.

However, a more or less dispersity of the parallel chip parameters is inevitable, which may lead to the current imbalance. Due to the existence of dynamic threshold voltage drift, the dispersity of the threshold voltage of the parallel devices during the whole life is vital for the long-term reliability. This article aims to investigate how dispersity evolves and how it affects the current sharing. It is found that the threshold voltage dispersity indeed does not keep constant during the operation, but on the opposite, it increases with gate stress time, especially at elevated temperatures. This leads to the deterioration of the current sharing of parallel devices. A boost converter with two devices paralleled was built and tested, which validated that the threshold voltage dispersity and current imbalance ratio increase with stress time. Finally, a classification method is proposed to suppress the increase in threshold voltage dispersity and current imbalance ratio. These findings are believed to be useful to improve the performance of SiC mosfets in parallel applications.</description></item><item><title>Comprehensive Performance Improvement of SRG by Turn-ON Angle Optimization Using Linear Normalized Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10293265</link><description>Starter/generator systems based on switched reluctance generators (SRGs) have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional generators for aircraft and hybrid vehicles. To achieve optimal performance, it is critical to consider both machine performance and voltage quality, which are affected by the turn-on angle. Despite its significance, a lack of systematic analysis in existing literature has made it difficult to optimize both aspects of SRG performance. Therefore, this article investigates the influence of turn-on angle variation on the machine performance, including efficiency and power factor, and voltage quality, based on which a multiobjective optimization method is proposed to obtain the optimal turn-on angle for the overall performance improvement of SRG. What is particularly worth mentioning is that a linear normalized model of SRG is proposed for the first time to analytically express the voltage ripple, which makes the voltage quality evaluation more accurate and simple, and makes the optimized solution easily expanded to SRGs with different parameters. Experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method.</description></item><item><title>Various MPPT Modes and Dynamic Performance of Coupled Inductor Bipolar Multi-Output Converter With no Right Half Plane Zero</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10412684</link><description>This article proposes a coupled inductor bipolar multi-output converter (CI-BMC) and its four different operating modes for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) operations with improved dynamic performance during various transient and environmental conditions.

This hybrid structure utilizes FSBBs to regulate its output voltage by adjusting its duty cycle, handling a small portion of the total power, and providing a fast dynamic response. Meanwhile, the CLLC in the structure operates in a complete resonant state to ensure high system efficiency. By sharing a bridge arm between the FSBB and the CLLC, where one arm from each system serves a similar function, the number of switches utilized is significantly reduced, resulting in higher system efficiency. In addition to the structural improvements, to achieve a higher average system efficiency under different loads, this article presents an efficiency-based parameter design methodology. Furthermore, phase shift, an additional control freedom of FSBB, is employed to further enhance the system's overall efficiency; however, calculating the relationship between efficiency and phase shift can be burdensome, especially in real-time controllers. To address this issue, this article proposes a fitting-model-based maximum efficiency tracking approach to reduce calculation complexity. Ultimately, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design, highlighting its enhanced performance.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Transformer-Based DAB Converter With Controllable Integrated Inductances</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10438883</link><description>A dual-transformer-based dual active bridge (DT DAB) converter is proposed in this article. The proposed DT DAB has a small input current ripple and a wide voltage range because the magnetizing inductances of the dual transformers can be used as the input filter inductances at the same time. In addition, the zero-voltage-switching of all switches in the full load range under a wide range of input voltage variation can be realized. Unlike the previous three-winding-coupled-inductor-based DAB converter, in the proposed DT DAB converter, the magnetizing inductances and leakage inductances can be all integrated into split UI core-based dual transformers and controlled accurately. Moreover, the split UI cores can reduce the layers of PCB windings and a low-profile design can be achieved. Furthermore, to obtain the magnetic integration design with low loss, a systematic design methodology for the planar integration magnetics is introduced to make a tradeoff between efficiency and power density. Finally, the validity of the proposed topology and design is verified by experimental results from a 1-kW laboratory prototype.</description></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Review of Integrated Three-Port DC&#8211;DC Converters With Key Performance Indices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10439655</link><description>Integrated three-port dc&#8211;dc converters (TPCs) exhibit obvious advantages in achieving flexible power flow regulation among photovoltaic (PV) module port, battery port, and load/grid port in distributed PV power generating systems. In the past three to five years, many new TPC schemes have been proposed, exhibiting unique characteristics, including isolation performance, number of components, and efficiency, which cannot be accurately described using traditional TPC classification methods. Moreover, there has been a lack of comparison of key performance indicators for a large number of TPC schemes in previous studies. Therefore, a comprehensive review on circuit topologies and control techniques of TPCs by properly defining key performance indicators becomes essential for converting high fluctuation solar energy into reliable and stable power while maintaining high efficiency and small footprint. This article is just to fill this gap by a comparative analysis and overview of classical and recently reported TPC schemes with key performance indexes. After introducing main operation modes of TPCs during one day, four topological structures of TPCs composed of two or three two-port dc&#8211;dc converters are classified and comparatively analyzed. Four important indexes of TPCs, namely voltage gain, control coupling, soft switching, and high-stress working, are used for a fair and comprehensive performance comparison. The advantages and disadvantages of various TPC schemes are featured, leading to a guidance for the selection of TPCs under different scenarios and valuable suggestions for the future development of TPCs.</description></item><item><title>Prediction-Based MIMO Control of a Multiport Magnetic-Coupled Energy Router</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10440508</link><description>Multiport power converters are important for energy routing in renewable energy applications. Particularly, magnetic-coupled multiport converters are especially advantageous in terms of galvanic isolation and reduced number of magnetic components. They also enable highly integrated and modularized circuit designs. Meanwhile, their multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) nature complicates the control, particularly with a possibly large number of ports for routing purposes. Unlike the existing single-input and single-output (SISO) controls, this article develops a continuous-control-set model predictive control (MPC)-based MIMO control scheme that improves the dynamic performance of the multiport power converters, minimizes interference among different ports, and simplifies the controller design process. The aspects of state-space MIMO modeling, optimization problem definition and solution, and necessary modifications are systematically discussed for practical real-time implementation, especially on low-cost microcontroller units (MCUs). Finally, the developed MPC-based MIMO control is experimentally validated by a prototype eight-port energy router (800 W maximum power) exhibiting superior dynamic responses and a high system efficiency above 94% over a wide power range.</description></item><item><title>Mathematical Modeling and Optimization for the Power Density of the Free-Standing Magnetic Field Energy Harvester</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10444935</link><description>The free-standing magnetic field energy harvester (FSMFEH) offers a potential solution for powering sensors in the power grid. However, designing the FSMFEH through finite element simulations and experiments is time-consuming and difficult to summarize generalized design guidelines. To address this issue, a mathematical model relating the power density to the coil and core parameters is developed in this article. A correction term is introduced to reflect the aggregation of the H-shaped core to the external magnetic field. The experimental results show that the model error is less than 4%. Based on this model, the core geometry, core material, coil turns, and wire radius are optimized to enhance the power density of the FSMFEH. It is found that the coil has a significant impact on the power density, which deviates from previous studies that solely focus on the core volume. The induced voltage of the coil is also considered in the optimization procedure. The optimized FSMFEH attains an output power of 6.33 mW with a magnetic field of 200 &#956;T/50 Hz. Compared to previous studies, the FSMFEH designed in this work can achieve high power and power density with a smaller size and weaker external magnetic field.</description></item><item><title>On the Limitations of the Coupled Mode Theory and Parity-Time Symmetry for Near-Field Wireless Power Transfer Research</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10391278</link><description>The coupled mode theory (CMT) and parity-time (PT) symmetry were recently used in studying wireless power transfer (WPT) systems. This paper re-examines these approaches. The limitations of CMT and PT symmetry are identified and highlighted so that WPT researchers can avoid their pitfalls. Electric circuit theory (ECT) is based on laws of physics and offers exact solutions. CMT is actually derived from ECT through two simplification stages, and it only gives approximate solutions. CMT involves assumptions that neglect high-frequency components in the WPT systems. Therefore, CMT cannot offer more information and better accuracy than ECT for WPT studies. The PT symmetry leads to the zero-phase-angle condition that was well known from previous WPT research based on ECT for minimizing reactive power flow and maximizing efficiency. The limitations of these two approaches are explained in detail and compared with ECT with practical examples. Both theoretical and practical results are included in the comparison. These results show that CMT and PT symmetry have shortcomings arising from their respective underlying assumptions. They do not offer new explanations and insights that ECT cannot offer. ECT is still the most appropriate analytical tool to study near-field WPT systems on the conditions that the dimensions of the circuit components are much smaller than the wavelengths of the operating frequencies.</description></item><item><title>A New Design and Analysis for Metasurface-Based Near-Field Magnetic Wireless Power Transfer for Deep Implants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10400819</link><description>Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a crucial enabler for the long-term powering of existing implantable medical devices (IMDs). This article proposes a new design and analysis methodology for a tunable metasurface (MTS) based near-field magnetic WPT system. A near-field magnetic WPT system using a multi-coil topology creates stable power with a low specific absorption rate. However, maintaining the optimal performance of a system under misalignment conditions continues to be a challenging issue. To address this issue, the proposed design method enables the optimal coupling of the WPT system by tuning the system capacitances at a fixed frequency. Moreover, it is undefined to accurately determine the effective permeability of the MTS in the near-field range. Therefore, based on optimized results, a method is proposed to retrieve effective permeability in near-field scenarios. The effective permeability results are distinct from the typical response of the Lorentz oscillator. As a result, the specific connection between the optimization method and retrieval of effective permeability has been established. The methodology is applied to an exemplified system, where the maximal simulated and measured power transfer efficiencies at an implant depth of 8 cm are 2.32% and 2.60%, respectively. In addition, the planar MTS exhibits a high lateral misalignment tolerance, thereby enabling the development of a reliable WPT system for continuous power supply to IMDs.</description></item><item><title>Memristor Equivalent Model of an Inductive Wireless Power Transfer System Based on the Sigmoid Function</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10411131</link><description>The bridge rectifier with filter circuit is a fundamental component of inductive wireless power transfer (IWPT) and other power electronic systems that accomplish ac&#8211;dc conversion. It belongs to the category of extended memristors. Circuits containing this component may exhibit unconventional dynamical characteristics, such as hidden attractors, coexistence of multiple attractors, multistability, and transient transitions. These characteristics increase system uncertainty. Focusing on IWPT systems with different compensation topologies, this article establishes memristor mathematical models for two types of bridge rectifier circuits, namely C-filtering and LC-filtering, based on the sigmoid function. Taking the S-S type IWPT system as an example, an equivalent memristor circuit model was developed, and the established model was verified through simulations and experiments. The results show that the established model accurately captures the static and dynamic characteristics of a system. The load characteristic of the IWPT system follows a pinched hysteresis loop, aligning with the three memristor features. The established model is concise in form and can uniformly describe the continuous conduction and discontinuous conduction modes. It perfectly models continuous and smooth instantaneous values and offers a suitable tool for analyzing system dynamics.</description></item><item><title>A Front-End Monitoring Method for Coupling Coefficient and Receiver Resonant Frequency in the SS-Compensated Wireless Power Transfer Systems With Unknown Receiver Parameters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415543</link><description>In this article, a front-end monitoring method is proposed to estimate the coupling coefficient and receiver resonant frequency in the series&#8211;series compensated wireless power transfer systems. The proposal requires no prior knowledge of the receiver circuit parameters, such as the self-inductance of the coil, compensated capacitor, load resistance, and resonant frequency. Hence, it is suitable for the development of universal wireless charging systems and is immune against parameter tolerances and aging effects. It uses a sensing coil, which is decoupled from the transmitter coil but coupled with the receiver coil, to detect the phase information of the current on the receiver side. Only one zero-crossing sensor is required to detect the voltage information in the sensing coil. Two frequency sweeping processes are included to find the frequency points where the ac output voltage is in phase or out of phase with the ac input voltage. In the experiment, the estimation errors are less than 4.91% for the coupling coefficients and 1.33% for the receiver resonant frequencies. In addition, the estimation is extremely fast. The estimation time is within 5&#8211;9 ms.</description></item><item><title>Improved H&#8734; Control for Input-Series&#8211;Output-Series Multichannel Inductive Power Transfer System Considering Parameter Inconsistency and Load Perturbation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416756</link><description>To achieve stable output and enhance the robustness of input-series&#8211;output-series multichannel inductive power transfer system under parameter inconsistency and load perturbation, an improved H&#8734; robust control is proposed in this article. First, the control effect of multichannel system is analyzed, which transfers the controller design into single system with uncertainty. Then, a linear model is established based on generalized state space averaged method and the influence of parameter inconsistency and load perturbation is analyzed. After that, the uncertain model is obtained via frequency-domain analysis, generating a numerical solution of weighting function to describe the uncertainty of parameter inconsistency and load perturbation. Based on the proposed weighting function, the improved H&#8734; robust controller is designed and the dynamic performance and robustness of the close-loop system is analyzed. Finally, a down-scale prototype with three channels is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the system obtains good dynamic performance and strong robustness against parameter inconsistency and load perturbation. When load changes between 60 and 80 &#937;, the settling time is less than 4.7 ms with the overshoot being less than 7.3%. Even against large load perturbations, the settling time is still less than 8 ms.</description></item><item><title>Research on Mutual Inductance Identification and Efficiency Optimization of the Three-Coil Wireless Power Transfer Systems With Switchable Relay Coil</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423809</link><description>One of the most difficult problems of the three-coil wireless power transfer (WPT) systems is that the receiving coil is hardly fully aligned with the transmitting and relay coils, which affects the efficiency of the practical system seriously as the coupling exists among the transmitting, relay and receiving coils simultaneously. Therefore, this article presents a new mutual inductance identification and efficiency optimization method for the three-coil WPT system with a switchable relay coil. First, the mathematical model of the three-coil WPT system with and without the relay coil is constructed. Second, the mutual inductance identification method is proposed to analyze the mutual inductances among the three coils by the switchable relay coil, which does not need complicated mathematical calculation strategies and the operating frequency of the system can be held constant. Then the coil-to-coil efficiency of the system is compared with and without the relay coil when the load resistance or position varies. Finally, a coil-to-coil efficiency improvement method is proposed to ensure that the system can always operate under high-efficiency conditions according to the identified mutual inductances of the three-coil WPT system.</description></item><item><title>Optimized Design of Passive Array Coils for High-Efficiency and Anti-Misalignment WPT System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433699</link><description>Mid-range wireless power transfer (WPT) system for consumer electronics has been hamstrung by modest energy efficiencies and low misalignment tolerance. As the increase in transfer distance, the increasing leakage magnetic flux between transmitting coil and receiving will deteriorate the system performance. In this article, a novel optimization-based design method of passive array coils (PACs) is presented in order to maximize the power transfer efficiency (PTE) and improve the misalignment tolerance in WPT system. A modified multiobjective genetic algorithm is implemented to optimize parameters of PACs in consideration of PTE, displacement flexibility and volume of PACs. Moreover, a parameter design scheme for compensation network, namely Series-Seriess-Series topology for co-planar multiple coils is investigated, which can achieve zero phase angle in primary side and enhance power factor. Finally, the reasonable prototype of the proposed WPT system with PACs is designed, fabricated and tested. The experimental results show that the proposed structure can increase the efficiency by almost 50% over the system without PACs at 400 mm distance and deliver almost 40 W of output power. Moreover, the PTE and output power can still remain stable under large lateral misalignment with PACs.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Design of Load-Independent Series Resonant Power Amplifier With Constant Current Output and Its Application for WPT System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10440459</link><description>This article presents an analysis and design of a load-independent (LI) series resonant (SR) power amplifier with constant current (CC) output, along with its application for an MHz wireless power transfer (WPT) system. A novel inverse Class E power amplifier is introduced, which essentially produces a sinusoidal output current even with a low-$Q$ SR filter. Besides, the proposed amplifier achieves zero-current switching and CC output simultaneously, regardless of the load resistance. The LI operation is obtained for a specific set of component values, whose design conditions are clarified analytically in this article. The experiment was carried out with a WPT system incorporating the proposed amplifier as a transmitter and the Class D rectifier as a receiver. Although the input reactance of the Class D rectifier changed against dc-load variations due to the parasitic capacitances, the proposed amplifier showed consistent CC operation by using the low-$Q$ SR filter. Also, the proposed WPT system maintained a low total harmonic distortion of the transmission current over the wide load range, even with the low-$Q$ output filter. The prototype WPT system with the proposed amplifier achieved 88% power-delivery efficiency with 60 W output power at 3.39 MHz transmission frequency. The experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed amplifier.</description></item><item><title>A Simultaneous Wireless Power and Coil Inductance Insensitive Data Transfer System for Rotary Structures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10440478</link><description>This article proposes a simultaneous wireless power and coil inductance-insensitive data transfer system for rotary structures. Power and data are transferred simultaneously via a pair of coupled coils, adopting frequency division multiplexing technology. The data carrier is injected into and extracted from the power transfer channel by inductors connected serially with the coupled coils and by multiplexing the compensation networks of the power transfer channel.

As the spatial position between the coupling structures changes, the system transmission efficiency decreases dramatically, seriously reducing the flexibility of power transfer. To solve this problem and achieve a power transfer with a high degree of freedom in a 3-D space, a novel 3-D coil based on a 26-faced polyhedron is proposed as the transmitting coil winding structure, which is wound using the regular monolithic winding method without overlapping. By means of this coil, it is ensured that the winding direction of each planar coil is different from those of the adjacent planes so that the magnetic fields between adjacent coils are mutually reinforced, thus enhancing the spatial magnetic field density of the system and enabling a stable and efficient transmission of power at any position. The transmitting coil can be enlarged by changing the coil structure, thereby enabling omnidirectional WPT in a larger space. Through experimental research, the system can achieve omnidirectional WPT with an efficiency of 60%, and its transmission efficiency can remain stable within a defined range as the receiver moves.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Three-Phase Transformerless Hybrid Multilevel Inverter for Solar PV Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10213275</link><description>The proposed inverter topology is emerged from the multiple level-doubling-network (LDN) based topology for grid-connected solar photovoltaic (PV) system, where dc buses of three phases could not be merged without electrical isolation.

Aiming at the minimum total harmonic distortion of the grid-side current, the universal guidelines for the optimal CPS angle with the number of rectifiers are proposed. To suppress the low-order harmonics, multiresonance controllers are introduced into the disturbance estimation loop of the ESO, whose output is used for feed-forward compensation. The effectiveness of the strategies is verified by hardware-in-the-loop simulation and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Series Connected Open-End Winding Generator for Higher Voltage DC Supply</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163973</link><description>High-voltage dc is popular for transmission of large volume of power over long distances due to several advantages. Medium voltage dc transmission are becoming de facto standard in offshore wind generation and in similar cases where long cable lengths are required for transmitting power from the source to the usable destination. Several schemes have been proposed for generating the high dc bus voltage from the lower voltage ac generators at the offshore platform. However, size, weight, and maintenance are the major deciding factors. This article proposes a scheme of generating suitable dc voltage from a lower voltage synchronous generator without using transformers or boost converters. It uses an open end winding permanent magnet synchronous generator. The voltage outputs from each winding are converted to boosted dc by individual 1-phase pulsewidth modulation converters, whose dc bus are connected in series to convert to a higher dc bus voltage. This permits conversion to much higher voltage dc employing semiconductor switches of lower voltage rating. Simulation and experimental verification are presented to validate the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Zero-Sequence Component Injection PWM Scheme for Three-Level Neutral Point Clamped Rectifiers With Unbalanced DC-Link Voltages</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185997</link><description>This article investigates the operating characteristics of three-level neutral-point-clamped rectifiers with unbalanced dc-link voltages.

However, one big challenge is the mismatch of overvoltage withstand capability of electromagnetic transformer and converters in the HTs. The limited overvoltage capacity of the converter limits the overall performance of the HT in overvoltage events in the power grid. To address this issue, a novel voltage-clamped submodule (VCS) scheme is proposed for enhancing overvoltage withstand capability of high-voltage HT. The voltage-clamped circuit, which consists of a gap and a metal oxide varistor, ensures the safe operation of the VCS without the risks of breakdown during overvoltage period. Thus, this scheme allows the high-voltage HT to take advantage of the surge resistance of electromagnetic transformers and keep the enhanced controllability normally during transient surges. An experimental platform was built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed VCS, and simulation results demonstrated the usefulness of the high voltage HT with proposed scheme in power delivery systems subjected to different transient surges.</description></item><item><title>A High-Order Harmonic Compound Rotor Based Brushless Dual-Electrical-Port Dual-Mechanical-Port Machine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10195929</link><description>The brushless dual-electrical-port dual-mech- anical-port machine (BLDDM) is increasingly developed as an effective power split device for continuously variable transmission due to its compactness and high control flexibility.

However, the unsuppressed torque ripple of IPMSM will cause declined torque quality, increased vibration, and reduced reliability. This article presents a novel composed T-shaped notching rotor to suppress torque ripple for IPMSM. The mathematical models of cogging torque and winding factors considering T- shaped notches are established, respectively. Although the principle of the novel rotor design is clearly explained by mathematical models, the accurate dimensions of the composed T-shaped notch are difficult to calculate. Therefore, two-dimensional finite element analysis and multiobjective design optimization are employed to calculate the T-shaped notch dimensions. The electromagnetic performance of the proposed rotor machine is compared with that of the commonly notching rotor machine. In addition, the mechanical strength of the novel rotor is verified by calculations of stress and deformation. Finally, the proposed prototype with a novel rotor is fabricated, and extensive experiments are conducted. The results show that the torque ripple of IPMSM can be significantly reduced by the novel composed T-shaped notching rotor.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Highly Efficient Torque-Sharing Algorithm for Dual Stator Winding Induction Machines for Various Speed Regions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10168138</link><description>This article proposes a novel and highly efficient torque-sharing algorithm for dual stator winding induction machines (DSWIMs). This algorithm introduces three modes of operation for DSWIMs based on the command speed and the required load power. Implementing this algorithm makes accurate flux calculation and control possible in very low-speed regions, including zero speed. In higher speed regions, if one of the winding sets is able to supply the required power solely, the other is switched off to augment the overall efficiency. In higher required powers, both winding sets cooperate to supply the load torque, and the required electromagnetic torque division between the two winding sets is fulfilled based on their power ratings. This guarantees overloading avoidance in various operation conditions. Moreover, the optimal flux condition is guaranteed in various speed regions free of the torque sharing. In addition, this algorithm is general and can be implemented in direct torque control and field-oriented control schemes in various reference frames. The proposed algorithm has been experimentally implemented in a 3.3-kW vector-controlled DSWIM drive system. In this flux and speed control system, the flux is controlled such that a search-based maximum torque per ampere (MTPA) algorithm is realized. The proposed MTPA strategy is insensitive to DSWIM parameters and load variations. The experimental results confirm the functionality of the proposed DSWIM drive system in various operation conditions.</description></item><item><title>Online Loss Calculation and Optimization of an M3C-Driven Externally Excited SM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163964</link><description>Pumped hydro storage power plants are a truly renewable solution for large grid-connected energy storage.

The current-source charge pump (CS-CP) PFC converter has the advantages of simple structure, easy control, and low cost, but it can only obtain a high power factor (PF) over a narrow input range. The operation principle of the CS-CP PFC converter and the input voltage range are analyzed in this article. In order to obtain a high PF over a wide input voltage range, in this article, a variable turn ratio CS-CP PFC converter is proposed. By adjusting the turn ratio according to the variation of the input voltage, the proposed converter can obtain a high PF over a wide input voltage range, reduce the voltage stress of the bus capacitor, and solve the problem of insufficient voltage gain at low input voltage. The operating modes and the wide input voltage range of the proposed converter are analyzed, and the relevant parameters are given. A 40-W experimental prototype operating with the input voltage range of 100&#8211;242 Vac is built to verify the theoretical analysis. The proposed converter obtains the PF of 0.946&#8211;0.991 and its total harmonic distortion of current can satisfy the IEC 61000-3-2-2020 Class-C Standard in the whole input voltage.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Capacitor Voltage-Balancing Method for Multiwinding Resonant Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10183679</link><description>Isolated dc/dc converters play a key role in electric vehicle applications, and novel multiwinding resonant converters have recently been proposed for on-board and off-board charging applications. Some of these topologies have two series capacitors at the dc bus with a mid-point connection to the windings. Parameter mismatch due to manufacturing differences will cause voltage unbalance on these capacitors, which can lead to safety and reliability concerns. However, the well-known capacitor balancing strategies proposed for other topologies are not applicable to these new resonant multiwinding topologies. Thus, this article proposes a novel capacitor voltage-balancing method for a resonant multiwinding converter. The method uses a simple table to decide on balancing switching states. Time-domain analysis is performed to quantify the control cycles required, and an adaptive control strategy is proposed. Experimental results with multiple bus capacitor sizes validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Furthermore, use of the proposed method is found to slightly increase efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Automatic Tuning Resonant Capacitor to Fix the Bidirectional Detuning With ZVS in Wireless Power Transfer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190168</link><description>The power transfer efficiency of a wireless power transfer is degraded by mismatch between LC resonant frequency and TX switching frequency. One of the drawbacks of conventional resonance tuning methods is that only increment of capacitor is allowed. Even if some conventional tunings allow both increment and reduction of capacitance, they fail zero-voltage switching (ZVS) at the increment of capacitance, which practically limits their tuning range. To solve the issue, we propose an automatic tuning resonant capacitor (ATRC), which can both increase and decrease the resonant capacitor. The tuning mosfets achieve zero-voltage turn-on (ZVS) both at the capacitor-reduction mode and the capacitor-increment mode. These two (decrement/increment both are possible, and ZVS for both modes) are the advantages compared to conventional autotuning methods. Additionally, low dv/dt turn-off is achieved at capacitor-increasing mode in proposed method. Hence, the delivered power and overall efficiency is improved. The proposed method is suitable for any LC network to solve the detuning problem. A 200 W prototype is fabricated and tested experimentally. The measurement results show that the proposed ATRC can improve the overall PTE by 25%&#8211;63% point when the operating frequency is detuned ranging 75&#8211;125 kHz for 100 kHz nominal LC resonant frequency.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Practical Evaluation of Dimmable Passive Light-Emitting Diode Drivers for Smart Lampposts</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10199135</link><description>Passive light-emitting-diode (LED) drivers have recently been adopted by the lighting industry in street lighting applications due to their high robustness against extreme weather conditions, long lifetime, and high percentage of recyclable components. With the increasing trend of smart lamp posts, there are new requests for dimmable passive street lighting systems. This article presents a novel dimmable technology for passive LED drivers. By adding a switchable parallel capacitor across the input current-limiting inductor, a small freewheeling period between the inductor and capacitor can provide an artificial dead angle, which reduces the power for a passive half-bridge voltage doubler LED driver. The operating principle of this new dimming mechanism is explained, and a full analysis is included. The new dimmable mechanism has been practically confirmed in a 120-W passive LED system. The theoretical and practical results are in good agreement.</description></item><item><title>Simultaneous Wireless Power and Data Transfer System With Single Coil Based on Multifrequency Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10189817</link><description>The existing energy modulation simultaneous wireless power and data transfer (EM-SWPDT) system will cause severe load voltage drop and power efficiency reduction at the data transmitting. Besides, those methods can only achieve simplex communication. To solve these problems, this article proposes a single coil half-duplex communication EM-SWPDT system using a novel multifrequency modulation, which can enhance data transmission performance. By modulating the conduction angle of the converter with desired signal frequency, the steady state and sinusoidal fluctuating states are realized, which compose different data wave, respectively. Because the data transmission relies on frequency information instead of amplitude information, the load voltage drop can be reduced. And the phase-shifting equivalent current model is constructed to evaluate the influence of data transmission on load voltage. Since the data modulation is performed by the converters of wireless power transfer system, additional auxiliary data circuits, such as signal generators and wave trappers are omitted and branch crosstalk is reduced. Therefore, the influence of data transmission on power transmission efficiency is weak. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed EM-SWPDT system with a novel multifrequency modulation is verified by experimental platforms.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Voltage Stiffness Control Technique for a Virtual Oscillator-Based Grid- Forming Controller</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163995</link><description>Voltage stiffness is a vital parameter for grid-forming inverters. With a very high voltage stiffness, an inverter picks up all the reactive power demands of the point of common coupling. In contrast, with a very low voltage stiffness, the inverter does not participate in voltage regulation at all. Hence, any grid-forming controller should be able to control voltage stiffness dynamically. Virtual oscillator-based controllers (VOCs), the latest and most advanced grid-forming controllers, provide all the steady-state functionalities of the conventional droop controllers and, in addition, time-domain synchronization with a connected network. However, existing VOCs cannot control voltage stiffness dynamically. As a result, limiting reactive power output during a higher voltage sag, especially when connected to a weak grid, is challenging for VOCs. The only existing solution for a VOC in such conditions is to enter into current control mode, which leads to ineffective synchronization, output power oscillation, and, finally, inefficient grid-forming operation. Integrating a dynamic voltage stiffness controller inside a VOC is not as straightforward as a droop controller. Because, unlike phasor-based droop controllers, VOCs have time-domain implementation. In this article, we introduce virtual impedance-based dynamic voltage stiffness control technique for VOCs with systematic design procedures and rigorous stability analysis.</description></item><item><title>High-Efficiency Time-Division Multiplexing Modulation Technology for Modular Multiactive Bridge Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10194423</link><description>In this article, a time-division multiplexing (TDM) modulation technology is proposed to enhance the efficiency of modular multiactive bridge (MMAB) converters in multiport power electronic transformers over a wide operating range. The TDM modulation retains the simplicity of single phase-shift (SPS) modulation while achieving efficiency improvement by adopting different structures (i.e., half-bridge and full-bridge) under different operating conditions with dc bias capacitors. However, determining the optimal structure under the same operating condition poses a significant challenge due to the strong coupling among MMAB ports. To address this issue, this article analyzes a dual-active bridge converter to investigate the steady-state characteristics of different structures, including the root-mean-square current and zero-voltage switching. By decomposing the MMAB converter into different transmission branches, the optimal combination structure of half-bridge and full-bridge are selected based on the branch powers, forming a simple and efficient TDM modulation technology. Finally, an experimental prototype of a four-port MMAB converter is established and tested. The results demonstrate that the proposed TDM can increase efficiency up to 19.09% compared to SPS, validating the correctness and effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Efficiency Enhancement for Alkaline Water Electrolyzers Directly Driven by Fluctuating PV Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163951</link><description>Hydrogen production from photovoltaic arrays is a promising way to fully utilize the solar energy and to relieve consumption pressure of the power system. The low-cost and mature alkaline water electrolysis is suitable for large-scale hydrogen production. However, the low-load inefficiency of alkaline water electrolyzers greatly limits their operation range (usually 40%&#8211;100% of rated load). Hence, alkaline water electrolyzers are hard to follow the fluctuating photovoltaic power in full range. Focusing on this problem, this article analyzes the inefficiency mechanism of low-load alkaline water electrolyzers. It is found that through modifying the excitation electric field, the low-load performance of alkaline water electrolyzers can be greatly enhanced. Based on this, an optimal current pulsewidth modulation control strategy and the corresponding prototype converter are proposed to regulate alkaline water electrolyzers directly driven by photovoltaic arrays. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by a 2 Nm3/h commercial alkaline water electrolyzer. Experimental results show that compared to the conventional dc power supply, 1) the maximum efficiency improvement can exceed two times, and 2) the alkaline water electrolyzer can follow the fluctuating photovoltaic power well.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Power Balancing Control Method for Energy Storage DC/DC Parallel Supply System With Low-Frequency Pulsed Load</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10197235</link><description>For the energy storage dc/dc parallel supply system with low-frequency pulsed load, an unbalanced dynamic power distribution problem will occur due to the inconsistent dc inertia of each converter, even resulting in a severe continuous low-frequency power oscillation. For this, a dynamic power balancing control method is proposed to reshape their dc inertia to be consistent and realize dynamic power balancing distribution among multiple converters without low-frequency power oscillation. Meanwhile, by analogy with the rotor swing equation of the synchronous machine, the power&#8211;voltage equivalent model with introducing the dc inertia parameter is established. Afterward, the essential mechanism of power oscillation with a low-frequency pulsed load is revealed. Furthermore, the principle of the proposed control method is clarified, and the control parameters are reasonably designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed control method is verified experimentally.</description></item><item><title>Model Predictive Control for Intersubmodule State-of-Charge Balancing in Cascaded H-Bridge Converter-Based Battery Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10179256</link><description>In the operation of battery energy storage systems based on the cascaded H-bridge converter, it is beneficial to balance the state of charge of batteries in different submodules within the converter phase-arm. This is achieved by distributing the active power among the submodules. Although multiple methods have been proposed for this purpose, they face the challenge of rendering optimal active power distributions that maximize balancing speed while meeting power constraints in the battery energy storage system. To overcome this challenge, a model predictive control scheme is developed in this article. The proposed method is remarkably robust against parametric uncertainties (battery voltage, capacity, etc.), as evidenced by its ability to tolerate a substantial 50% uncertainty in the parameters, resulting in a mere 0.05% steady-state error. Furthermore, because the predictive control can be executed at a low frequency, the computational burden is comparable to other existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Event-Triggered Hybrid Anti-Islanding Protection Scheme Based on Q-Axis Disturbance Injection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190124</link><description>Distributed generators are required to be integrated with sophisticated anti-islanding protection system (AIPS). However, most conventional AIPS fails to detect unintentional islanding event during perfectly matched loading conditions. To overcome this issue, in this article, a hybrid islanding detection algorithm has been proposed based on the rate of change of kinetic energy and root-mean-square value of absolute frequency deviation at the point of common coupling (PCC). The methodology presents a significant contribution prior to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of the disturbance injection mechanism through the q-axis current control loop of the grid-tied inverter. The method activates the disturbance signal injection mechanism only when an unintentional islanding event is suspected based on monitoring certain parameters at the PCC. This mechanism has been proposed to have zero nondetection zone, very fast operation, straightforward implementation, and significantly less impact on the power quality and stability of the power electronics system. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated by conducting 200+ islanding and nonislanding case studies in simulation as well as an experimental platform. The proposed method is robust, accurate, and fast enough to detect an islanding event cleverly with a detection time as small as 120 ms.</description></item><item><title>A Current-Stress-Optimized Design Method for Dual Active Bridge Converters With Improved ZVS Capability Under Wide Output Voltage Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185988</link><description>In dual active bridge (DAB) converters, the current stress seriously impacts the switching losses, and thus is tightly relevant to the efficiency.

The proposed approach utilizes a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) technique to coordinate multiple control objectives. During the offline training stage, each DRL agent supervises a submodule (SM) of the DCSST, and outputs real-time actions based on the received states. Optimal phase-shift ratio combinations are learned using triple phase-shift modulation, and soft actor-critic (SAC) agents optimize the neural network parameters to enhance controller performance. The well-trained agents act as fast surrogate models that provide online control decisions for the DCSST, adapting to variant environmental conditions using only local SM information. The proposed distributed configuration improves redundancy and modularity, facilitating hot-swap experiments. Experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed multiagent SAC algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Impedance Specifications for Stability Design of Grid-Connected DC Distribution Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10195858</link><description>In practical application, it is more expected that the impedance-based stability criteria can provide intuitive system design guidance. However, the existing stability criteria for the complicated systems always aggregate all equipment/subsystem impedances. As a result, it is difficult to determine the port impedance specification that each equipment/subsystem should meet to ensure the system stability and a certain stability margin. In this article, the impedance specifications for the stability design of grid-connected dc distribution power systems are proposed. First, the stability conditions for impedance specification design are presented based on the dc-side subsystem impedance ratio criterion. On this basis, the ac-side admittance specifications and dc-side impedance specifications are proposed to ensure system stability. The former is used to constrain the ac-side admittance of voltage-source converter (VSC), and the latter restricts the dc-side impedance of grid-connected VSC and the input impedance of each converter-based load. The proposed impedance specifications are mainly related to grid impedance, transmission power, dc-bus voltage, two specific frequencies, and the required stability margin. As long as the proposed impedance specifications are met, the whole system must be stable and has sufficient stability margin. Finally, the case studies and experiments validate the proposed impedance specifications.</description></item><item><title>Power Balancing Strategy for Cascaded H-Bridge Inverter in a Grid-Connected Photovoltaic System Under Asymmetrical Operating Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10183673</link><description>Cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter is a well-established technology for photovoltaic systems. Power imbalance occurs in the system because of the environmental dependence of photovoltaic modules, damage and dusting of panels, and the ageing effect. Subsequently, the power handled by H-bridge modules is unequal. As a result of power imbalance, the H-bridge modules carrying higher power are likely to get overmodulated, increasing the distortion in grid current. Due to this, reliability of the system is affected. The ability of existing harmonic compensation techniques to counter this issue is limited to a modulation index of $4/\pi$. In the view of this adversity, a voltage alteration method along with an optimization algorithm is proposed in this article to alleviate the power imbalance issue. The presented simulation and experimental results validate the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Design and Implementation of an Interleaved High Efficiency and High Voltage Gain Converter With Minimum Switch Count for Renewable Energy Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10173751</link><description>This article proposes a new nonisolated, interleaved, high step-up, soft-switching converter for renewable energy applications. The proposed converter is a boost topology designed to have a continuous input current with low ripple.

Using the proposed structure of the components to form the SDLCN, the converters A and B have continuous input current, better efficiency due to lower voltage and current stress, and minimum component count compared to some of the conventional dc&#8211;dc converters. To analyze the controllability of these converters, a switched linear system model is developed for the proposed converters. For better accuracy, the effect of parasitic elements is considered in the model. The controllability is validated by experiments on a 380 V, 50 kHz, and 200 W laboratory prototype. From the switched linear system model, a small-signal model and nominal transfer functions are obtained, and validated experimentally. Using the stability boundary locus technique and Kharitonov's first method, the PI controllers are designed. This technique selects a resilient performance zone for closed-loop converter operation by considering source and load-side disturbances. The developed PI controllers are implemented in the Xilinx System Generator and the closed-loop performance is validated experimentally.</description></item><item><title>Current-Referencing Electrified Synchronous Machine to Emulate a Synchronous Machine via a Voltage-Source Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10203000</link><description>The gradual decrease of the grid inertia in contemporary power grids is one of the significant problems caused by the expansion of renewable energy sources. As the inertia provided by the kinetic energy in the rotating mass of conventional fossil fuel-based synchronous generator decreases, the stability of the grid frequency deteriorates. Virtual synchronous machines (VSMs) that emulate the properties of a conventional synchronous machine through voltage-source inverters have gained attention as a solution to support the grid frequency. In this study, a current-referencing electrified synchronous machine (CURESYM) is proposed as a new control method that allows an inverter to have properties of a conventional synchronous machine. The CURESYM supports grid frequency through the inertial and damping responses. In addition, the CURESYM regulates the current in the synchronous reference frame according to the intended transient response, which is separately determined from the inertial and damping responses. A droop control was also implemented via current references independent of the damping response. The performance of the CURESYM is verified through experiments. Furthermore, the advantages of the CURESYM are examined by comparing with existing VSM topologies.</description></item><item><title>s-Domain Model of Single-Sampling and Multisampling DPWM DC&#8211;DC Converter Based on Discrete-Time Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163961</link><description>This article proposes a general s-domain model of the single-sampling and multisampling digital pulsewidth modulation (DPWM) dc&#8211;dc converter. The proposed model has two main characteristics. First, the PWM delay is modeled by both time delay and state feedback rather than the time delay only. The time delay and state feedback are decided by the type of converters and carriers together. Therefore, the proposed model can explain the different effects of the PWM delay in different converters and carriers. Then, the time delay in the proposed model is decided by the switching frequency rather than the sampling frequency. Therefore, the multisampling cannot reduce the time delay of DPWM, which introduces ripples instead. For different converters and carriers, the influence of the ripple is varying. Therefore, based on the proposed model, the multisampling does not always improve the stability of converters, which is more in line with the actual situation. Compared with existing models, the proposed model reflects the complex effects of the PWM delay more accurately. To demonstrate these advantages intuitively, the stability of basic converters is judged by the proposed method, whose results are compared with existing models and experiment results.</description></item><item><title>Observer-Based Variable Impedance Control Using Moving Horizon Estimation for Robot Machining Thin-Walled Workpieces</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10188400</link><description>Adaptability is one of the most important survival and living abilities in nature and human society, which needs to perceive the environment and regulate self-behaviors.

No insect-scale jumping robots have yet demonstrated accurate trajectory following. Here, we propose a miniature origami omnidirectional jumping robot (Moobot) capable of high-accuracy feedback control of its jumping trajectory. The robot is based on a four-bar origami structure and shape memory alloys. Two strain gauges and an inertial measurement unit were used to control the jumping force and takeoff angle, respectively, and a reliable jumping mechanism and novel supporting leg were designed to improve jumping stability and trajectory accuracy. Unlike typical externally powered miniature robots, we constructed a 5 cm, 6 g untethered prototype. The error and the standard deviation of the jumping distances were both less than 1.5 cm; this represents a significant improvement relative to all previous insect-scale jumping robots. Furthermore, we integrated the yaw control and conducted omnidirectional jumping experiments, showing that Moobot was capable of accurately traversing different platforms from all directions.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Based Anisotropic Vector Hysteresis Model for Rotational Electromagnetic Core Loss</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10188384</link><description>In this article, a model that describes the anisotropic behavior and core loss of electrical steel sheets over a wide range of rotational excitation is developed. Based on the definition of the effective field, the macroscopic anisotropy field is deduced from a weighted average of the magnetocrystalline energy of a single crystal. An anisotropic vector hysteresis model is then proposed by applying the effective field to the energy-based model. Experimental measurements are used to fit and validate the model. Either alternating or rotational measurements with a maximum magnetic flux density 1.55 T under 10 Hz are employed to fit the model parameters and the remaining set of measurements is used for validating the model accuracy. The results show that the model can naturally account for the drop in the rotational losses at high flux densities regardless of whether it is identified from alternating or rotational measurement data. The generality of the model is demonstrated through continuous angle results and modeling of another material.</description></item><item><title>Modulated FCS-MPC Based on Zero-Sequence Component Injection Algorithm and Vector Synthesis Algorithm With NPP Deviation Suppression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10191041</link><description>Conventional finite control set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) for three-phase three-level (3P-3L) converters suffers from cumbersome weighting factor design, variable switching frequency, and performance compromise in neutral point potential (NPP) and current.

However, influenced by noise and mutation information, vibration-based prediction methods remain in the preliminary phase for precise prediction of power transformer. To address this issue, a contrastive adversarial sparse model is proposed to predict the progress of power transformer faults in the early phases. First, a sparse transformer improves the feature extraction ability of the bidirectional recurrent gated network to reduce noise and extracts significant information from original signal. Then, the mutation information is suppressed by a contrastive adversarial method, based on which discrimination layer predicts the power transformer fault. Finally, to constrain the network, a contrastive loss based on feature matching is proposed to learn more extra information distinct from sparse transforms. Datasets are collected using wireless vibration sensors from a 10-kV real power transformer. Under an identical parameter setting, experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms comparison algorithms in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient, symmetric mean absolute percentage error, and mean absolute error. Especially, the RMSE of the proposed model is 0.0242, exceeding the performance of the conventional model in power transformer fault prediction.</description></item><item><title>Leak Detection for Natural Gas Gathering Pipelines Under Multiple Operating Conditions Using RP-1dConvLSTM-AE and Multimodel Decision</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190156</link><description>Real-time leak detection for natural gas gathering pipelines is critical to guarantee the safe transportation of energy in the source of production. Since leak samples are scarce in real pipelines, modeling healthy data becomes one of the mainstream solutions. However, due to the lack of prior knowledge of leaks, more effective feature learning for multivariate time series (MTS) of pipeline data is a prerequisite for reliable leak detection. Moreover, in-service gathering pipelines usually involve multiple operating conditions (MOCs), where the leak characteristics of MOCs could be significantly different. This poses a serious challenge to accurate leak detection. To address the abovementioned problems, we propose a hybrid leak detection method for gathering pipelines under MOCs. First, anomaly processing and long&#8211;short sequence construction are designed to provide high-quality data for leak detection. Then, reconstruction- and prediction-one-dimensional convolutional long short-term memory autoencoder is proposed to enhance the feature learning for MTS. Based on the learned features, a multimodel decision scheme with one-class support vector machine is developed to deal with leak detection under MOCs. Finally, experimental results on supervisory control and data acquisition data obtained from real-world natural gas gathering pipelines demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Combined Model-Based and Data-Driven Fault Diagnosis Scheme for Lithium-Ion Batteries</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10203013</link><description>Diagnosing potential faults is of great importance to ensure reliability of battery management systems. This is because a current or voltage sensor fault often results in an inaccurate state-of-charge estimate. A temperature sensor fault will cause abnormal thermal management. A battery internal resistance (BIR) fault can lead to an increase in energy and power losses, capacity fading, and further degradation of health. In addition, frequent data transmission to fault diagnosis unit will cause a great waste of communication resources. To this end, a combined model-based and data-driven fault diagnosis scheme for lithium-ion batteries is proposed in this article. First, a model-based fault estimation method with sliding mode observer is developed to estimate the voltage, current, and temperature sensor faults. By integrating an adaptive event-triggered mechanism, the communication resource costs are alleviated. Second, a data-driven gap metric approach is presented to detect the BIR fault. By combining the model-based and data-driven strategies, the fault diagnosis logic is put forward to isolate the BIR fault. Finally, several experiments of the single cell and the battery pack are conducted to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the developed method over the existing results.</description></item><item><title>Detecting Intelligent Load Redistribution Attack Based on Power Load Pattern Learning in Cyber-Physical Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190177</link><description>The massive integration of advanced cyber technologies with power grids has expanded the attack surface area of cyber-physical power systems (CPPSs), where timely detection is of paramount importance for their safe and reliable operation. However, most studies on securing CPPS rarely considered resource constraints, resulting in the unsatisfactory performance of security solutions in practical applications. To gain insight into attack behavior in realistic scenarios, this article fully develops the concept of load redistribution (LR) attacks and designs an intelligent version that considers both concealment property and resource limitation. Then, aiming to develop an effective countermeasure, this article provides a novel attack detection method based on power load pattern learning, which consists of a power load predictor and subsequent attack detector, to determine the existence of intelligent LR attacks. Specifically, a multichannel power load predictor based on the SARIMAX model is proposed to capture both temporal and spatial correlations of power load data for accurate prediction. Using augmented features, a dictionary-learning-based attack detector that can handle the class imbalance problem by unsupervised learning is capable to detect the intelligent LR attacks. Finally, experiments on numerical simulation and the CPPS-HITL platform are conducted to verify the effectiveness and practical availability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive-Optimization-Based Digital Simulation Database for Nonuniform Aging Diagnosis of Transformer Insulation System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10196011</link><description>The trend toward intellectualization is pervasive in the field of power equipment fault diagnosis. However, due to the sample database's limitations, intelligent diagnosis of transformer insulation aging states near the internal hotspot regions remains a challenge. To address this issue, an optimization-design-based simulation model is proposed for the development of a frequency domain spectroscopy (FDS) database for diagnosing nonuniform aging states of power transformer. The simulation model is developed in the current work using distributed relaxation circuits and fast Fourier transforms, and the electric parameters used are identified using adaptive iteration particle swarm optimization. Finally, verification established that the extended simulation model was capable of simulating the FDS of a system with nonuniformly assigned aging states. In this regard, the contribution will aid in the establishment of a trustworthy FDS database for the purpose of advancing intelligent diagnosis of the aging state of transformer oil&#8211;paper insulation at hotspots.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Multiband Rectifier System for Stabilized Wireless Energy Harvesting at Flexible Distances and Dynamic Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10209271</link><description>The unpredictable propagation of ambient radio frequency (RF) waves may cause significant randomness in power densities against the propagation distance, time, and locations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel adaptive rectifier system with stabilized output dc power against dynamic power densities. A novel detection circuit is designed to identify the frequency range and receiving power level. Then the received RF power is amplified to the saturated level by referring to the detected frequency and power information for adaptive dc biasing control for an integrated power amplifier. Doing so makes the input power to the rectifier constant regardless of the power and frequency variations. The experimentally validated system can output a stabilized power under the time-varying power range of &#8722;10 to 0 dBm and location varying within 0.5 m at 1.8, 2.1, and 2.6 GHz. Compared with conventional designs, this system has realized stabilized and enhanced conversion efficiency (61% at 1.8 GHz, 64% at 2.1 GHz, and 53% at 2.6 GHz) and therefore could be adopted for wireless powering distributed sensors and Internet of Thing (IoT) devices continuously and steadily at flexible conditions.</description></item><item><title>Incentivized Coordinated Heat-Electricity-Gas Dispatch: A Zero Knowledge Proof-Based Solution Considering Privacy and Anti-Forgery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10183368</link><description>The coordination of multienergy systems has been commonly adopted to improve energy utilization performance. Reallocating profits of all systems is utilized to provide incentives for the coordination. However, some systems might forge their profits to maliciously obtain more reallocated profits. Existing works partially solve this problem by developing privacy-preserving anti-forgery methods that focus on the coordination of two energy systems with linear constraints. This article proposes a coordinated heat-electricity-gas dispatch mechanism that addresses incentive, privacy and anti-forgery issues. The coordination model based on Nash bargaining is decomposed into both a dispatch problem that maximizes the total profit and a profit reallocation problem that provides incentives. The profit reallocation problem is solved using exponential ElGamal encryption to avoid leaking the profit variation of each system before and after coordination. Furthermore, to prevent any system from forging its profit for maliciously obtaining more reallocated profit, we propose a privacy-preserving anti-forgery method based on zero knowledge proof. The method enables each system to prove that its profit variation satisfies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the dispatch problem with nonlinear constraints. The numerical tests show that our proposed method provides incentives for coordination and detects forgery of profit variation without leaking privacy.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Privacy-Preserving Secondary Control for DC Microgrids via State Decomposition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10207776</link><description>In this article, a distributed secondary controller is proposed for an islanded DC microgrid to preserve privacy information of the local power sources, while achieving current sharing among the generators and voltage regulation of the DC bus. Based on the state decomposition mechanism, the original secondary control signal of each generator is decomposed into two parts: one takes over the role of communicating with neighbors, while the other affects the evolution of the former one and is invisible to the neighbors. Besides, random noises are introduced to mask the true value of the transmitted signals. Under the proposed controller, the current data of the local generators can be kept confidential, as well as the associated privacy power information. In this way, the power security risks caused by privacy information leakage can be avoided. Lastly, both simulation and experiment tests are imposed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Reactive Current Optimization Based Onshore AC Fault Ride-Through Strategy for MMC-HVDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10207701</link><description>Onshore AC faults may cause the modular multilevel converter based high voltage direct current integrated offshore wind farms (MMC-HVDC-OWF) to develop surplus power and trigger overvoltage problems. This article proposes a dynamic reactive current optimization (DRO) strategy that combines MMC energy control capability with transient overload capability to achieve onshore AC fault ride-through (ACFRT). Firstly, the decoupling control mechanism and constraints of the active and reactive currents of the onshore gird-side MMC (GSMMC) are analyzed. Furthermore, a dynamic reactive current optimization based ACFRT strategy is proposed based on the current constraints and the energy control capability of MMCs. The main parameters of DRO are set according to the fault characteristic analysis results. Once a fault occurs, the proposed DRO based ACFRT strategy can control the offshore surplus power by controlling the MMC internal sub-module energy. The DRO strategy quickly optimizes the active and reactive power output commands of the GSMMC by collecting and comparing the local power signals. It enables to increase the onshore AC grid voltage and the transient active power output of the MMC-HVDC-OWF. Finally, The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified through comprehensive case studies conducted on the PSCAD/EMTDC.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive PI Control of Wave Energy Converters With Force and Motion Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10207822</link><description>This article presents the application of adaptive PI control design to a point absorber - wave energy converter (WEC) under force and motion constraints. Adaptive PI control has several features that make it attractive for WEC system. In particular, it has a clear physical interpretation. The &#8220;P&#8221; component converts the wave energy into useful energy, while the &#8220;I&#8221; component changes the WEC system natural frequency allowing the absorber to be more in phase with the incoming waves. However, standard adaptive PI control schemes in the literature do not have the ability to incorporate the constraints in the design phase. The main objective of this article is to fill this gap by proposing a new adaptive PI control law that can take the constraints into account. Simulation results show that the new control law can improve the performance while respecting system limitations.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Optimization of Photovoltaic Power With Lifted Linear Decision Rule for Distribution System Voltage Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214028</link><description>This article proposes a lifted linear decision rule (LLDR) as a photovoltaic (PV) power control strategy for distribution system voltage regulation. First, the active-reactive power control is designed as a linear function in a lifted space of PV power, which is presented as a piecewise linear function without auxiliary integer variables for benefiting the parameter optimization of control functions. Then, a hierarchical central-local voltage regulation framework is designed. In the central control stage, the constant part of LLDR determines the reactive power of PV units, which is also coordinated with other voltage regulation devices. In the local control stage, the adjustable part of LLDR would control the PV power in real time for reducing voltage deviations. Finally, optimization problems and their solution methods are developed to obtain LLDR parameters. In particular, robust optimization (RO) and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems are designed to obtain the affine coefficients of LLDR considering multiple PV power uncertainty models. The tractable formula of RO is derived based on the convex hull of PV power uncertainty sets in the lifted space, and Benders decomposition is combined with a distribution separation method to solve the DRO problem. The proposed method is tested on distribution systems with actual PV power data, and the results are compared with those of other linear and piecewise-linear control methods to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in diminishing voltage deviations caused by variable PV power.</description></item><item><title>Active Fault Current Limitation for VSC-MTDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farms Participating in Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10218998</link><description>The onshore local grid is facing the challenge to avoid continuously increasing fault current caused by frequency regulation (FR) of broad-scale offshore wind farms (OWFs) integrated by voltage source converter based multi-terminal high voltage direct current (VSC-MTDC) system. To tackle this challenge, an active fault current limitation (AFCL) method is proposed in four aspects: 1) a fault current contribution factor (FCCF) is introduced for grid side VSC (GSVSC) to quantify the incremental degree of fault current caused by FR of GSVSC under different fault types; 2) a current phase angle control (CPAC) strategy based on vector analysis is conducted for GSVSC to actively mitigate the fault current increment; 3) according to FCCF and CPAC, an active and reactive current quantification (ARCQ) strategy is developed for GSVSC to satisfy bilateral demands of AFCL and FR; 4) an adaptive frequency regulation (AFR) strategy, which considers FCCF and the operating conditions of the offshore system (e.g., rotor speed and DC voltage), is formulated for OWFs to quantify and generate the active power required for FR and AFCL. Numerous test results are analyzed to verify the effectiveness and performance of the proposed AFCL method in satisfying system fault current limitation during FR of OWFs.</description></item><item><title>Uncertainty-Aware Procurement of Flexibilities for Electrical Grid Operational Planning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10221712</link><description>In the power system decarbonization roadmap, novel grid management tools and market mechanisms are fundamental to solving technical problems concerning renewable energy forecast uncertainty. This work proposes a predictive algorithm for procurement of grid flexibility by the system operator (SO), which combines the SO flexible assets with active and reactive power short-term flexibility markets. The goal is to reduce the cognitive load of the human operator when analyzing multiple flexibility options and trajectories for the forecasted load/RES and create a human-in-the-loop approach for balancing risk, stakes, and cost. This work also formulates the decision problem into several steps where the operator must decide to book flexibility now or wait for the next forecast update (time-to-decide method), considering that flexibility (availability) price may increase with a lower notification time. Numerical results obtained for a public MV grid (Oberrhein) show that the time-to-decide method improves up to 22% a performance indicator related to a cost-loss matrix, compared to the option of booking the flexibility now at a lower price and without waiting for a forecast update.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Negative-Emission Optimal Energy Scheduling for Off-Grid Integrated Electricity-Heat Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10224346</link><description>This article proposes a distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) negative-emission optimal energy scheduling scheme for the off-grid integrated electricity-heat microgrid (IEHM). A negative-emission operating strategy is designed to regulate the electric power, thermal power, and carbon emission of the off-grid IEHM under uncertainty. The post-combustion carbon capture system (PCCS) and direct air capture (DAC) modeling consider both electric and thermal energy consumption. Besides, the duration of DAC process flow is considered in its model. In the DRCC energy scheduling model for the off-grid IEHM, the negative emission is achieved by scheduling PCCS and DAC, and the negative emission constraint is included considering the uncertainty of carbon emission. The uncertain forecasting errors of wind power are balanced by coordinating the combined heat and power unit and battery storage. DRCC approach under the moment-based ambiguity set is employed to tackle both uncertainties. The DRCC energy scheduling model is reformulated as a tractable mixed-integer second-order cone programming. Evaluation indices are defined from three aspects, i.e., carbon emission, economy, and reserve capacity, to assess the overall performance of the DRCC energy scheduling scheme for the off-grid IEHM. Case studies were carried out on two test systems to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Simulation results demonstrate that the off-grid IEHM can achieve negative emission operation while minimizing the energy cost under wind power and carbon emission uncertainty.</description></item><item><title>Combined Heat and Power Dispatch Against Cold Waves Utilizing Responsive Internet Data Centers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10224307</link><description>The extreme weather disaster is a main threat to the operation of integrated electricity and heat systems (IEHSs), particularly the cold wave, which is prone to cause surges in regional demand for heat and electricity. In IEHSs, Internet data centers (IDCs) consume a huge amount of electricity and generate waste heat. The former can be regulated spatially by migrating workloads in the interconnected data network and interrupted temporally with the equipped backup generators or uninterruptible power supply (UPS), the latter can be captured and supplied to the districts using heat pump facilities. Thus, energy behaviors of IDCs are impressively responsive, which are completely considered and dispatched to enhance the resilience of IEHSs against cold waves in this paper. Firstly, the integrated energy response (IER) meaning responsive electricity consumption and heat production of IDCs is modelled considering workload scheduling and emergency standby power supply. Secondly, the adverse impacts of cold waves on IEHS operation are comprehensively formulated using intervals considering both component outages and sudden energy demand increases. Moreover, a scenario-based stochastic optimization model with interval parameters is constructed incorporating IER formulations, in which both unit commitment plan of IEHSs and IER strategies of IDCs are simultaneously optimized. Furthermore, a two-stage stochastic-interval solution method is proposed to handle the hybrid heterogeneous uncertainties in the model based on the L-shaped algorithm and interval linear programming theory. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques using a test IEHS composed of IEEE 118-bus system, seven 32-node heating systems, and eight IDCs.</description></item><item><title>Joint Optimization of Production and Maintenance in Offshore Wind Farms: Balancing the Short- and Long-Term Needs of Wind Energy Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229237</link><description>The rapid increase in scale and sophistication of offshore wind (OSW) farms poses a critical challenge related to the cost-effective operation and management of wind energy assets. A defining characteristic of this challenge is the economic trade-off between two concomitant processes: power production (the primary driver of short-term revenues), and asset degradation (the main determinant of long-term expenses). Traditionally, approaches to optimize production and maintenance in wind farms have been conducted in isolation. In this article, we conjecture that a joint optimization of those two processes, achieved by rigorously modeling their short- and long-term dependencies, can unlock significant economic benefits for wind farm operators. In specific, we propose a decision-theoretic framework, rooted in stochastic optimization, which seeks a sensible balance of how wind loads are leveraged to harness short-term electricity generation revenues, versus alleviated to hedge against longer-term maintenance expenses. Extensive numerical experiments using real-world data confirm the superior performance of our approach, in terms of several operational performance metrics, relative to methods that tackle the two problems in isolation.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Data Center Energy Management With Hybrid Quantum-Classical Multi-Cuts Benders' Decomposition Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10232912</link><description>The flourishing of the data era has led to a higher demand for hyper-scale data centers, resulting in a great energy gap. It is necessary to comprehensively analyze the energy management in data centers to minimize the operation cost. In this article, we first propose a new optimal energy management model for data centers by considering energy consumers such as heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), server, solar, and battery. Then, inspired by the great computation power of quantum computing techniques, we propose a new hybrid quantum-classical multi-cuts Benders' decomposition algorithm, which utilizes quantum advantages in parallel computing for generating multi-cuts in a single iteration. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the novel model and algorithms.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Stage Stochastic Unit Commitment With Mixed-Integer Recourses for Nuclear Power Plants to Accommodate Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243161</link><description>To provide flexibilities for peak regulations in power systems while addressing renewable energy uncertainties, this article proposes a two-stage stochastic unit commitment model with peak regulation constraints of nuclear power plants (NPPs) under the &#8220;12-3-6-3&#8221; mode. The first stage aims to determine the optimal thermal unit commitment, and the second stage tries to adjust the operation modes of an NPP and thermal unit generation output to cope with different renewable energy scenarios. Due to the discrete adjustments of NPPs, the proposed model is mathematically a two-stage stochastic optimization with mixed-integer recourses. Furthermore, a Fenchel cut based bilevel decomposition is proposed to solve this model, where the inner second-stage subproblem is first relaxed into a linear program and a Fenchel cut is then generated to recover the facet of the convex hull solution. The technique can significantly accelerate the computational speed of the proposed model with a special mathematical structure. Numerical results on a provincial power system verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and method.</description></item><item><title>Sky-Image-Derived Deep Decomposition for Ultra-Short-Term Photovoltaic Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246013</link><description>Because of the stochastic and nonstationary weather changes, photovoltaic (PV) power exhibits high uncertainty and fluctuation, which severely challenges the operation of power systems. PV variations can be detected by investigating inherent properties and reflections of sky images. However, limited study has focused on the effect of sky image changes on PV inherent properties. Therefore, in this study, a novel sky-image-derived decomposition method was proposed for ultra-short-term PV power forecasting. First, historical PV series were decomposed into seasonal and trend parts with guidance of sky image sequence. The Auto-Correlation mechanism was adopted to enhance the temporal dependencies of seasonal parts. Then, to reduce the model instability in different weather scenarios, the latent features were handled by an improved density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise using a semi-supervised strategy to identify forecasting scenarios. Finally, a rolling scenario-wise decoder was proposed to conduct multi-step forecasting task. The proposed method was compared with various state-of-the-art methods, including empirical mode decomposition and deep decomposition methods. The results validated the high performance of the proposed method in terms of accuracy within forecast horizons of 5 to 30 min.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Management of Hybrid Energy Station Under Exogenous-Endogenous Uncertainties and Bounded Rationality</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10252038</link><description>Hybrid energy station (HES) systems coupling diverse energy sectors can facilitate the low-carbon and sustainable transition by integrating massive wind-solar power and energy conversion technologies. With the proliferation of renewable and flexible demand response (DR), different uncertainties are inevitably introduced into energy systems because of external volatile surroundings and internal consumers' mutable behavior. Moreover, the probability distribution function (PDF) of these uncertainties may be unavailable or ambiguous and even affected by decisions. In this work, we propose a hierarchical optimal framework for HES systems, in which the energy hub plant determines the schedules of generation and trade in different markets (upper-level) and users minimize energy expense by managing facilities operations considering decision-dependent uncertainties (lower-level). A scheme of energy transaction options is also provided under the bounded rationality of user sides. To tackle problems with uncertain PDFs, a tailored chance-constrained distributionally robust method is implemented. In the process, the correlation DR operation pattern and analytic pricing formulation are derived incorporating the property of users. Case studies with comparison tests validate the efficacy of the proposed model in handling uncertainties and pursuing economic profits.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Service Restoration of Distribution Networks With Volt-Var Devices, Distributed Energy Resources, and Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251925</link><description>The new energy resources in distribution systems have led researchers to consider the operation of such elements during service restoration. Hence, the current state-of-the-art regarding the restoration problem considers the operation of distributed resources in both island and grid-connected modes. Few articles also address the system's restoration capacity changes throughout the time needed to repair the network after an outage, given the variations in the system's demand and availability of energy sources. However, the solutions proposed in the literature converge in proposing a single topology that is feasible throughout the entire repairing time. In this article, we propose addressing the mutable nature of the system's restoration capacity by splitting the repairing time into several time intervals and associating each of them with a specific configuration that minimizes the out-of-service load. Energy storage systems, intermittent and dispatchable generators, and voltage-control devices are also considered. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). The model and its scalability are tested using the 53-, 217-, and 404-node systems, considering different fault scenarios and reliability indices. The results show that the nonsupplied energy during the repairing time decreases when dynamic changes in the system topology are considered. Furthermore, the effects of storage systems operation and their integration with dynamic topology changes are highlighted.</description></item><item><title>Coordinating Multi-Energy Microgrids for Integrated Energy System Resilience: A Multi-Task Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10255302</link><description>High-impact and low-probability events have occurred more frequently than before, which can seriously damage energy supply infrastructures. As localized small energy systems, multi-energy microgrids (MEMGs) can provide a viable solution for the system-wise load restoration of integrated energy systems (IESs), due to their enhanced flexibility and controllability. However, existing literature tends to realize MEMGs as corrective response rather than load restoration resource after extreme events, which cannot fully exploit the benefits of multi-MEMGs on IES resilience. This article introduces a decentralized operating paradigm for the real-time coordination of local multi-MEMGs towards system-wise IES load restoration, while a novel topology-aware multi-task reinforcement learning method with soft modularization is proposed to solve it. The multi-task learning framework enables MEMGs to simultaneously learn scheduling decisions across different network topologies and better adapt to unanticipated contingencies. Additionally, to avoid insecure MEMG operations, a physics-informed safety layer is embedded on top of the multi-task learning framework for action corrections. Case studies have been conducted on two IESs (33-bus power, 20-node gas, and 20-node heat network as well as 69-bus power, 40-node gas, and 62-node heat network) to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enabling effective coordination among multi-MEMGs towards system-wise IES load restoration.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Inertia Scheduling (VIS) for Real-Time Economic Dispatch of IBR-Penetrated Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10264213</link><description>A new concept called virtual inertia scheduling (VIS) is proposed to efficiently handle the increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) in power systems. VIS is an inertia management framework that targets security-constrained and economy-oriented inertia scheduling and generation dispatch with a large scale of renewable generations. Specifically, it determines the appropriate power setpoint and reserved capacity of synchronous generators and IBRs, as well as the control modes and control parameters of IBRs to provide secure and cost-effective inertia support. First, a uniform system model is employed to quantify the frequency dynamics of IBR-penetrated power systems after disturbances. Leveraging this model, the s-domain and time-domain analytical responses of IBRs with inertia support capability are derived. Then, VIS-based real-time economic dispatch (VIS-RTED) is formulated to minimize generation and reserve costs, with full consideration of dynamic frequency constraints and the derived inertia support reserve constraints. The virtual inertia and damping of IBRs are formulated as decision variables. A deep learning-assisted linearization approach is further employed to address the non-linearity of dynamic constraints. Finally, VIS-RTED is demonstrated on a two-machine system and a modified IEEE 39-bus system. A full-order time-domain simulation is performed to verify the scheduling results.</description></item><item><title>Proactive Scheduling of Mixed Energy Resources At Different Grid Levels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10265110</link><description>The optimal utilisation of distribution grids requires the proactive management of volatilities caused by mixed energy resources installed into different grid levels, such as buildings, energy communities (ECs) and substations. In this context, proactive control based on predictions for energy demand and generation is applied. The mitigation of conflicts between the stakeholders' objectives is the main challenge for the control of centralized and distributed energy resources. In this article, a bi-level approach is proposed for the control of stationary battery energy storage systems (SBES) supporting the local distribution system operator (DSO) at the transformer level, as well as distributed energy resources (DERs) operated by end customers, i.e., EC-members. Model predictive control (MPC)-based and hybrid approaches merging rule- and MPC-based control schemes are evaluated. Simulation studies based on a typical European low voltage (LV) feeder topology yield the performance assessment in terms of technical and economic criteria. The results show an advantage of hybrid approaches with respect to the DSO's cost savings from peak shaving. From the EC's perspective, both hybrid and MPC-based schemes can achieve effective cost savings from proactive energy management.</description></item><item><title>An Anti-Windup Mechanism for State Constrained Linear Control of Wave Energy Conversion Systems: Design, Synthesis, and Experimental Assessment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266789</link><description>Motivated by the necessity of suitable state constraint mechanisms within linear time-invariant (LTI) energy-maximising control of wave energy converters (WECs), we present, in this article, an anti-windup (AW) scheme for state constraint satisfaction, where the associated unconstrained controller is designed via impedance-matching theory for WEC systems. As in the standard (input) AW scenario, the adopted technique provides a mechanism for &#8216;informing&#8217; the (unconstrained) controller when constraints are active, so that appropriate modifications to future control actions can be taken accordingly. The overall adopted AW technique is tested experimentally, on a prototype of the Wavestar WEC system, available at Aalborg University (Denmark). We explicitly demonstrate that the proposed AW scheme is able to consistently respect the defined state constraints, having a mild impact on overall energy absorption performance when compared to its unconstrained counterpart.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Estimation of Optimal Prediction Intervals for Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268627</link><description>Accurate and reliable wind power forecasting is crucial for efficient operation in a power system. Due to the substantial uncertainties associated with wind generation, probabilistic interval forecasting offers a distinct approach for assessing and quantifying the potential impacts and risks that may arise from the integration of wind energy into a power system. This article proposes a novel multi-objective lower upper bound estimation method to directly construct optimal wind power intervals without the assumption of any specific distribution function. Prediction intervals at a nominal confidence level are formulated through simultaneously optimizing the Winkler loss and coverage probability. The proposed framework is gradient descent-enabled and therefore allows flexible integration of various deep learning algorithms. An evaluation using four wind power datasets is conducted, and the results are analyzed and compared with those from several benchmark models. The findings indicate the proposed method outperforms its counterparts in terms of both reliability and overall performance.</description></item><item><title>Collaborative Response of Data Center Coupled With Hydrogen Storage System for Renewable Energy Absorption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269736</link><description>The demand response of data center is considered as an effective flexible method to absorb excessive renewable energy (RE) in the power system, especially for the data center with high-density hydrogen storages. Therefore, this article proposes a collaborative response framework considering regulations of data workload and hydrogen storage. It is expected to further improve the data center flexibility. However, this collaborative response is a high-order and non-convex optimization problem involving the multi-period and complex model. Considering the condition of uncertain RE supply, it is difficult for power optimization dispatch to realize the precise decision in this NP-hard problem. To address this issue, a global interval optimization (GIO) approach is developed. It is to obtain efficient and robust decisions in the collaborative response. This approach deduces an interval optimization model to achieve the global optimality of convergent solution. Furthermore, this article introduces a probability correction into the GIO approach. It is used for improving the decision accuracy in the actual renewable power scenarios. A case study based on the IEEE 24-bus system verifies superiority of the GIO approach. It further validates effectiveness of the collaborative response framework for RE utilization.</description></item><item><title>A Regulation Method Considering Coupled Voltage Violation and Unbalance in Three-Phase Four-Wire Hybrid AC/DC LVDNs With High Penetration PVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10272708</link><description>Low-voltage distribution networks (LVDNs) have witnessed an increasing penetration of distributed photovoltaics (PVs), which exacerbates the existing voltage violation and voltage unbalance issues. PVs, energy storage systems, and voltage source converters can regulate voltages in hybrid AC/DC LVDNs. To solve the above two voltage problems simultaneously, a partition-based coordinated regulation method is proposed in this article considering the coupling of the two issues and the effect of active power on reactive power in electrical distance calculation. The voltage adjustments in different voltage violation scenarios are obtained based on a graph that describes the coupling of the two issues mathematically. In order to better determine control devices, the equivalent coefficient of active power adjustment on electrical distance calculation is considered in the partition method, in which regulation efficiency, regulation cost, and regulation capability are used as objectives. The coordination of controllable devices is achieved according to three-phase four-wire sensitivities. Case studies are performed to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed regulation method in hybrid AC/DC LVDNs.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Step Clustering and Generalized Nash Bargaining-Based Planning Strategy of Community-Shared Energy Storage for Large-Scale Prosumers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10274997</link><description>Inspired by economies of scale, the joint planning of community-shared energy storage (CSES) among prosumers provides a new solution to the issues of high investment costs associated with independent construction of individual energy storage. However, the cooperation among large-scale prosumers is rarely investigated and there is an urgent need to formulate an appropriate strategy. Hence, a multi-step clustering and generalized Nash bargaining (GNB)-based CSES joint planning strategy for large-scale prosumers is proposed. First, a CSES planning-oriented multi-step clustering algorithm based on nonparametric kernel density estimation (NPKDE) and a modified fuzzy C-means (FCM) algorithm is proposed to reduce the input data dimensionality of the planning model. Then, taking the optimal construction time sequence into consideration, a bi-level CSES joint planning model is established to minimize the total costs of prosumers. On this basis, a contribution rate index is designed to evaluate prosumers' bargaining power, and a GNB-based allocation strategy is formulated for realizing fair cost allocation. Finally, case studies show that the proposed strategy can help large-scale prosumers effectively deal with the joint CSES planning problem and achieve lower investment and operation costs. It also demonstrates that the proposed cost allocation approach is more efficient and practical than other cooperative game-based methods.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Coordinated Control Strategy for Frequency Regulation of MMC-HVDC Connecting Offshore Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278216</link><description>To solve the problems of weak inertia support and poor frequency regulation capability of power system, a novel coordinated control strategy for frequency regulation of MMC-HVDC connecting offshore wind farms (OWFs) is proposed to improve system frequency stability. In terms of inertia support, based on analyzing the available energy margin of MMC-HVDC, a virtual inertia control method based on decoupling control of DC voltage and capacitor voltage is proposed, which can fully utilize the energy margin of capacitors and improve its inertia support capability. The coupling relationship between the rotor speed of wind turbines and the frequency is directly established through DC voltage, an inertia support coordinated control strategy for MMC-HVDC and OWFs is designed to realize the rational utilization of available energy. In terms of primary frequency regulation, according to the local DC voltage, a primary frequency regulation control strategy is proposed for OWFs based on the variable speed control and pitch angle control. The overall coordination is realized through the reasonable design of control links and parameters, so as to improve the frequency stability of the system. Finally, the simulation model of MMC-HVDC connecting OWFs is built to verify the validity of the proposed control strategies.</description></item><item><title>Neural Networks-Based Inverter Control: Modeling and Adaptive Optimization for Smart Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10283888</link><description>The optimal voltage control of inverter-based resources, especially under the high penetration of solar photovoltaics, is critical to the stability of the distribution power system. However, the computational complexity as well as the coordinated operation performance of the voltage control optimization in the distribution power system limits the real-time applications. To mitigate this issue, a model-free based adaptive optimal control scheme for the smart inverter is proposed to maximize the active power generation, minimize the power loss, and maintain the bus voltages in smart distribution networks. An inverter-based optimization model for coordinated operation is first established, considering the uncertainties of renewable power generation. Subsequently, by collecting the data and control strategies, the neural networks (NNs) based algorithm is proposed to efficiently predict the best possible control strategy. The main objective of this scheme is to accurately predict candidate optimal solutions with near-negligible feasibility and optimization gaps, with the advantage of avoiding complicated iteration-based numerical algorithms. Thereafter, the co-simulation among OpenDSS, MATLAB, and Python is set up to fully take advantage of the three individual software. Experiments are conducted based on different control parameter characteristics and structures of NNs. The results reveal that an average mean squared error of 0.013 and 1 ms response time are achieved, which is lower than some state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>A Control Method Using Two Electromotive Forces and a Disturbance Observer to Improve the Dynamics of a Virtual Synchronous Machine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285072</link><description>The modern power grid is facing a significant challenge due to decreasing grid inertia, which is caused by the high penetration of renewable energy sources (RESs). Virtual synchronous machines (VSMs) have been considered as effective solutions to support the grid by providing inertial responses similar to that of traditional synchronous machines. However, fast and flexible dynamic responses to reference inputs, which can be achieved by conventional RES interfacing inverters, are degraded when inverters emulate the behavior of a synchronous machine. In this article, a current-referencing electrified synchronous machine (CURESYM) is proposed as a control method to adjust the dynamics to the reference input regardless of the parameter settings for emulating a synchronous generator. That is, the output current of CURESYM can be regulated with an intended dynamic response to follow the current reference. In addition, the accuracy of the current regulation can be enhanced by virtue of a disturbance observer. The fundamental characteristics of CURESYM are described with laboratory-scale experimental results. Finally, the effectiveness of CURESYM is discussed with practical data from on-site tests that applied the proposed method to a battery energy storage system in an actual island microgrid.</description></item><item><title>Day-Ahead PV Power Forecasting Model Based on Fine-Grained Temporal Attention and Cloud-Coverage Spatial Attention</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292906</link><description>With the increase of grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) power plants, measuring the uncertainty of PV output forecast due to multiple meteorological factors has become an important method to ensure the stable operation of the power system. However, the manual similar days' extraction methods of historical power features and cloud motion features, which are commonly used for PV spatial-temporal prediction, are inefficient and coarse-grained. In this paper, focusing on automatic attention of the local similar sequences in daily features, we improve the attention scoring method of the original transformer to increase the calculation accuracy of the similarity of PV power sequences. We construct an end-to-end PV power prediction framework using an encoder-decoder architecture. Based on the spatial-temporal similarity characteristics of PV output, the fine-grained temporal and cloud-covered spatial attentions embedded in the prediction framework are proposed using the improved similar sequence attention module. Among them, fine-grained temporal attention can dynamically position and utilize similar historical PV power sequences for the predicted period; cloud-coverage spatial attention automatically captures the neighbor site's matching PV power sequences. Experiments were conducted on a real PV dataset, and the root mean square error was reduced by 21.34% on average compared to the baseline model. The results proved the effectiveness of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Wind Power Scenario Generation Based on Conditional Latent Diffusion Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296015</link><description>Quantifying short-term uncertainty in wind power plays a crucial role in power system decision-making. In recent years, the scenario generation community has conducted numerous studies employing generative models. Among these generative models, diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities with excellent posterior representation. However, diffusion models are seldom used to quantify renewable energy uncertainty. To fill this research gap, this manuscript proposes a novel conditional latent diffusion model (CLDM) adapted for short-term scenario generation. CLDM decomposes the wind power scenario generation task into deterministic forecasting and forecast error scenario generation. The embedding network is used to regress deterministic forecasts, which reduces the denoising complexity of diffusion models. The denoising network generates forecast error scenarios in a latent space. Subsequently, the wind power scenarios are reconstructed by combining deterministic forecasts and forecast error scenarios. The case study compares with existing state-of-the-art methods, CLDM demonstrates superior evaluation metrics and enhances the denoising efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Periodic Allocation Mechanism for Allocating Demand Response Reserves Deployed by Multiple Ancillary Services</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296534</link><description>High penetration of renewable energy resources poses technical and economic challenges to system operation. Utilizing demand response to provide ancillary services is beneficial to the security of the grid, but for this, an adequate level of reserves to support possible ancillary services is required. Reasonable allocation of the demand response reserves (DRREs) deployed by different ancillary services can guarantee performance and participant profits during ancillary service provision. An allocation mechanism that periodically allocates DRREs for various ancillary services considering uncertainty and demand response resource (DRR) sufficiency is proposed to address this problem. The participants include purchasers and providers of DRRs. First, K-means clustering is used to obtain the occurrence characteristics of different ancillary service events. Second, the utility functions of the participants in the allocation process are modeled while fully considering the uncertainty in periodic allocation. Then, different types of Stackelberg games are formulated to determine the DRREs deployed by different ancillary services under different DRR sufficiency situations. Finally, an intraday scheduling method is presented to optimize the use of the allocated DRREs and achieve the expected regulation performance. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed allocation mechanism in terms of achieving a win-win situation for all participants.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Incentive Pricing on Charging Stations for Real-Time Congestion Management in Distribution Network: An Adaptive Model-Based Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298595</link><description>This paper concerns the pricing strategy for real-time distribution network congestion management, aiming at maximizing the total social welfare while eliminating congestion. The difficulty lies in dealing with the complex time-varying relationship between price and charging demand in the integrated power system and transportation network, and ensuring the safe application of the proposed method with limited real historical data. To address these challenges, we first model the EV user charging decision-making process to indirectly reflect the unquantifiable price and demand relationship, and then formulate the pricing problem as a bi-level model with a constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). After that, we propose a model-based safe DRL framework and develop an adaptive model-based safe deep reinforcement learning (AMSDRL) algorithm to solve the CMDP problem. AMSDRL learns the environment transition model and uses a strict and adaptive cost constraint to offset potential modeling errors. Compared to the state-of-the-art safe DRL methods, AMSDRL can be deployed with security guarantees by training on limited historical data, which is more practical for applications. The numerical results on modified IEEE 33-bus and 118-bus systems and a transportation network with real-world EV data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Autonomous Energy Management Strategy for Multi-Paralleled Hybrid Energy Storage Systems in the DC Microgrid With Mismatched Line Impedance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298785</link><description>In this paper, a decentralized P-V$^{2}$ droop-based energy management strategy for the hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs), including multiple batteries/supercapacitors (SCs), in the DC microgrid is proposed. By using the output voltage of the SC converter as the unified feedback voltage in each HESS, the impacts of non-negligible and mismatched line impedance on the power allocation performance and bus voltage tracking are eliminated. Compared with the I-V droop-based method, the adopted P-V$^{2}$ droop technique improves the stability of the HESS, especially considering the constant power loads (CPLs). In addition, the state-of-charge (SoC) recovery is considered for the SCs to prolong the service life of the HESSs. Finally, the experiment and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations have been carried out for the studied system to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Bayesian Hierarchical Model to Understand the Effect of Terrain on Wind Turbine Power Curves</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301539</link><description>This paper is concerned with explicitly modeling the effect of terrain on wind power curves. Terrain characteristics are spatially-varying but temporally constant, whereas other power curve-affiliating variables such wind speed, temperature, and wind power vary both spatially and temporally. In order to effectively model such two modes of variation in the data, we employ a Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) that connects the terrain characteristics with the parameters in a power curve. BHM jointly models the data from all turbines on a wind farm for attaining the turbine-specific, terrain-incorporating power curves. Our analysis shows that, out of the three terrain variables available in our data, ruggedness has the strongest effect on the power curve. We also evaluate the applicability of using the resulting power curve model for turbines on a different terrain and find that incorporating terrain information explicitly is beneficial. The specific BHM mechanism of using terrain information leads to 7&#8211;10% improvement over the group averaging approach.</description></item><item><title>A Stochastic Charging Station Deployment Model for Electrified Taxi Fleets in Coupled Urban Transportation and Power Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306294</link><description>Metropolitansworldwide are increasingly adopting electric taxis (ET) to address concerns about transportation-related emissions. However, the widespread deployment of electric taxis presents challenges in terms of increased electricity demand and changing demand profiles. This transition impacts both the urban transportation network (TN) and the electricity power distribution network (PDN), highlighting the interdependence between these two systems. In this paper, we propose a two-stage stochastic programming planning model that aims to optimize both the TN and PDN, enabling efficient deployment of charging stations and grid upgrades. Our model seeks to strike a balance between meeting ET drivers' charging preferences, minimizing the costs associated with infrastructure deployment and grid expansion, and harmonizing the coordination between the TN and PDN. Additionally, we explore the potential benefits of utilizing an autonomous ET fleet to enhance overall system performance.</description></item><item><title>Low-Voltage Survivability of Islanded Microgrids With Mixture of Single-Phase and Three-Phase DGs under Harmonic Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308631</link><description>Unbalanced low-voltage survivability of islanded microgrids under three-phase nonlinear load conditions in terms of primary control of distributed generations (DGs) is a research gap. This paper bridges the gap by proposing dynamic-sliding mode controller (SMC) for the voltage control loop and a novel current limiting strategy (CLS) based on the sliding-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) algorithm. The proposed sliding-DFT-based CLS separates fundamental and harmonic components of the reference value of inverter current and only restricts its fundamental component to a value less than the threshold value. The proposed dynamic-SMC, which presents robust performance with low chattering phenomenon, in combination with the sliding-DFT-based CLS prevents DG's output voltage distortion. This feature is favorable for supplying local and sensitive loads. Moreover, single-phase washout filter-based power sharing method has been implemented to ensure precise active power sharing and frequency regulation of the microgrid with mixture of single-phase and three-phase DGs during asymmetrical short-circuit faults as well as better fault clearance dynamics than the conventional three-phase droop control method. The offline and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation results also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed CLS and voltage controller applied to the control structure of DGs operating in the grid-forming mode in comparison with existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Secondary Control With an Event-Triggered Consensus-Based Observer for Energy Storage Systems in Islanded DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306326</link><description>This paper proposes a distributed secondary control strategy with an event-triggered consensus-based observer. Firstly, a voltage-shifting term is introduced in the proposed control strategy to ensure accurate current sharing, faster state-of-charge (SOC) balancing and bus voltage restoration. Since the SOC balancing speed becomes very slow when the difference in SOC between battery energy units (BEUs) is small, and SOC balancing of BEUs with low power is difficult. Therefore, an adaptive SOC balancing factor to improve the balancing speed is proposed in this control strategy. In addition, communication delay can lead to large errors in traditional consensus-based observers, and continuous communication can bring a significant burden. Considering these issues, the event-triggered consensus-based observer is proposed. This observer can achieve accurate average consensus under communication delay and greatly reduce communication burden. The convergence of the proposed observer under communication delay is theoretically proven, and the Zeno behavior is excluded. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy has been verified in MATLAB/Simulink and RT-LAB experiments.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Agent Graph Reinforcement Learning Method for Electric Vehicle on-Route Charging Guidance in Coupled Transportation Electrification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310266</link><description>This paper proposes a multi-agent deep graph reinforcement learning-based EV on-route charging guidance strategy, aiming at minimizing the charging cost for EV drivers in an uncertain and complex environment. First, a real-time online EV charging guidance framework with bi-timescales coupled transportation electrification is proposed. On the slow timescale, the distribution locational marginal pricing of the node where the charging station is located is solved by the power purchase cost optimization of the power distribution network. On the fast timescale, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning is used to solve real-time EV requests. Second, charging stations are considered as agents, and the potential competition for future charging demand at charging stations is considered. A multi-agent actor critic algorithm with embedded graph attention networks is proposed to optimize charging decision-making of EV drivers, which exploits the interactions between agents&#8217; observations using graph attention networks. Case studies are carried out in a practical area of Xi'an, China. We analyze the necessity of model components. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing charging cost and its applicability in PV-equipped scenarios is verified. The convergence performance and scalability are verified by the comparison with SAC and MADDPG algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Committed Carbon Emission Operation Region for Integrated Energy Systems: Concepts and Analyses</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313074</link><description>A novel concept called the committed carbon emission operation region (CCEOR) of integrated energy systems (IESs) is proposed in this paper, which provides a powerful tool for low-carbon operation analyses (LCOA) of IESs. The CCEOR of IESs is first defined, and a CCEOR model is then proposed by considering the uncertainty of renewable power outputs and the characteristics of low-carbon sequential operation. Based on the nonlinear constraint transformation method and distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) approach, a reformulation method is developed to convert the proposed uncertain nonlinear CCEOR model into a deterministic mixed-integer convex CCEOR model. The characteristics of the CCEOR are investigated. Based on the transformed CCEOR model, the CCEOR is a high-dimensional and bounded region composed of finite convex sub-regions. A region approximation method is then presented to construct the CCEOR. The effectiveness and applicability of the proposed CCEOR model and method are validated by numerical simulation on three test systems. Simulation results indicate that the proposed CCEOR can characterize the low-carbon feasible space (LCFS) visually, the visual coupling relationships between observation variables and LCFS, and the comprehensive low-carbon operation information of operation points.</description></item><item><title>Joint Sizing Optimization Method of PVs, Hybrid Energy Storage Systems, and Power Flow Controllers for Flexible Traction Substations in Electric Railways</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313989</link><description>Flexible traction substation (FTSS) integrates PVs, energy storage systems (ESSs), and railway power flow controllers (RPFCs) into the existing split-phase traction substation. It is a vital solution in advancing electric railways towards a low-carbon, efficient, and grid-friendly future. To improve the techno-economic performance of FTSSs, this paper proposes a sizing method to jointly size PV, RPFC, and battery-ultracapacitor hybrid ESS (HESS). Firstly, a flexible operation model of FTSS is established. It fully uses the capacity of RPFCs for improving the three-phase voltage unbalance and average power factor, thus, reducing the capacity requirements of RPFCs. Next, a linearized approach is developed for estimating battery aging affected by battery cycles, depth of discharge, state of charge, and calendar time. It facilitates obtaining battery sizing with relatively accurate life evaluation in sizing optimization. Then, a joint sizing optimization model of PV, HESS, and RPFC is established to minimize the total annualized investment and operation cost of an FTSS, and it is formulated as mixed-integer second-order programming. Finally, case studies show that the proposed method can optimize the total annualized cost of FTSSs while ensuring efficient energy utilization and improvements of the three-phase voltage unbalance and average power factor.</description></item><item><title>Novel Black Start Control Strategy With Power Boundary Analysis for PMSG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10319342</link><description>A novel power boundary analysis-based black start control (PBBC) strategy of PMSG-based wind turbines (WTs) is proposed in this paper to reduce the outage time of WTs and improve the reliability of wind power supply. The active power-rotor speed maximum boundary is quantified to estimate the kinetic energy (KE) reserve limit and the power response capability of the WTs during the black start period. In the power boundary analysis, the power response capability will collapse as the rotor speed increases to maximum. To achieve the trade-off between high KE reserve and power response capability, an overloaded power response control method during the black start period is developed, which can fully utilize the reserved KE. Moreover, the dc-bus capacitor charging model of WTs with initial KE is constructed, which can accurately represent the required KE of the WTs black start. The WTs are coordinated to achieve black start with the minimum backup power supply for the safety devices and auxiliary load according to the capacitor charging model. The proposed PBBC strategy can maximize the KE reserve of the WT and improve the power response capability, as well as reduce the backup power cost during the black start period.</description></item><item><title>Low Carbon Planning of Multiple Integrated Energy Systems Considering Trans-Regional Battery Logistics Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323512</link><description>With the emergence of integrated energy system (IES) paradigm, planning and control of multiple interconnected IESs starts to draw attention in academia.

Based on these, a low-carbon planning model is formulated for the multi-IES, which aims at minimizing the system's annual cost while satisfying a set of operational constraints. A CPLEX-based numerical optimization approach is developed for solving the proposed planning model and extensive numerical case studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving the energy efficiency and promoting decarbonization for multiple IESs.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Fault Ride-Through and Voltage Support Capability for MMC-HVDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farms Based on Multi-Mode Matching</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10336519</link><description>To cope with onshore AC faults in modular multilevel converter based high voltage direct current integrated offshore wind farms (OWF-MMC-HVDC), this paper proposes a multi-mode matching control (MMMC) approach. Mode I is active energy control. It is activated at high fault levels, when the reactive power output capability of the MMC is weak. Mode I uses the MMC sub-module energy to maximise the absorption of offshore surplus power to mitigate DC overvoltage problems. Mode II is dynamic reactive current optimization (DRO) control. It is activated at medium fault levels. It dynamically optimises the MMC active and reactive current command values within the permitted current margins. This simultaneously enables voltage support to the onshore grid and maximises offshore active power output, reducing offshore surplus power. Mode III is energy coordinated synchronous (ECS) control. It is activated under more mild faults. It allows simultaneous adjustment of the energy absorption rate of the wind farm-side MMC (WFMMC) and the grid-side MMC (GSMMC). This allows the energy margin of the MMCs to be utilised more fully to improve support to the onshore grid while maintaining fault ride-through capability. Finally the correctness and validity of the proposed method was verified by the PSCAD/EMTDC.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Optimization Based Voltage Injection Technique for Minimizing Imbalance and Harmonics in AC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10347373</link><description>Negative-sequence components and harmonics are generated in the current and voltage of an islanded AC microgrid under unbalanced and nonlinear loading conditions. Without any external controller or feedback signal filter, such components give power-sharing errors and develop voltage distortion at the output of participating inverters associated with particular sources. This paper proposes a decentralized inverter control scheme with an advanced voltage injection technique that minimizes the voltage unbalance factor (VUF) and reduces voltage total harmonic distortion (THD) in a low-voltage AC microgrid using Pareto multi-objective optimization (PMOO). It has a mean function with a second-order filter to minimize the DC offset and distortion in the feedback signal. It manages power sharing in a multi-bus distribution network with an advanced angle droop control. It also accounts for the line impedance, i.e., connecting the inverter unit to the network and the effect of zero sequence components. The simulation is tested on a modified CIGRE LV multi-bus distribution system with four wire configurations and experimentally validated on a two DG, single-bus resistive distribution model.</description></item><item><title>Data Driven Decentralized Control of Inverter Based Renewable Energy Sources Using Safe Guaranteed Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354415</link><description>The wide integration of inverter based renewable energy sources (RESs) in modern grids may cause severe voltage violation issues due to high stochastic fluctuations of RESs. Existing centralized approaches can achieve optimal results for voltage regulation, but they have high communication burdens; existing decentralized methods only require local information, but they cannot achieve optimal results. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methods are effective to deal with uncertainties, but it is difficult to guarantee secure constraints in existing DRL training. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a projection embedded multi-agent DRL algorithm to achieve decentralized optimal control of distribution grids with guaranteed 100% safety. The safety of the DRL training is guaranteed via an embedded safe policy projection, which could smoothly and effectively restrict the DRL agent action space, and avoid any violation of physical constraints in distribution grid operations. The multi-agent implementation of the proposed algorithm enables the optimal solution achieved in a decentralized manner that does not require real-time communication for practical deployment. The proposed method is tested in modified IEEE 33-bus distribution and compared with existing methods; the results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving decentralized optimal control with guaranteed 100% safety and without the requirement of real-time communications.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Objective Stochastic Optimization Approach for Planning a Multi-Energy Microgrid Considering Unscheduled Islanded Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10354526</link><description>The multi-energy microgrid (MEMG) improves the energy supply economy through a multi-energy coupling operation. However, due to faults or maintenance, outages may occur in the main grid, forcing the MEMG switch to the islanded mode, which heavily impacts the energy supply reliability. To solve this problem, a multi-objective stochastic optimization approach for planning the MEMG considering unscheduled islanded operation is proposed in this paper. This method aims to optimize the planning decision, improve the operation economy in the grid-connected mode and enhance the energy supply reliability in the islanded mode. A planning-operation co-optimization model is established with two objective functions: the minimum total planning cost and the minimum expected economic loss caused by islanded operation. The model incorporates equipment capacity allocation constraints, operation constraints in two operation modes and load curtailment constraints in the islanded mode. In addition to considering the uncertainties of load and renewable energy, the model of the uncertain islanded mode is established using four correlated random variables, and the scenario tree is used for islanded scenario generation. The adaptive weighted sum (AWS) method is used to solve the multi-objective model and obtain an optimal and evenly distributed Pareto frontier. On this basis, the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) is employed to determine the final planning scheme. Numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which makes a trade-off between planning economy and energy supply reliability.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming Control of Offshore Wind Farms Connected With Diode-Based HVdc Links Based on Remote Active Power Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10361591</link><description>The connection of offshore wind farms (OWFs) via diode rectifier-based- high-voltage direct current (DR-HVdc) transmission requires the use of wind turbine (WT) converters with grid-forming (GFM) capability. However, active and reactive power coupling and oscillation issues have been revealed in WTs employing reactive power frequency (Q/f) droop-based control schemes. This paper proposes a GFM control for OWFs based on remote active power regulation. The proposed scheme remotely regulates the active power of the DR-HVdc link by adjusting the dc voltage of the onshore modular multilevel converter (MMC). As a result, the voltages of offshore point of common coupling and WT converters are freed from being controlled for active power. On this basis, the WT converters can be equipped with classical GFM control schemes that incorporate active power frequency (P/f) and reactive power voltage (Q/V) droop relationships. The offshore frequency acts as an indication of the OWF active power balance and it is measured and transmitted to the onshore MMC through a communication channel to close the remote active power control. Comparative studies of power coupling characteristics and stability reveal that the proposed control scheme can achieve efficient decoupling control of active and reactive power in WT converters, prevent oscillation risks, and significantly enhance the system's stability. The feasibility and advantages of the proposed control scheme are verified through comparative time-domain simulations.</description></item><item><title>Incentivizing the Collaboration Between Travelers and Power-Traffic Network Operators: An Asymmetric Nash Bargaining Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363682</link><description>With the proliferation of electric vehicles and the deepened interdependence between power and traffic networks, tariff- and subsidy-based monetary incentives have been leveraged by network operators to shape vehicular&amp;amp;charging flow distributions to more closely align with network-level objectives. Travelers and network operators are generally regarded as two self-interested entities. As a result, the conflict between the system- and user-optimality usually forces travelers to bear an extra expenditure (either tariff payment or detour time) or requires network operators to dispense overmuch subsidies, both resulting in social welfare losses. The present work bridges this gap by designing a Cooperative Game based operation scheme that facilitates the collaboration between the two entities, in which collaborative travelers follow the social routing advice and then receive a certain level of reimbursement from network operators. To ensure a fair benefit allocation, we quantify the individual contribution as the difference of the path travel cost before and after the collaboration, then adopt the asymmetric Nash bargaining theory to settle the dispense of reimbursement. Numerical results on case studies indicate that the proposed model outperforms the subsidy-based non-cooperative Stackelberg Game in terms of promoting a win-win situation for both entities.</description></item><item><title>Wave Energy Optimal Control Structure With Second-Order Sliding Mode Tracking: Hardware-in-the-Loop Assessment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363673</link><description>This article presents a hardware-in-the-loop assessment of a moment-based optimal controller including a robust super-twisting tracking term. The aim of the overall control structure is to maximise the energy extracted by a flap-type wave energy converter. An experimental assessment is performed via hardware-in-the-loop testing, which allows experiments in a controlled environment and repeatable conditions. Key aspects of the control structure are analysed in the results, with particular focus on the behaviour of the second-order sliding mode tracking term. Robustness against modelling uncertainties and finite-time convergence are evaluated, initially for a single sea state, and then across three different sea conditions. Excellent tracking performance is observed for all considered operating conditions. Finally, the super-twisting algorithm in the tracking loop is compared with the performance of a linear controller synthesised based on Youla-Ku&#269;era parametrisation, observing that the former presents better tracking capabilities, also outperforming in terms of energy extraction.</description></item><item><title>Fuzzy Adaptive Frequency Support Control Strategy for Wind Turbines With Improved Rotor Speed Recovery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10365243</link><description>With the large-scale integration of wind power, the frequency stability of the power system is facing a significant challenge due to the wind power generation system typically operating in maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode. Traditional frequency support control methods for wind turbines (WTs) do not consider the state of WTs and the frequency changes simultaneously. This article proposes a fuzzy adaptive frequency support control strategy for WTs with improved rotor speed recovery. Based on fuzzy logic control, the proportional gain is adaptively adjusted using the rotor speed and frequency deviation to support the grid frequency. It can fully utilize the frequency support capability of WTs with more available rotor kinetic energy while averting the over-deceleration of WTs with low rotor speed. Moreover, as the frequency deviation increases, the output power of WTs is increased by a larger proportional gain to alleviate the excessive frequency degradation. In response to the shortcomings of traditional rotor speed recovery methods, an improved rotor speed recovery method is presented by integral control, which can restore the rotor speed in stages without affecting the frequency support performance of WTs and can avoid secondary frequency drop (SFD). Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Fault-Tolerant and Attack-Resilient Cooperative Control in an Offshore Wind Farm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10366828</link><description>Modern wind farms promise increased capacity, sustainability, and efficiency through the integration of information technology with the existing wind energy technologies. However, this integration creates a new category of cyber-physical vulnerabilities stemming from physical faults and/or cyberattacks potentially leading to devastating physical impacts and catastrophic consequences. The large scale and high complexity of a wind farm, in addition to its growing connectivity, control functionality, and wind intermittency and variability make the task of cyber-physical protection particularly challenging. This paper introduces novel approaches for guaranteeing the safety, security, and reliability of a modern wind farm under simultaneous occurrence of faults and attacks using an advanced cyber-physical health monitoring scheme, defined as &#8220;intrusion detection and fault diagnosis system&#8221;, as well as fault-tolerant/attack-resilient control strategies at different levels. The proposed fault-tolerant control strategy is based on adaptive model predictive control at turbine level, enhanced with a control reallocation mechanism at farm level. The attack-resilient control strategy is based on an automatic signal correction (ASC) technique that is applied at network operator level. The effectiveness of the suggested approaches is demonstrated using an offshore wind farm model under wind turbulences, measurement noises, and realistic physical fault and cyberattack scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Dual Current Control of Renewable Energy Sources for Recent Grid Code Compliance and Reliability Enhancement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10373073</link><description>Inverter-interfaced renewable energy sources (IIRESs) are controlled to follow low-voltage ride-through requirements during different fault conditions to support grid voltages and enhance stability. However, these requirements could result in improper operation of conventional protection functions, e.g., phase selection, that are designed based on the fault current characteristics of conventional power systems. In this paper, a dual-current controller (DCC) is designed for IIRESs to allow precise operation of the conventional phase selection method (PSM) while following the positive- and negative-sequence reactive current generation (RCG) requirements imposed by recent grid codes (GCs). First, the negative-sequence current reference is designed to comply with GC requirements and inject the minimum value of negative-sequence-active current that secures a correct operation of phase selection. Subsequently, the positive-sequence-reactive current is designed to comply with RCG requirements and allow injecting the maximum combination of the positive-and negative-sequence currents without hindering the proper operation of PSM or RCG requirements.

However, due to some inherent characteristics of this network, such as: (a) coupling among voltage and frequency dynamics, (b) dynamics of dc source, and (c) timescale coupling among converter and network, small-signal stability is a major concern. This paper proposes an adaptive feed-forward compensation scheme for each BESS unit to reduce dynamic interactions among converters and network/load parameters. Additionally, the proposed scheme can enhance system damping capability for a wide range of operating conditions without the need for any prior/ continuous generation/network information or additional sensors. This technique can preserve the voltage/frequency regulation capability of the traditional ($\omega -P/V-Q$) droop control scheme for any low voltage networks. The existing small-signal model is modified to include dc-source, dc link, and proposed feed-forward dynamics, which assists in analyzing the impact of dc-side, ac-side, and network parameters on system small-signal stability. The system performance is analyzed with extensive case studies conducted on a CIGRE TF C$6:04:02$ benchmark system. The proposed model is validated using a real-time digital simulator with hardware-in-loop setup.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Power Imbalance Time Series With Solar Power Penetration: Butterfly Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443304</link><description>Variable renewable energy (VRE) is known to be highly influenced by weather events and may ramp up or down abruptly. Therefore, increasing penetration of solar power will cause fundamental and structural changes to power system operation regimes. In this letter, we conduct an analysis of a 1-minute temporal resolution dataset from 6 Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs) in the US during 2018 and 2019. By examining day-ahead power exchange and real-time power imbalance time series characteristics, distinct patterns can be observed: the day-ahead power exchange time series curve looks like the canyon, while the real-time power imbalance time series curve looks like a butterfly shape, which becomes bigger as solar penetration level increases. This letter will provide some scientific evidence for the reform of the day-ahead power exchange and real-time power balance operation in response to high solar power penetration.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Power System Topology and Energy Management Scheme Design for Hydrogen-Powered Aircraft</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10172057</link><description>The electrification of the aviation industry is a major challenge to realizing net-zero in the global energy sector. Fuel cell (FC) hybrid electric aircraft (FCHEV) demonstrate remarkable competitiveness in terms of cruise range and total economy. However, the process of simply hybridizing different power supplies together does not lead to an improvement in the aircraft economy, since a carefully designed power system topology and energy management scheme are also necessary to realize the full benefit of FCHEV. This paper provides a new approach towards the configuration of the optimal power system and proposes a novel energy management scheme for FCHEA. Firstly, four different topologies of aircraft power systems are designed to facilitate flexible power flow control and energy management. Then, an equivalent model of aircraft hydrogen consumption is formulated by analyzing the FC efficiency, FC aging, and BESS aging. Using the newly established model, the performance of aircraft can be quantitatively evaluated in detail to guide FCHEA design. The optimal aircraft energy management is realized by establishing a mathematical optimization model with the reduction of hydrogen consumption and aging costs as objectives. An experimental aircraft, NASA X-57 Maxwell, is used to provide a detailed performance evaluation of different power system topologies and validate the effectiveness of the energy management scheme. The new approach represents a guide for future power system design and energy management of electric aircraft.</description></item><item><title>Plug-and-Play of Grid-Forming Units in DC Microgrids Assisted With Power Buffers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10186352</link><description>Grid-forming units (GFUs) are fundamental devices in DC microgrids for DC bus voltage regulation. Droop control is widely used for GFU control due to its Plug-and-Play feature. However, it may fail to meet some desired DC microgrid control features and performances, such as zero steady-state DC bus voltage deviation, high system inertia, and fast DC bus voltage regulation. To achieve these desired control performances, some advanced control strategies have been proposed, but the introduction of time-dependent terms or the centralized controller in these control strategies leads to the loss of the key Plug-and-Play feature for GFUs. To maintain the Plug-and-Play feature of GFUs while meeting the desired microgrid control features and performances, this paper proposes a power buffer based control framework. The power buffer is a new device combing a capacitor and a bidirectional DC-DC converter as an interface between GFUs and the DC bus. It enables the development of a novel decoupled control strategy where GFUs are regulated by the droop control while advanced control strategies are applied to the power buffer. Thus, the Plug-and-Play feature of GFUs is maintained, while specific DC microgrid performances are also achieved simultaneously. Supported by this power buffer based control framework, GFUs can be plugged in/out DC microgrids seamlessly at any time without introducing DC bus voltage fluctuations. This allows GFUs, especially mobile GFUs, to achieve high DC bus voltage regulation performance. The hardware-in-loop (HIL) test and real circuit experimental results demonstrate its efficacy.</description></item><item><title>Model Reduction for Grid-Forming Hybrid Renewable Energy Microgrid Clusters Based on Multi-Timescale Characterization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10188666</link><description>Due to the high-order model of photovoltaic and wind power generation systems, it is complicated to accurately establish the detailed state-space model of the multi-source renewable energy microgrid (MG) system. In addition, when the MGs are interconnected into microgrid clusters (MGCs), the difficulties of the control and stability analysis are greatly increased. However, the fast and slow dynamics of power electronic interface-based units may not be sufficiently separated on time-scale, which cannot directly follow the assumptions of the traditional model reduction method. This paper selects a typical grid-forming hybrid renewable energy MGC, where the multi-timescale characteristics of the system considering detailed electromagnetic and electromechanical transient modes are analyzed. An identification method without trial-and-error searching for coupling dynamics is proposed under the non-classical singular perturbation characteristics, which is unreported in previous studies and is different from the traditional power systems. Moreover, the reduced-order model can characterize multi-timescale while guaranteeing computational efficiency, which is able to further perform the key parameter optimization and stability analysis for the larger-scale MGCs. The theoretical analysis and the time-domain simulations verify the feasibility and the accuracy of the reduced-order model.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Planning of Dual-Zero Microgrid on an Island Toward Net-Zero Carbon Emission</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10197218</link><description>This paper proposes an optimal planning method for the dual-zero microgrid (DZMG) on an island. The DZMG is the off-grid microgrid that exchanges zero power with entity grids and operates in a net-zero carbon emission mode. A net-zero emission operating strategy is designed considering the positive interaction between  $\rm CO_{2}$  flow and energy flow. The multi-scale circulation of  $\rm CO_{2}$  flow is realized by coordinating the carbon capture system, solvent storage tank (SST), and direct air capture (DAC), while the seasonal shift of energy flow is completed by the hydrogen storage system (HSS) and DAC. An optimization planning model for DZMG is developed to size the SST, DAC, and HSS optimally. The net-zero emission target and the net-zero operating strategy are involved in the model to balance the environmental and economic concerns in the planning. Numerical experiments are carried out on two IEEE test systems and a real-world island microgrid to validate the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed method. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method reduces the planning cost by over 25% compared with the extant zero-carbon-based method. Besides, the economy of the DZMG positively correlates to carbon prices and technological maturity, while inversely relates to fuel prices.</description></item><item><title>A Transfer Learning-Based Method for Cyber-Attack Tolerance in Distributed Control of Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210203</link><description>Distributed secondary control of a microgrid highly relies on information exchange via communication networks, which may be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper aims to enhance the cyber-attack tolerance against various types of cyber-attacks, including false data injection (FDI) attack, denial of service (DoS) attack, latency attack. To this end, a data-driven signal estimator is developed based on a deep neural network (DNN), where the inputs are local sampled time-series measurements (frequency, voltage, active/reactive power) and the outputs are the sums of communicated signals from other units. To achieve a better generalization ability, a representation subspace distance (RSD)-based transfer learning model is designed for offline training. As an advantage, the proposed estimator can work for various working conditions without multiple training processes. For online stage, a reference tracking scheme is designed to recover the attacked signal based on the estimated signal, which mitigates or eliminates the effect of cyber-attacks. Finally, numerical case studies are presented to validate the effectiveness and advantages of the method.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Discrete Piecewise Droop Control in DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210195</link><description>In DC microgrids, the discrete piecewise droop control is an attractive decentralized control strategy due to its ability to better achieve load distribution targets within a preset bus voltage deviation range. However, the practical application of this control strategy is challenged by the difficulty of implementing switching among different segments of droop curves. The conventional hysteresis-based switching approach suffers from serious undesired droop curve switching issues that parallel distributed generators extremely easily switch to different segments of droop curves as loads vary. Consequently, the power distribution significantly deviates from its intended control objective, leading to suboptimal system performance and adversely affecting the durability and longevity of energy storage units that are costly to maintain. Even worse, certain units may abruptly overload, posing a significant safety threat to the entire system. In this paper, first, the negative effect and corresponding cause of undesired droop curve switching that occurs in the hysteresis-based discrete piecewise droop control are both comprehensively investigated. Accordingly, a decentralized adaptive discrete piecewise droop control featuring a distinct control structure and control logic is proposed. Compared to the hysteresis-based switch approach, the control structure enables continuous command regulation rather discretely. The control logic restricts the command change to a small value during a step cycle instead of a significant change. Furthermore, the proposed controller is comprehensively designed based on the transient analysis. Results from both simulations and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed control method.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Optimization for Reactive Power Sharing and Stability of Inverter-Based Resources Under Voltage Limits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210641</link><description>Reactive power sharing and voltage containment for inverter-based resources (IBRs) are two important but related objectives in inverter-based grids. In this paper, we propose a distributed control technique to achieve these objectives simultaneously. Our controller consists of two components: a purely local nonlinear integral controller that adjusts the IBR voltage setpoint, and a distributed primal-dual optimizer that coordinates reactive power sharing among the IBRs using neighbor-to-neighbor communication. The controller prioritizes the voltage containment objective over reactive power sharing at all times; except for the IBRs with saturated voltages, it provides reactive power sharing among all IBRs. Considering the voltage saturation and the coupling between voltage and angle dynamics, a formal closed-loop stability analysis based on singular perturbation theory is provided, which provides practical tuning guidance for the overall control system. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed controller for different case studies, we apply it to a low-voltage microgrid, the modified CIGRE medium-voltage network benchmark, and the IEEE 33 bus radial distribution system, all simulated in the MATLAB/Simulink environment.</description></item><item><title>Novel IoT-Based Droop Control for Battery SoC Balancing Among Multiple Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214366</link><description>Energy storage systems are a crucial part of microgrids, making up for their autonomous operation. Therefore, much research has focused on increasing their lifetime and operational efficiency. One of the most viable topics is maintaining connected energy storage units (ESUs) at the same state of charge (SoC). Droop control techniques have been developed in centralized, decentralized, and distributed fashions. This paper proposes a novel IoT-based droop control that can achieve SoC balancing not only within the same microgrid but also between multiple microgrids. The proposed architecture increases reliability and flexibility while allowing the system to be expanded, reconfigured, or upgraded, enabling the plug-and-play capability more easily. First, the proposed IoT-based hierarchical control and communication architecture is presented. Then, the proposed SoC balancing technique and its coordination with IoT architecture are introduced. Through 24-hour simulations, the proposed technique&#8217;s scalability, adaptiveness, and robustness are validated under different scenarios, including the operation of any microgrids or ESUs with different capacities and the operation in case of a communication failure. Finally, the IoT value chain of the proposed technique is experimentally validated using a physical laboratory microgrid that uses HTTP protocol to send and receive data through the ThingSpeak IoT-cloud service.</description></item><item><title>An Affine Arithmetic-Based Energy Management System for Cooperative Multi-Microgrid Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10224308</link><description>This paper presents an Energy Management System (EMS) for a Multi-Microgrid (MMG) system that considers power exchanges between a set of interconnected microgrids (MGs) in an Active Distribution Network (ADN), taking into account electricity demand and renewable energy generation uncertainties using an Affine Arithmetic (AA) approach. The deterministic EMS model is formulated as a cost minimization problem which includes detailed operational constraints of thermal generators and Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) within each MG, as well as power flow limits at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC), considering all power exchanges among the set of MGs and the ADN. The uncertainties are formulated in the AA domain to obtain an EMS model that is robust for a range of realizations of the uncertain parameters, with no need of statistical assumptions or repeated calculations, which can be solved with relatively low computational burden, as opposed to other approaches such as Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS). The proposed AA model is then tested and validated with data of a set of MGs in an ADN located in S&#227;o Paulo, Brazil, through comparisons with the deterministic model, MCS, and a Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (TSSP) approach. Results show an execution time improvement in the AA model of approximately 70% when compared to a MCS approach, which is expected to be slower, while considering the same range of uncertainties. Furthermore, the operation cost of the overall system decreases, as expected, by approximately 63% when power exchanges are enabled, as opposed to the individual operation of each MG, demonstrating the economic benefit of MMG systems.</description></item><item><title>Assessment and Mitigation of Multi-Mode Oscillations in Wind-Solar Hybrid Multi-Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225568</link><description>Multi-microgrids (MMGs) provide an effective solution for further improving the overall economy and ensuring resilience under major disasters, while high penetration level of renewable energy generations inevitably brings adverse oscillation problems to the system. So far, no comprehensive study has been carried out to assess the interaction and oscillatory stability of autonomous wind-solar hybrid MMGs. Besides, the feasible method giving consideration to coordinated control and simple communication architecture for damping out the multi-mode oscillations deserves further research. Therefore, this paper first establishes a detailed model of wind-solar hybrid MMGs by taking multiple types of renewable energy generations with similar and different response features in timescale into account, which are rarely included by most of the existing studies. Then, participation factor analysis is applied to reveal the multi-timescale interactions within the single microgrid and MMGs. Meanwhile, different critical influence factors, especially primary energy source fluctuations, are thoroughly investigated through sensitivity analysis to assess the multi-mode oscillations and stability issues. To mitigate the undesirable multi-mode oscillations, a hierarchical distributed damping controller based on the optimal partial output feedback technique is proposed subsequently. Finally, comparative tests are conducted to validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Additional Control Method for Extending Stable Operating Region of Multi-Terminal LVDC System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227311</link><description>The low damping of a multi-terminal low-voltage direct current (MT-LVDC) system with the influence of negative impedance characteristic in DC network, can reduce the system stability. This study aims to find an additional control method to extend the system stable operating region on the premise of not changing the local control system of each converter and not affecting the accurate tracking of each converter&#8217;s power command under their normal dispatching, thereby significantly extending the stable operating region of a MT-LVDC system by small damping powers, and ensuring the stable DC voltage when operating point changes. First, an additional control method based on feedback linearization is proposed. Then an analytical expression of damping powers required to realize additional control is built, and a method to obtain the overall stable operating region is established. Furthermore, a multi-objective optimization model for additional control is proposed, and the optimized additional controller is obtained using Pareto front solution. The proposed method is experimentally verified to be able to provide an effective method to improve the system stability with simple control structure and low complexity, which can be conveniently implemented in the MT-LVDC system.</description></item><item><title>Bi-Level Adaptive Storage Expansion Strategy for Microgrids Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10246411</link><description>Battery energy storage (BES) is a versatile resource for the secure and economic operation of microgrids (MGs). Prevailing stochastic optimization-based approaches for BES expansion planning for MGs are computationally complicated. This work proposes a data-driven bi-level multi-period BES expansion planning framework to determine the siting, sizing, and timing of BES installations. The proposed planning framework unifies deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and linear programming, thereby decoupling the determinations for the integer and continuous decision variables in two time scales, respectively. In the upper level, a rainbow DRL agent with quantile regression is trained to provide dynamic planning policies to accommodate stochastic renewable energy resources (RESs), load, and battery price changes efficiently. The lower level computes the optimal operation of MGs with frequency constraints to hedge the islanding contingency. The two levels communicate with one another by exchanging storage configuration and operating expenses in order to accomplish the shared goal of minimizing investment and operation costs. Comparative case studies on an MG are carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed DRL-based solution to the mixed-integer linear programming counterpart on efficiency, scalability, and adaptability.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Large-Signal Modeling of Inverter-Based Microgrids With Koopman Operator Theory for Autonomous Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10250860</link><description>The microgrid (MG) plays a crucial role in the energy transition, but its nonlinearity presents a significant challenge for large-signal power systems studies in the electromagnetic transient (EMT) time scale. In this paper, we develop a large-signal linear MG model that considers the detailed dynamics of the primary and zero-control levels based on the Koopman operator (KO) theory. Firstly, a set of observable functions is carefully designed to capture the nonlinear dynamics of the MG. The corresponding linear KO is then analytically derived based on these observables, resulting in the linear representation of the original nonlinear MG with observables as the new coordinate. The influence of external input on the system dynamics is also considered during the derivation, enabling control of the MG. We solve the voltage control problem using the traditional linear quadratic integrator (LQI) method to demonstrate that textbook linear control techniques can accurately control the original nonlinear MG via the developed KO-linearized MG model. Our proposed KO linearization method is generic and can be easily extended for different control objectives and MG structures using our analytical derivation procedure. We validate the effectiveness of our methodology through various case studies.</description></item><item><title>Voltage Sensitivity-Related Hybrid Coordinated Power Control for Voltage Regulation in ADNs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10174718</link><description>Voltage is a key operation index for active distribution networks. Coordinated power compensation of distributed energy resources (DERs) has shown promising results in alleviating voltage violation. Most methods use global optimization to obtain the optimal use of network-wide available resources, which becomes unfair when solving the same voltage issue of regional buses. Refined coordination of DERs on regional buses has not been formed as well. Therefore, this paper proposes a voltage sensitivity-related hybrid coordination algorithm. In order to fully tap into surplus reactive power of DESs, Volt/VAr control is considered in a higher priority than Volt/Watt control. For the selected crucial bus, a hybrid coordinated power compensation of regional DERs is designed in descending order of sensitivity or in proportion to available capacity under the same sensitivity value, which prioritizes using local and adjacent DERs to improve regulation effect and reduce changes in power flow. Due to the fact that voltage information is updated through association, the crucial bus needs to be reselected based on voltage assessment as a result, and the algorithm process will continue until the updated bus voltages become acceptable. Finally, the case study results in MATLAB indicate the effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Graph Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Inverter-Based Active Voltage Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10223729</link><description>Active voltage control (AVC) is a widely-used technique to improve voltage quality essential in the emerging active distribution networks (ADNs). However, the voltage fluctuation caused by intermittent renewable energy makes it difficult for traditional voltage control methods to deal with. In this paper, the voltage control problem is formulated as a decentralized partial observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP), and a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm is developed considering each controllable device as an agent. The new formulation aims to adjust the strategies of agents to stabilize the voltage within the specified range and reduce the network loss. To better represent the mutual interaction between the agents, a graph convolutional network (GCN) is introduced. By aggregating the information of adjacent agents, complex latent features are effectively extracted by the GCN, hence promotes the generation of voltage control strategy for the agents. Meanwhile, a barrier function is applied in MARL to ensure the system voltage within a safe operation range. Comparative studies are conducted with traditional voltage control and other MARL methods on IEEE 33-bus and 141-bus systems, which demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Neural Lyapunov Method for Transient Stability Assessment of Networked Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10208158</link><description>The transient stability analysis (TSA) of power-electronics-interfaced microgrids has a vital role in secure system operation. Such analysis normally entails extremely nonlinear and complex dynamics. Nearly all of the current studies have addressed this problem by making further assumptions in the system dynamics, and there remains an overall lack of an effective and general solution. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel neural Lyapunov framework with a trial solution structure for the TSA, which is a learning-based approach. On top of that, the modules that have been included within the framework consist of a learning and a falsification module. In general, the learning module iteratively learns the candidate Lyapunov functions via deep neural networks. The falsification module guides the learning process to satisfy the Lyapunov conditions and guarantees provable stability. The learned neural Lyapunov function attempts to identify the disturbances that the networked microgrid tolerates through the estimated region of attraction (ROA) in addition to determining large-signal stability. Applications of this method for power electronics interfaced networked microgrids are presented and multiple case studies are used to validate the suggested strategy. The findings demonstrate how the suggested framework expands the ROA while being quick, effective, and generalizable.

Specifically, we propose, respectively, SACPER (Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER)) and Constrained Variational Policy Optimization (CVPO) DRL algorithms to address the sequential decision-making problem of active network management (ANM) in distributed power systems and optimizing emergency load shedding (ELS) control problems. First, we propose SACPER for the ANM problem, which prioritizes the training of samples with large errors and poor policy performance. Evaluation of SACPER in terms of stability improvement and convergence speed shows that the ANM problem is optimized and energy loss and operational constraint violations are minimized. Next, we introduce CVPO for the ELS control problem, which is formulated as the Safe Reinforcement Learning (SRL) framework to address safety constraint prioritization issues in power systems. We consider additional voltage variables in the network as strong constraints for SRL to achieve fast voltage recovery and minimize unnecessary energy loss, while ensuring good training performance and efficiency. To demonstrate the performances of SACPER, we apply it to ANM6-Easy environment. The CVPO algorithm is applied to IEEE 39-Bus and IEEE 300-Bus systems. The simulation results of SACPER and CVPO are validated through extensive comparisons with other state-of-the-art DRL approaches.</description></item><item><title>Voltage-Price Coupling in Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210691</link><description>Demand-side users are practical and economical resources for participating in voltage regulation of distribution networks, whose regulation effect is closely related to the price. This paper proposes a novel voltage-price coupling (VPC) mechanism to construct a fair voltage-based nodal pricing method for distribution networks to encourage demand-side users to participate in voltage regulation to improve voltage quality. The voltage impact factor is established to fairly characterize the impact of each nodal power on the voltage deviation in the distribution network. Further, the VPC mechanism is constructed to highly couple the nodal price with the voltage in both spatial and time dimensions by establishing distribution rules of prices at different nodes and different horizons. The VPC mechanism forms a fair and adaptable voltage-based nodal pricing method for distribution networks, which also considers the impact on the existing pricing mechanism, and the balance between the voltage regulation effect and user experience. Then, a price-driven voltage regulation (PVR) model is proposed for the distribution network to reduce voltage deviations and user costs, which integrates the demand-side resource management, voltage regulation, and voltage-based nodal pricing. Case studies verify the effectiveness of the VPC mechanism and the PVR model.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Sizing of Behind-the-Meter Battery Storage for Providing Profit-Oriented Stackable Services</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10177780</link><description>This paper focuses on an advanced optimization method for optimizing the size of the behind-the-meter (BTM) battery energy storage system (BESS) that provides stackable services to improve return on investment. The grid frequency regulation service and two customer-side services, i.e., energy arbitrage and peak shaving, are selected as stackable services of BTM BESS. A two-stage stochastic programming model is proposed to handle uncertainty and achieve the most cost-effective BTM BESS size. The first stage obtains the optimal BTM BESS size with the maximum annual net income. The operating strategy of the BTM BESS is optimized in the second stage to maximize revenue while considering the BTM BESS degradation cost and the uncertainty of operating scenarios. A hybrid solution algorithm combining genetic algorithm and mixed-integer linear programming is employed to solve the two-stage stochastic programming model. A strategy based on a recorder and a filter is proposed to speed up the solution. In addition, a novel method for converting the second-level regulation signal into the equivalent minute-level signal is offered to reduce computational burden while maintaining high accuracy. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated based on an industrial load and regulation information from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market.</description></item><item><title>Probabilistic Multi-Energy Load Forecasting for Integrated Energy System Based on Bayesian Transformer Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185930</link><description>Probabilistic multi-energy load forecasting in an integrated energy system is very complex, because it needs to consider the following three aspects simultaneously: 1) Complex coupling relationship exists between multi-energy loads. 2) The intrinsic distribution of load uncertainties and dynamic changes of the distributions should be captured. 3) The probability distribution containing sufficient information should be generated. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-task Bayesian neural network, Bayesian Multiple-Decoder Transformer (BMDeT), which can capture both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and achieve the joint probabilistic forecasting of the multi-energy loads considering their complex coupling relationship and related uncertainties. Firstly, the proposed model adopts the one-encoder multi-decoder framework, which could catch the multi-load coupling information by one Bayesian encoder and perform respective subtasks by multiple Bayesian decoders. Specifically, the Bayesian multi-head attention mechanism is proposed to capture the complex coupling relationship and uncertainties between multi-energy loads by optimizing the distribution of network parameters. Then, a multi-task balance method based on Bayesian theory is proposed to quantify the uncertainties of different tasks by giving trainable weights. Finally, the proposed model has been verified on a real-world load data set, the results show that it has superior performance over other benchmark models.</description></item><item><title>Resilience Assessment for Integrated Energy System Considering Gas-Thermal Inertia and System Interdependency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10221865</link><description>The gas-thermal inertia and power-gas-heat interdependency, as two fundamental features of the IES, play a crucial role in IES resilience during extreme events. This paper proposes a comprehensive resilience assessment framework to investigate the influence of these two factors on IES resilience performance during extreme events. Considering the inherent operational properties of power distribution system (PDS), natural gas system (NGS) and district heating system (DHS), the interactions among multiple sectors and gas-thermal inertia, a dynamic optimal energy flow model is established to simulate the IES cascading failures and restoration process under outage scenarios. On this basis, the multi-stage resilience curves for the IES as well as each subsystem are obtained. Regarding the geometric features of the resilience curves, a set of interdependency metrics is further proposed to quantify the sensitivity of NGS and DHS vulnerabilities that arise from their interdependency with PDS. Comparative experiments are conducted to analyze the influence of gas-thermal inertia and system interdependency on IES resilience. The results demonstrated the proposed metrics can effectively assess the spatial and temporal interdependency among the resilience of power, gas, and heat subsystems, providing useful information for operators in identifying critical links and evaluating potential upgrades to enhance the resilience of IES.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Agent Distributed Operation Solution to Electricity and Natural Gas Distribution Systems for Enhancing Resilience</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229242</link><description>The multi-energy synergy of electricity and natural gas distribution systems (EGDS) offers a more proactive potential for resiliency in extreme contingencies. The interests of energy systems owned by different agents are nonnegligible in resilience enhancement. Existing distributed coordinated operation models seldom consider the multiple resilience resources co-scheduling cost and the social resilience enhancement benefit allocation. Absence of an equilibrium transaction settlement rule to constrain the &#8220;reap without effort&#8221; phenomenon and the concealed quotation behavior. To address this issue, this paper presents a multi-agent distributed operation and settlement model to EGDS for enhancing resilience, and a hierarchical solution based on the cooperative game theory is developed. Specifically, the model is formulated as a two-stage optimization framework including the social resilience enhancement subproblem and the transaction settlement subproblem. The transaction settlement rule of multi-energy coupling support is characterized as the model with quotation uncertainty is solved, and the balanced operational cost of a diverse allocation strategy is given as an output of the optimization. Two test cases of different scales are used to verify the validity and applicability of the model, whose numerical results show the subject interest and social interest are both improved while protecting privacy.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Energy Management of Multi-Entity Integrated Electricity and Heat Systems: A Review of Architectures, Optimization Algorithms, and Prospects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10237300</link><description>Synergies among multiple energy sectors in an integrated electricity and heat system (IEHS) improve energy efficiency, economic operation and renewable energy utilization, thus contributing to a sustainable society. In reality, however, energy sectors are owned and operated by different entities, constituting a multi-entity integrated electricity and heat system (ME-IEHS). This calls for distributed energy management due to the curse of dimensionality and privacy concerns. Specifically, it is challenging to achieve socially optimal coordination using local information and limited information exchange, while the key to distributed energy management is to decompose the integrated energy management problem into smaller subproblems for interactive entities, respectively. This paper first explains the fundamentals of IEHSs including the definition of entities. According to the interactions among entities, this paper then establishes and compares the current energy management architectures. Distributed optimization algorithms supporting distributed energy management of the IEHS are systematically reviewed, while the extension to deal with uncertainties in a distributed fashion is also summarized. Finally, future research directions regarding the strategic behaviors yielded from multi-stakeholders and the distributed learning solution are envisioned.</description></item><item><title>Smart Home Energy Management: VAE-GAN Synthetic Dataset Generator and Q-Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10171153</link><description>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in academia and industry in the analysis of electrical consumption in residential buildings and the implementation of smart home energy management systems (HEMS) to reduce household energy usage and costs. HEMS have been designed to emulate the statistical and functional characteristics of real smart grids. However, a major challenge in this research area is the limited availability of publicly accessible datasets. To address this challenge and further leverage the potential of artificial HEMS applications, it is crucial to develop time series that accurately represent diverse operating conditions of synthetic systems. This paper introduces a novel approach based on the combination of variational auto-encoder-generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN) techniques to generate time-series data of energy consumption in smart homes. Additionally, we investigate the performance of the generative model when integrated with a Q-learning based HEMS. The effectiveness of the Q-learning based HEMS is assessed through online experiments using real-world smart home data. To evaluate the quality of the generated dataset, we employ various metrics including Kullback&#8211;Leibler (KL) divergence, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), and the Wasserstein distance, which quantify the disparities between probability distributions of the real and synthetic data. Our experimental results demonstrate that the synthetic data generated by VAE-GAN closely aligns with the distribution of real data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the utilization of the generated data facilitates the training of a more efficient Q-learning based HEMS, surpassing the performance achieved with datasets generated using baseline approaches.</description></item><item><title>Customer Targeting for Load Flexibility via Resident Behavior Segmentation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10188905</link><description>Caused by the widespread of renewable energy resources, oversupply and overdesign of reserve capacity are serious concerns in electrical power system. Hence, power system needs load flexibility (LF) to mitigate the concerns. Despite utilities&#8217; efforts to aggregate LF for residential loads, aggregated LF operations are typically inefficient due to load uncertainties caused by individual customers&#8217; varying behaviors. Therefore, in this study, a novel customer targeting model for LF participation is proposed based on resident behavior analysis. The proposed scheme comprises a resident behavior segmentation model (RBSM) performing deep-learning-based and probabilistic clustering and a virtual LF operation model (VLFOM) considering human comfort. Simulations were conducted in a residential environment in San Diego, California. The superior performance of RBSM was confirmed through internal clustering evaluation methods. Accordingly, the results of the VLFOM model confirmed the criteria of resident behaviors for adequate LF participation. The experiment results present that the proposed model is economically and environmentally effective to the LF operation for utilities. Finally, implications of LF aggregation based on uncertainty assessment and meaningful suggestions of the settlement design for future LF expansion are presented.</description></item><item><title>Novel Incentive-Based Multi-Level Framework for Flexibility Provision in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210201</link><description>Within smart grids, end-users often seek to reduce electricity costs using a home energy management system, while the power utility aims to optimize the grid operation. This article proposes a novel three-level framework to tackle the contradictory nature of the objectives of end-user and distribution system operators (DSOs) by upward and downward flexibility provision. In addition, the proposed method designs a novel incentive program based on the flexibility provided by the end-users. Then, the aggregated flexibility is offered to the DSO. The model takes advantage of the local flexibility of home appliances to re-schedule their use based on the flexibility request from the DSO. The aggregator provides incentive programs based on the flexibility provided by the prosumers to reduce/shift energy consumption. The proposed methodology considers the alignment of the conflicting techno-economic objectives of the prosumers and system operators. The results show that our proposed strategy has increased the monetary benefits for prosumers for their flexibility services provided to the DSO compared to other scenarios. Moreover, the proposed method improves the voltage profiles and reduces the peak load and power losses by 20.8% and 24.6%, respectively, of the overall system.</description></item><item><title>Predicting Strategic Energy Storage Behaviors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214105</link><description>Energy storage are strategic participants in electricity markets to arbitrage price differences. Future power system operators must understand and predict strategic storage arbitrage behaviors for market power monitoring and capacity adequacy planning. This paper proposes a novel data-driven approach that incorporates prior model knowledge for predicting the strategic behaviors of price-taker energy storage systems. We propose a gradient-descent method to find the storage model parameters given the historical price signals and observations. We prove that the identified model parameters will converge to the true user parameters under a class of quadratic objective and linear equality-constrained storage models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments with synthetic and real-world storage behavior data. The proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy of storage model identification and behavior forecasting compared to previous blackbox data-driven approaches.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Coordination Strategy for Heterogeneous Building Flexible Thermal Loads in Responding to Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10221860</link><description>Air conditioning systems are promising energy flexibility resources for smart grids. However, buildings with various thermodynamics must be coordinated to utilize limited energy flexibility effectively. This study proposes a distributed coordination strategy to coordinate building flexible thermal loads of different characteristics for optimized utilization of energy flexibility in a scalable and distributed manner. It consists of two components:1) an average consensus-based distributed sensing scheme to estimate the average thermal state of charge (SoC) of multiple zones, and 2) a weighted consensus-based distributed allocation module to allocate the demand response (DR) tasks or limited energy resources to multiple zones, proportional to their thermal storage capacities and deviations to the average thermal SoCs. Both algorithms achieve their goals respectively by fully distributed means through a sparse network with neighbor-to-neighbor communication. The sufficient condition for converging the weighted consensus algorithm is also derived for the first time. The proposed strategy is adopted for 1) weighted DR participation of residential inverter air conditioners and 2) weighted water flow redistribution of the commercial building water heating systems under urgent DR events. Simulation results show that adopting the distributed coordination strategy avoids the early depletion of demand flexibility resources and nonuniform thermal comfort sacrifices under uncoordinated control.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Online Game-Theoretic Framework for Real-Time Energy Trading in Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227354</link><description>In this paper, the real-time energy trading problem between the energy provider and the consumers in a smart grid system is studied. The problem is formulated as a hierarchical game, where the energy provider acts as a leader who determines the pricing strategy that maximizes its profits, while the consumers act as followers who react by adjusting their energy demand to save their energy costs and enhance their energy consumption utility. In particular, the energy provider employs a pricing strategy that depends on the aggregated amount of energy requested by the consumers, which suits a commodity-limited market. With this price setting, the consumers&#8217; energy demand response strategies are designed under a non-cooperative game framework, where a unique generalized Nash equilibrium point is shown to exist. As an extension, the consumers are assumed to be unaware of their future energy consumption behaviors due to uncertain personal needs. To address this issue, an online distributed energy trading framework is proposed, where the energy provider and the consumers can design their strategies only based on the historical knowledge of consumers&#8217; energy consumption behavior at each bidding stage. Besides, the proposed framework can be implemented in a distributed manner such that the consumers can design their demand responses by only exchanging information with their neighboring consumers, which requires much fewer communication resources and would thus be more suitable for the practical operation of the grid. As a theoretical guarantee, the proposed framework is further proved to asymptotically achieve the same performance as the offline solution for both energy provider and consumers&#8217; optimization problems. The performance of practical designs of the proposed online distributed energy trading framework is finally illustrated in numerical experiments.</description></item><item><title>Novel Architecture of Energy Management Systems Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning in Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10255281</link><description>In microgrids, energy management systems (EMS) have been considered essential systems to optimize energy scheduling, control and operation for reliable power systems. Conventional EMS researches have been predominantly performed by employing demand-side management and demand response (DR). Nonetheless, multi-action control in EMS is confronted with operational challenges in terms of the profitability and stability. In this paper, energy information systems (EIS), energy storage systems (ESS), energy trading risk management systems (ETRMS), and automatic DR (ADR) are integrated to efficiently manage the profitability and stability of the whole EMS by optimal energy scheduling. The proposed microgrid EMS architecture is optimized by using proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm, which has been known to have good performance in terms of learning stability and complexity. A novel performance metric, represented as a burden of load and generation (BoLG), is proposed to evaluate the energy management performance. The BoLG is incorporated into the reward settings for optimizing the management of multi-action controls such as load shifting, energy charging-discharging, and transactions. From the simulation results, it is confirmed that the proposed architecture can improve energy management performance with the proper trade-off between stability and profitability, compared to dynamic programming (DP)-based and double deep Q-network (DDQN)-based operation.</description></item><item><title>Black Start of Coastline Power Networks From Grid-Forming Ship-to-Grid Services</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10168164</link><description>The expansion of electric ships in the transportation sector, along with environmental advantages, has the potential to enhance the resilience and stability of coastline power grids during blackouts or emergencies through ship-to-grid technology. The power grids located in remote coastal and island communities often face high energy costs and are more vulnerable to blackouts due to their increased risk of natural disasters. Ship-to-grid technology offers an innovative localized solution that enables onshore utilities to avoid the need for installing excessive on-land energy storage capacity to enhance stability and resiliency in the coastline power grid. Electric ships can provide a flexible source to restart power to critical facilities such as hospitals and communication networks. In this paper, a comprehensive scheme for integrating ships into the grid system is proposed, which involves a grid-forming control approach through a DC-link connection. The approach employs a droop-based control strategy, current limiter control, and voltage source grid interface to regulate both voltage and frequency at various stages of the coastline power network restoration. The approach is verified using a 4-zone shipboard power system with grid-forming DC-link connection, for black start of a modified IEEE 30-bus test system during a multi-step black start and re-energization process.</description></item><item><title>Coupling Constraint Behavior and Design Method for Two-Degree-of-Freedom in Series-Parallel Architecture Electric Energy Router</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10174282</link><description>For low-voltage distribution networks (LVDNs), the series-parallel architecture electric energy router (SPA-EER) has two obvious advantages under two-degree-of-freedom (TDF) control, that is, power flexible operation and up to 200% power transmission. However, there are coupling constraint behaviors between TDF, which will mutually limit their operation ranges. To this end, by analyzing simultaneous operation principles of active and reactive powers in SPA-EER, these coupling constraint behaviors are revealed, which is important for specifying the TDF operation ranges and promoting the safe operation for SPA-EER. Additionally, the effects of TDF on the maximum available active and reactive powers output by SPA-EER system are discussed, which can provide a basis for the mode selection of system. Based on the criterion of maximizing the utilization of renewable energy, a mode generator (MG) considering the actual powers of load, DC bus, LVND port, series converter and parallel converter is proposed to determine the suitable values for TDF, and then a MG-based TDF power flow flexible control (TDFPFFC) is developed to respond to demands of different operation modes. Finally, the simulation results are presented to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed MG-based TDFPFFC.</description></item><item><title>Tracing, Ranking and Valuation of Aggregated DER Flexibility in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10186453</link><description>The integration of distributed energy resources (DER) makes active distribution networks (ADNs) natural providers of flexibility services. However, the optimal operation of flexible units in ADNs is highly complex, which poses challenges for distribution system operators (DSOs) in aggregating DER flexibility. For example, to maximise the provision of services, flexible units must be strongly coordinated to manage network constraints, e.g., by performing simultaneous flexible power consumption and production in different parts of the network (referred to as power swaps in this work). Furthermore, due to the nonlinearities of aggregated DER flexibility provision, some units may need to rapidly change their outputs to enable the services. To address these challenges, this paper brings together exact AC optimal power flow (OPF) models and a cooperative game formulation and presents a new framework for tracing, ranking, and valuation of aggregated DER flexibility in ADNs. Extensive tests and simulations performed for the 33-bus radial distribution network demonstrate that the framework enables translating complex DER interactions into useful information for DSOs by ranking the criticality of flexible units and performing flexibility valuation based on its cost or economic surplus. Additionally, the framework proposes no-swap constraints and a nonlinearity metric which can be used by DSOs to identify unreliable operating regions with power swaps or rapid changes in flexible unit dispatch.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Operating Envelope-Based Local Energy Market for Prosumers With Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10208161</link><description>This paper presents a new framework for the management of prosumers with electric vehicles (EVs) and photovoltaic (PV) systems in a local energy market (LEM) using the dynamic operating envelope (DOE) that secures the network operation for prosumers&#8217; trading and allows prosumers to manage EVs charge/discharge with PV systems. Prosumers can configure the charge/discharge status of their EVs depending on mobility and determine their net import/export power which will be used to establish DOEs. The proposed framework incorporates a bidding strategy to enable prosumers to participate in the LEM within DOE limits, and peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is developed to offer economic benefits to prosumers. The framework&#8217;s performance is evaluated with a 100% penetration level of EVs and PV systems on the IEEE 55-node low-voltage European test system. The simulation results demonstrate that DOEs can facilitate prosumers in managing their imports/exports for trading without violating voltage and congestion limits. The proposed framework efficiently manages EV charging/discharging with PV systems and enables prosumers to make optimal bids within DOEs, thereby benefiting from P2P trading in the LEM.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Distributed Privacy-Preserving Energy Management System for Networked Microgrid Cluster Based on Homomorphic Encryption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10232904</link><description>The networked microgrid cluster (NMGC) integrating multiple heterogeneous microgrids is an effective way to improve the renewable energy utilization. However, the centralized scheduling scheme may be less secure and suffer from privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a fully distributed privacy-preserving energy management framework for secure and fair energy sharing within NMGC. To this end, firstly, a robust energy management model based on generalized Nash bargaining is formulated for proactive energy sharing and fair benefit allocation among microgrids. Then, a fully distributed optimization algorithm combining the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm and distributed consensus protocol is designed for the formulated energy management model. It only depends on flexible peer-to-peer communication without needing any third-party coordinators, potentially preventing a single-point failure. Furthermore, a privacy preservation communication scheme based on homomorphic encryption is designed for the developed distributed optimization algorithm. With the proposed privacy preservation scheme, that is, by using ciphertext instead of plaintext throughout the entire communication and computation process, the privacy of each microgrid can be prevented from being leaked to malicious adversaries and eavesdroppers. Finally, the effectiveness and superiorities of the developed distributed energy sharing mechanism are verified via numerical case studies.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Distributed Load Restoration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10236471</link><description>This paper addresses the load restoration problem after power outage events. Our primary proposed methodology is using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning to optimize the load restoration process in distribution systems, modeled as networked microgrids, via determining the optimal operational sequence of circuit breakers (switches). An innovative invalid action masking technique is incorporated into the multi-agent method to handle both the physical constraints in the restoration process and the curse of dimensionality as the action space of operational decisions grows exponentially with the number of circuit breakers. The features of our proposed method include centralized training for multi-agents to overcome non-stationary environment problems, decentralized execution to ease the deployment, and zero constraint violations to prevent harmful actions. Our simulations are performed in OpenDSS and Python environments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using the IEEE 13, 123, and 8500-node distribution test feeders. The results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve a significantly better learning curve and stability than the conventional methods.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming and Spatially Distributed Control Design of Dynamic Virtual Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10239108</link><description>We present a novel grid-forming control design approach for dynamic virtual power plants (DVPP). We consider a group of heterogeneous grid-forming distributed energy resources (DER) which collectively provide desired dynamic ancillary services, such as fast frequency and voltage control. To achieve that, we study the nontrivial aggregation of grid-forming DERs to establish the DVPP, and employ an adaptive divide-and-conquer strategy that disaggregates the desired control specifications of the aggregate DVPP via adaptive dynamic participation factors to obtain local desired behaviors of each DER. We then design local controllers at the DER level to realize these local desired behaviors. In the process, physical and engineered limits of each DER are taken into account. We extend the proposed approach to make it also compatible with grid-following DER controls, thereby establishing the concept of so-called hybrid DVPPs. Furthermore, we generalize the DVPP design to spatially dispersed DER locations in power grids with different voltage levels and  $R/X$  ratios. Finally, the DVPP control performance is verified via numerical case studies in the IEEE nine-bus transmission grid with an interconnected medium voltage distribution grid.</description></item><item><title>DER Capacity Assessment of Active Distribution Systems Using Dynamic Operating Envelopes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243614</link><description>The increasing deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) within electricity distribution systems can push them outside their safe operational limits. This urges the distribution system operators (DSO) to perform a DER capacity assessment that utilises the network&#8217;s full potential to accommodate more DER while ensuring the network&#8217;s safety. However, this is a challenging task as the DER units are mostly consumer-owned and therefore the DSO does not have control over them. To overcome this challenge, this paper first develops dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs). A DOE is a convex set defining acceptable real and reactive powers exchange with the grid at a consumer connection point without violating any network constraints. We propose a novel methodology to calculate a DOE by applying the right-hand side decomposition technique through which we allocate the network&#8217;s capacity to mutually independent consumers. We then build a hierarchical DER capacity assessment within DOEs that considers the uncertainty of solar power and demand when making investment decisions. In the proposed framework, the consumers are then free to make their decisions as long as they comply with their DOEs.</description></item><item><title>Fairness-Incorporated Online Feedback Optimization for Real-Time Distribution Grid Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251452</link><description>With the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources such as photovoltaics (PVs), frequent voltage and congestion problems are expected to occur in distribution grids. Existing solution approaches based on centralized or distributed offline optimization cannot handle the dynamics of distribution grids in real time, i.e., by the time the computations are finished, the used data are already outdated as the grid loadings evolve so fast. Moreover, the unfair distribution of costs or burdens among end-users to relieve network issues, for example with PV curtailment, has not been sufficiently considered either. To address these issues, a fairness-incorporated online feedback optimization (OFO) approach is proposed. This approach produces implementable intermediate iterates for inverter-based assets using online optimization and suitably integrated measurements, and thus can work with the distribution grid dynamics. Moreover, it addresses the unfairness issue by modifying the voltage sensitivity matrices and leverages the feedback-based nature of OFO to compensate for the resulting modeling inaccuracies. Case studies based on a 96-bus low-voltage grid demonstrate the effectiveness of the fairness-incorporated OFO to handle the distribution grid dynamics and improve fairness, in both static and dynamic cases, with balanced and unbalanced grid models.</description></item><item><title>Successive Convexification Algorithms for Optimizing Power Systems With Energy Storage Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10254570</link><description>Energy storage systems (ESSs) are increasingly used in power system optimization. Different ESS mathematical models are developed that consider nonlinear functions for power losses. However, these models require non-convex constraints to represent the ESS losses, resulting in challenging optimization problems. To reduce the complexity, convex relaxation models are often derived but generate infeasible solutions when the relaxation exactness is violated. To deal with this issue, this work develops two successive convexification algorithms that generate fast and high-quality feasible solutions when the derived solution is not exact. The first algorithm handles general loss functions, while the second algorithm enhances performance when piecewise-linear loss functions are used. Specifically, the algorithms reduce the feasible region of the relaxed ESS models using a tightening box trust region around the current solution in successive iterations. The proposed algorithms are applied to the Unit Commitment and Peak Shaving and Energy Arbitrage problems to investigate their performance considering piecewise-linear and quadratic ESS loss functions. Simulation results demonstrate the impact of the ESSs relaxation violation on the actual system operation and validate the algorithms efficacy to generate high-quality feasible and even optimal solutions with significantly lower execution times compared to problems utilizing exact ESS models.</description></item><item><title>An Inverse Optimization Method for Electric Vehicle Charging and Road Toll Pricing in Coupled Urban Transportation and Power Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10173663</link><description>This is the sequel to our earlier paper on A Decentralized Bi-level Decomposition Method for Optimal Operation of Electric Vehicles in Coupled Urban Transportation and Power Distribution Systems. After presenting the pricing framework, coordinated operation model and bi-level decomposition algorithm to obtain the optimal operation state in the previous work, this paper presents the pricing approach to adjust EVs&#8217; behavior and achieve that expected state. First, the network equilibrium (NE) and social optimum (SO) operation states are defined, based on which the traditional marginal social cost pricing is developed as benchmark. Second, in light of inverse optimization approach, the minimum charge pricing is proposed which adopts road tolls, charging prices and plug-in fees to coordinate the system operation. Different from the traditional pricing approach, the proposed one can align coupled power-transportation network (CPTN) flows from the spontaneously-formed NE with the least-cost SO state, while minimizing extra user charges. Third, various partial pricing schemes are developed to approximate the expected SO state for practical applications. Finally, case studies on a modified real-world urban network verify the effectiveness and performance of the pricing method. It is proven to significantly reduce the extra user charges while attaining the same optimum state.</description></item><item><title>A Coordinated Model for Multiple Electric Vehicle Aggregators to Grid Considering Imbalanced Liability Trading</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10180215</link><description>In the interaction between electric vehicle (EV) and grid, research on the coordinated optimization of different EV aggregators to reduce the adverse effect of EVs uncertainty is of great significance. This paper commits to formulating an imbalanced liability trading cooperation platform among multiple EV aggregators in real-time (RT) market. First, we propose a joint bidding model of multiple EV aggregators in RT market from the individual perspective. Each aggregator optimizes its internal bidding strategy and external imbalanced liability trading simultaneously. Next, considering the self-interest of each EV aggregator, the cooperative model is built based on general Nash bargaining (GNB) theory. To promote EV aggregators to trade but avoid over-dependence, each EV aggregator&#8217;s bargaining power is formulated by both individual trading quantity and trading dependence. Then, we decompose the model into two subproblems and introduce the neurodynamic-based algorithm for distributed solving. Finally, numerical results show that the proposed coordinated model can reduce the adverse effect of EVs&#8217; uncertainties on grid power balance to some extent, and realize cost saving or even profit earning for aggregators.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Machine Learning Forecasting for Online MPC of Work Place Electric Vehicle Charging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10184283</link><description>This work proposes a novel EV forecasting technique that predicts each EV&#8217;s arrival time (AT), energy demand (ED) and plug duration (PD) over the course of a calendar day using a hybrid machine learning (ML) forecast. The ML forecasts as well as persistence forecasts are then input in a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm that minimizes the electricity costs incurred by the charging provider. The MPC with the hybrid ML forecast reduced peak loads and monthly electricity costs over a base case scenario that determined costs for uncontrolled L2 charging: Reductions in weekday mean peak load during a 30 day summer time case study were 46.7% and 2.8% from the base case to ML MPC and persistence to ML MPC, respectively. Reductions in utility costs during the summer case study were 20.9% and 0.1% from base case to ML MPC and persistence to ML MPC respectively. Results are similar for a 30 day winter case study.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Mitigating the Cycle Aging Cost of Vehicle Batteries in Energy Transportation Nexus</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185627</link><description>There is a critical need to protect batteries from degradation to achieve the benefit of electric vehicles (EVs) in the energy and transportation sectors. However, existing battery degradation models have either failed to reflect the actual battery cycle aging mechanism, or are too complex for practical vehicle energy management. This paper presents a new approach for the efficient integration of battery cycles aging mechanisms into vehicle energy management by a prioritized experience-driven imitative learning (PExp-IL) framework. A prioritized degradation experience pool is constructed by comprehensively analyzing battery cycle aging mechanisms in vehicle standard driving schedules. Battery cycle aging features are mathematically presented by learning the expert experience that characterizes its degradation under different working conditions imitatively. The battery protective target is achieved by integrating the established gradient aging model into a vehicle energy management optimization problem. With the anti-aging policy gradient, battery aging mitigation can be easily incorporated into vehicle energy management scenarios that highly depend on algorithm computation efficiency. Two detailed demonstrative cases are further constructed to realize the anti-aging battery management in hybrid vehicles and grid integration of EVs. This approach provides a new practical solution for improving vehicle total economy by mitigating battery aging costs, which can contribute to net zero in the energy-transportation nexus.</description></item><item><title>Market-Based Coordinated Planning of Fast Charging Station and Dynamic Wireless Charging System Considering Energy Demand Assignment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10197206</link><description>With the rapid growth of electric vehicle (EV) penetration, EV charging demand is becoming greater and diversified. To meet the diverse EV charging demand, we propose a market-based coordinated planning method of fast charging station (FCS) and dynamic wireless charging system (DWCS). Firstly, a bi-level coordinated planning model considering the benefits of charging service provider and EV user group is built. It can make full use of the complementary characteristics of FCSs and DWCSs. Then, the energy demand assignment(EDA) approach that can directly assign energy demand to roads and power nodes is proposed and applied in the inner level of bi-level coordinated planning model. Finally, the cases that consider the impact of differentiated traffic demand and land prices in different regions are proposed. The case studies are formulated based on the 21 power nodes-12 traffic nodes network and the 54 power nodes-25 traffic nodes network. To calculate the optimal solution, the KKT conditions, the McCormick relaxation approach, the optimization-based bound tightening approach (OBBT) and the sequential bound tightening approach (SBT) are employed. Numerical simulation results validate that the proposed method can effectively improve the profits of charging service provider and keep the EV users&#8217; charging cost at relatively low range.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Transient Stability Evaluation of Electric Distribution Networks Dominated by EV Supercharging Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227373</link><description>Accelerated deployment of high-power electric vehicle (EV) supercharging stations is expected to alleviate EV drivers&#8217; range anxiety, while imposing stress on the electric distribution networks (EDNs) and threatening their transient stability. As a powerful transient stability evaluation (TSE) tool, the estimation of region of attraction (ROA) plays a vital role in maintaining situational awareness and stable operation of the emerging EDNs. However, EDNs dominated by EV charging stations typically involve highly nonlinear and complex system dynamics, rendering the model-based approaches for ROA estimation computationally intensive. Thus, solution accuracy is usually compromised due to simplified system modeling. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to ROA estimation of emerging EDNs based on the Koopman operator theory. Numerically stable Koopman eigenfunctions can be learned from the system measured data and then employed to establish a set of linearly parameterized Lyapunov candidate functions. Various trajectory data are then employed to establish a tight feasible polytope. Through efficient sampling and linear optimization, the union of invariant sublevel sets of the determined Lyapunov functions can constitute a tight inner approximation to the actual ROA. The proposed method is evaluated to be computationally efficient and permits real-time ROA estimation. Numerical simulations of a DC EDN interfaced to an AC grid validate the superior performance of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading via Hybrid Secure Computations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10176288</link><description>The massive integration of uncertain distributed renewable energy resources into power systems raises power imbalance concerns. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading provides a promising way to balance the prosumers&#8217; volatile energy power generation and demands locally. Particularly, to protect the privacy of prosumers, distributed P2P energy trading is broadly advocated. However, severe privacy leakage issues can emerge in the realistic fully distributed P2P energy trading paradigm. Meanwhile, in this paradigm, two-party and multi-party computations coexist, challenging the naive privacy-preserving techniques. To tackle privacy leakage issues arising from the fully distributed P2P energy trading, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving approach via hybrid secure computations. A secure multi-party computation mechanism consisting of offline and online phases is developed to ensure the security of shared data by leveraging the tailored secret sharing method. In addition, the Paillier encryption method based on the Chinese Remainder Theorem is proposed for both the secure two-party computation and the offline phase of the multi-party computation. The random encryption coefficient is designed to enhance the security of the two-party computation and simultaneously guarantee the convergence of the distributed optimization. The feasible range for the encryption coefficient is derived with a strict mathematical proof. Numerical simulations demonstrate the exactness, effectiveness, and scalability of the proposed privacy-preserving approach.</description></item><item><title>Moment-Based Distributionally Robust Peer-to-Peer Transactive Energy Trading Framework Between Networked Microgrids, Smart Parking Lots and Electricity Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190171</link><description>This paper proposes a decentralized scheduling framework for peer-to-peer (P2P) transactive energy trading between prosumers and the local electricity market (LEM). In this approach, prosumers are modeled in the form of networked microgrids (NMG) and smart parking lots (SPL), which can exchange energy in a P2P framework. At the same time, each of the prosumers exchanges information and energy with the LEM in a decentralized approach based on the distribution locational marginal price (DLMP). The LEM is modeled by an active radial electricity distribution network (EDN), considering a high penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) and the feeder power losses in a convex optimization model. In proposed P2P transactive energy model, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been used to achieve the equilibrium point between peers. The distributionally robust optimization (DRO) method has been used to model the uncertain behavior of RES in NMGs, SPLs, and the EDN. In addition, the impact of applying smart charging strategies for electric vehicles (EV) in the proposed P2P transactive energy model has been investigated. To confirm the functionality of the model, 12-bus, 6-bus, and 4-bus networks have been used to model NMGs, while the EDN is embodied by a standard IEEE 33-bus and 123-bus test systems.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Operating Envelope-Enabled P2P Trading to Maximize Financial Returns of Prosumers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10188896</link><description>This paper presents a new dynamic operating envelope (DOE)-integrated peer-to-peer (P2P) trading scheme to increase the exchange of electricity from prosumers to a distribution network without jeopardising the network constraints. First, a DOE computation mechanism is designed to estimate the power export and import limits for prosumers at different time slots. Second, considering the DOE-estimated export and import limits, a network-aware P2P trading framework is developed utilising cooperative game theory. The key properties of the P2P coalition are studied, as well as the incentive-compatibility and stability are also confirmed. Finally, an algorithm is proposed that enables prosumers to form a stable and incentive-compatible network-aware P2P coalition and fairly distribute the total coalition benefit among themselves. With extensive simulations, it is demonstrated that the modelled P2P trading structure allows prosumers to export more electricity to the low-voltage (LV) network safely compared to existing techniques while keeping bus voltages and line loading within acceptable margins. Subsequently, by trading more power locally, prosumers can substantially mitigate their electricity costs.</description></item><item><title>A Federated Byzantine Agreement Model to Operate Offline Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227349</link><description>Providing equitable and resilient electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) to remote locations with limited access to the Internet infrastructure is one of the paradoxes in the decarbonization plan. In this paper, we develop an electric vehicle (EV) charging management system comprised of offline EVSEs based on a Federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) system. To enable offline peer-to-peer (P2P) authentication between the user&#8217;s device (UD) and EVSE stations, we use a distributed certificate management based on Shamir&#8217;s algorithm and blind signing approach using the ring signature. We introduce extended FBA for charge point operator (FBA-CPO) systems and include explicit operational functions to ensure the ledger dissemination and scalability of the network. We specifically employ a pre-authorized mechanism for deferral vouchers using a pre-signed and weighted signing method. In the FBA-CPO network, each charger records all transactions on a local ledger and publicly publishes ledgers through random UD nodes. Under a generalization of the property of the federated quorum system, the proposed approach could provide a reliable network centrality with or without offline EVSEs. Eventually, we examined the performance of the proposed model using a system of real devices and their digital twins. Results show the FBA-CPO satisfies all functional and cross-cutting requirements for a consistent transnational mechanism.</description></item><item><title>Virtual Power Plants Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading in Unbalanced Distribution Networks: A Distributed Robust Approach Against Communication Failures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10229177</link><description>In recent years, virtual power plants (VPPs) have been undergoing a rapid development to aggregate mushrooming distributed energy resources. In this paper, a distributed robust algorithm for VPPs&#8217; peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading is proposed which can improve the robustness against communication failures such as packet losses and computing node failures in the cyber layer. Firstly, a P2P energy trading framework suitable for VPPs located in the unbalanced distribution network managed by the distribution system operator (DSO) is proposed, which is a bi-level problem with the DSO standing at the higher level to solve the power flow model and VPP operators (VPPOs) following at the lower level to decide the bilateral trading quantity and prices. Herein, an enhanced linearized DistFlow model is developed to address the unbalanced distribution network. Then, a distributed algorithm wherein the DSO and VPPOs engage in an iterative negotiation process based on relaxed alternating direction method of multipliers (R-ADMM) is derived, which renders the VPPOs&#8217; parallel computation and preserves privacy. Furthermore, a robust version of the algorithm against communication failures (DRAACF) is developed. The economy, robustness, computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach are validated by simulation analyses based on the modified IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus distribution networks.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Cryptography-Based Architecture to Achieve Secure Energy Trading in Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10179950</link><description>With the advancement of distributed generation and information technology, energy trading in micro grid (MG) becomes popular in recent years. However, due to the lack of authority management in the MG, the traditional energy trading method with trusted system operator (SO) and market operator (MO) is no longer suitable. This paper proposes a novel, secure and privacy-preserving energy trading architecture with the state-of-the-art cryptosystem. Firstly, a zero-knowledge-proof based non-interactive protocol is proposed to authenticate prosumers. Next, a novel energy data evaluation method is proposed to achieve privacy-preserving power pricing and dispatching with the homomorphic encryption. Moreover, a lightweight tree-chained trading book is proposed to protect the transaction information. Then, we analysis the security performance and emphasize the advantages of our proposed architecture. At last, we exam the performance of our proposed methods in the IEEE benchmark systems. We observe that, our proposed architecture could achieve the privacy-preserving and secure energy trading in a low-time-cost but high-accuracy way.</description></item><item><title>Adversarial Dynamic Load-Altering Cyberattacks Against Peak Shaving Using Residential Electric Water Heaters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10197626</link><description>Innovative smart grid technologies such as demand-side management (DSM) and smart home systems promise more optimal energy consumption; however, they expose the grid to load-altering cyberattacks wherein adversaries take control of customers&#8217; connected high-wattage appliances and consequently induce harmful load fluctuations. In this article, we present a novel adversarial machine learning algorithm powered by black-box optimization to synthesize stealthy dynamic load-altering attacks aiming at evading existing intrusion detection measures while maximizing the damage inflicted on the grid. The proposed algorithm is applied on a case study involving peak shaving using direct load control of residential electric water heaters. It is capable of designing stealthy attacks that can increase the detectors&#8217; misclassification probability by up to 44%. It can also be adapted to other load-altering attacks involving different DSM programs or other classes of loads. The algorithm can be used by electric power utilities to evaluate and harden the robustness of their cybersecurity solutions.</description></item><item><title>A General Real-Time Cyberattack Risk Assessment Method for Distribution Network Involving the Influence of Feeder Automation System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10226606</link><description>The power system has become the key target of national cyber confrontation. To enhance the risk management capability of the distribution network (DN) while assessing the cyberattack risk quickly and accurately, this paper proposes a general real-time cyberattack risk assessment method for DN involving the influence of distributed feeder automation systems (DFAs). In particular, to clarify the quantitative relationship between cyberattack intrusion and DN state deterioration, we constructed the quantitative model of the cyber physical distribution network (CPDN) under cyberattack, which involves the influence of DFAs&#8217; behavior. In addition, in order to intuitively demonstrate the cyberattack risk, we developed a novel entropy-like risk assessment system upon the quantitative model of CPDN. The real two-feeder test platform with cyberattack simulation devices is used to verify the correctness and practicality of the proposed method. In this process, a digital cyberattack risk assessment unit is created, contributing to the system-level application of risk management.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Event-Based Resilient Secondary Control for AC Microgrids: A Trust-Reputation Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10210689</link><description>A new resilient distributed secondary control for AC microgrids is studied based on event-triggered mechanisms and trust-reputation evaluation methods. When distributed generators (DGs) in a microgrid are subject to attacks, their transmitted state information would be tampered and thus affect the dynamics of normal generators. In order to isolate possible attacks, two types of trust evaluation metrics with different attack indices and time scales are designed, by which the performance of neighboring DGs can be assessed for specific practical demands. Based on the trust values of each neighbor, a reputation-propagation method is introduced at triggered time instants to determine whether a DG is under attack by comprehensively incorporating the opinion of mutual neighbors. The dynamic updating law of the communication edge weights is utilized with the derived reputation values. Based on this, a distributed Zeno-free event-triggered control protocols for voltage/frequency restoration and active power sharing are proposed. Sufficient conditions for picking proper control parameters are given in the main theorem. Lastly, the simulations are conducted in MATLAB/SimPowerSystems for several scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Online Recursive Detection and Adaptive Fuzzy Mitigation of Cyber-Physical Attacks Targeting Topology of IMG: An LFC Case Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10215089</link><description>Due to the low inertia of inverter-based islanded microgrids (IMGs), these systems require a delicate and accurate load frequency control (LFC) scheme. The deployment of such a control scheme, which preserves the balance between the load and generation, needs a cyber layer on top of the physical system that makes IMGs an appealing target for a variety of cyber-physical attacks (CPAs). Among these CPAs, there is a family of malicious CPAs whose aim is to compromise the LFC scheme by changing the topology of IMG and its parameters. On this basis, an online system identification method is developed to estimate the parameters of IMG using the recursive least square forgetting factor (RLS-FF) approach. Then, based on the estimated parameters, an anomaly-based intrusion detection system (IDS) is developed to identify CPAs and distinguish them from the uncertainties in the normal operation of IMG. Following anomaly detection, a mitigation scheme is proposed to regulate the IMG&#8217;s frequency using an adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy logic controller (IT2FLC). The proposed IT2FLC uses different types of distributed energy resources (DERs)&#8212;i.e., tidal power plants and solar panels which are, respectively, equipped with inertia emulation and droop-based controllers&#8212;to improve the frequency excursion resulting from CPAs. The simulation results verify the performance of the developed detection and mitigation schemes, particularly when the RLS-FF parameters, i.e., forgetting factor, covariance matrix, and reset parameter, are obtained through the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm. Furthermore, the designed mitigation scheme is corroborated by comparing its performance with several well-known attack-resilient control frameworks in LFC studies, e.g., linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and  $H_{\infty }$ , using real-time simulations.</description></item><item><title>Matrix-Completion-Based False Data Injection Attacks Against Machine Learning Detectors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10231128</link><description>False data injection (FDI) attacks can manipulate power system measurements, leading to system economic losses and security issues. Although machine-learning (ML) detectors can effectively detect FDI attacks, the current methods used to construct FDI attacks do not take into account the presence of ML detectors. To tackle this problem, we propose novel convex matrix-completion-based FDI (MC-FDI) attacks on DC and AC power flow models from an attacker&#8217;s perspective, accounting for the temporal correlation between compromised and historical measurements. The proposed attacks minimize the nuclear norm of the compromised measurement matrix to make the compromised measurement consistent with the historical measurements, and also maximize the L1-norm of the incremental voltage angle to ensure a sufficient negative impact on the power system operation. Moving target defense (MTD) is proposed to detect the proposed MC-FDI attacks from the defender&#8217;s standpoint. The idea is to actively change the line impedance to corrupt the spatial and temporal correlation of the compromised measurements in the MC-FDI attacks. Numerical results on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems show the stealthiness of the proposed attacks to both the Chi-square detector and ML detectors as well as the efficacy of MTD in detecting the MC-FDI attacks.</description></item><item><title>Design and Defense of Modal Resonance-Oriented Cyber-Attack Against Wide-Area Damping Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10250853</link><description>Most existing cyber-attacks are steady state-oriented attacks, not dynamic ones. Moreover, dynamic modal interaction between cyber layers and physical layers is not considered in current studies. This paper firstly proposes a novel modal resonance-oriented cyber-attack (MROCA) against wide-area damping control (WADC). MROCA, as a dynamic cyber-attack, analyzes the signal sent to WADC in the cyber layer and then estimates the critical oscillation mode of the physical layer without acquiring the system parameters. Then MROCA is designed to stimulate the open-loop modal resonance between the virtual oscillation mode of MROCA and the critical mode of the physical layer, thereby degrading the stability of cyber-physical power systems (CPPSs). Furthermore, the connection between MROCA and typical cyber-attacks is investigated, and the impact of MROCA on the stability of CPPSs is quantified by the modal movement with respect to the parameters of MROCA. Additionally, the corresponding defense strategy is proposed to inject the signal corresponding to the reverse mode of MROCA, thereby offsetting the negative impact of attacks. Finally, the proposed work is tested in the IEEE 39-bus benchmark system and the practical provincial power system. Simulation results indicate that the proposed MROCA will excite the open-loop modal resonance and reduce the stability of CPPS. The proposed defense strategy can accurately estimate the injected mode signal and ensure system stability when the system is attacked by MROCA.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Source Data Aggregation and Real-Time Anomaly Classification and Localization in Power Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10253676</link><description>This paper proposes a real-time anomaly location and classification framework for power distribution systems to simultaneously determine the type of anomaly (i.e., short-circuit fault, cyber attack, DER switching) and its location. The proposed framework employs the data aggregation module to collect the measurement data from multiple field devices operating at different sampling rates, such as protection relays and D-PMUs. The output of the data aggregation is then fed into a multi-task learning-based long-based short-term memory (MTL-LSTM) to classify the type of anomaly and the location in two separate tasks. The proposed MTL-LSTM approach can be utilized in real-time operation in order to distinguish between normal and several anomalous operations and locate the anomaly. The proposed framework is tested on a modified IEEE 33-bus test feeder benchmark that integrates solar generation and energy storage. The results show that the proposed framework can locate and classify anomalies for several operation conditions with more than 96% accuracy. Further experiments highlight the impact of aggregating multiple sources of data on the performance of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Enabling Efficient and Malicious Secure Data Aggregation in Smart Grid With False Data Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10254595</link><description>As the next-generation power grid, the smart grid has significantly improved dependability, flexibility, and efficiency compared with the traditional power grid. However, due to increasingly diverse application requirements, it faces challenges on balancing data privacy, efficiency, and robustness. In this paper, we present a fog computing-based smart grid model. In addition, based on the proposed model, we construct an efficient and privacy-preserving scheme that supports malicious secure smart grid usage data aggregation communication. To our best knowledge, this is the first concrete smart grid solution that concurrently achieves secure aggregation communication, data privacy, and data robustness (e.g., false data detection). Specifically, benefiting from Boolean/Arithmetic secret-sharing methods, our proposed scheme allows home users to report their electricity usage data to the cloud and fogs securely. Besides, a false data detection protocol is proposed to resist false data injection attacks launched by malicious home users. Theoretical analysis and experimental implementation show that our scheme efficiently achieves data security, anonymity, and robustness.</description></item><item><title>Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis in Power Electronic Networks: Informative Leverage and Multivariate Functional Clustering Approaches</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292588</link><description>We propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection and diagnosis algorithm in power electronic networks. Since most anomaly detection and diagnosis algorithms in the literature are based on supervised methods that can hardly be generalized to broader scenarios, we propose unsupervised algorithms. Our algorithm extracts the Time-Frequency Domain (TFD) features from the three-phase currents and three-phase voltages of the point of coupling (PCC) nodes to detect anomalies and distinguish between different types of anomalies, such as cyber-attacks and physical faults. To detect anomalies through TFD features, we propose a novel Informative Leveraging for Anomaly Detection (ILAD) algorithm. The proposed unsupervised ILAD algorithm automatically extracts noise-reduced anomalous signals, resulting in more accurate anomaly detection results than other score-based methods. To assign anomaly types for anomaly diagnosis, we apply a novel Multivariate Functional Principal Component Analysis (MFPCA) clustering method. Unlike the deep learning methods, the MFPCA clustering method does not require labels for training and provides more accurate results than other deep embedding-based clustering approaches. Furthermore, it is even comparable to supervised algorithms in both offline and online experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed unsupervised framework accomplishing anomaly detection and anomaly diagnosis tasks is the first of its kind in power electronic networks.</description></item><item><title>Quantile-Mixer: A Novel Deep Learning Approach for Probabilistic Short-Term Load Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10171210</link><description>As the power grid becomes more complex and dynamic, accurate short-term load forecasting (STLF) with probabilistic information is a prerequisite for various smart grid applications. For doing this, various deep learning models have been proposed, and recent models increase model size and complexity to achieve better accuracy which could also increase the burden on model design, computation time, and resources. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning model for accurate and efficient probabilistic STLF (PSTLF). First, we develop an STLF model utilizing the multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-mixer structure, i.e., MLP-mixer for STLF (MM-STLF), that has an advantage in forecasting accuracy and efficiency compared to the other deep learning models. Then, we propose a random quantile regression (RQR) method that takes a cumulative probability  $\tau $  as an input to the model and is trained on random  $\tau \text{s}$ . By combining MM-STLF and RQR, we develop a novel deep-PSTLF model, namely quantile-mixer (Q-mixer). We evaluate the overall performance of the proposed model with seven load datasets in terms of prediction error, model size, and inference time, respectively. Through experiments, various STLF models and probabilistic forecasting methods are compared, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Q-mixer in load forecasting.</description></item><item><title>A Contextual Bandit Approach for Value-Oriented Prediction Interval Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185994</link><description>Prediction interval (PI) is an effective tool to quantify uncertainty and usually serves as an input to downstream robust optimization. Traditional approaches focus on improving the quality of PI in the view of statistical scores and assume the improvement in quality will lead to a higher value in the power systems operation. However, such an assumption cannot always hold in practice. In this paper, we propose a value-oriented PI forecasting approach, which aims at reducing operational costs in downstream operations. For that, it is required to issue PIs with the guidance of operational costs in robust optimization, which is addressed within the contextual bandit framework here. Concretely, the agent is used to select the optimal quantile proportion, while the environment reveals the costs in operations as rewards to the agent. As such, the agent can learn the policy of quantile proportion selection for minimizing the operational cost. The numerical study regarding the day-ahead and real-time operation of a virtual power plant verifies the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of operational value. And it is especially evident in the context of extensive penetration of wind power.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Feedback Linearization Control of Distributed Energy Resources Using Sparse Regression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10190751</link><description>A complex physics-based modeling procedure and the uncertainty and confidentiality of internal parameters of distributed energy resources (DERs) motivate system identification tools for control purposes in smart grids. This paper develops a framework for data-driven nonlinear modeling and control of DERs using sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). Using the proposed data-driven model for closed-loop control, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a model-free design in stability analysis of DERs in smart grids. Feedback linearization control of DERs was chosen over conventional vector control in this research due to its superior capability of accounting for DER nonlinearities and weak AC grid integration. Compared with existing physics-based designs that heavily rely on knowing the detailed system dynamics or uninterpretable data-driven designs that rely on large historical data, the proposed model-free DER identification and control framework can accurately capture the dynamics of the DERs based on available measurements and provide guaranteed performance for black-start, weak AC grid integration, microgrid integration, and stability analysis. Real-time and offline simulations in addition to a detailed eigenvalue analysis are conducted to compare the effectiveness of the proposed data-driven approach with physics-based controllers.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Joint Regulations of Frequency and Voltage for TSO-DSO Coordination: A Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10208157</link><description>The increasing scale of distributed energy resources (DERs) in the active distribution network (ADN) offers valuable opportunities for distribution system operators (DSOs) to assist transmission system operators (TSOs) in regulating operational issues and reducing overall operational costs. The paper proposes a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL)-based TSO-DSO coordination framework for jointly regulating the frequency and voltage measured at the grid supply point (GSP) of the transmission network (TN) with a sufficient utilization of control flexibility of converter-based DERs. To facilitate MADRL, a simple grid partitioning method is employed for the balanced partitioning of ADNs with the connectivity constraint imposed on each sub-region. On this basis, a MADRL algorithm is designed by combining the QMIX and twin delayed deep deterministic policy (TD3) algorithm for an effective optimization of the decentralized regulation scheme. The proposed QMIX-TD3 is equipped with the graph convolutional network (GCN) for its temporal-spatial learning ability to tackle the challenges of the complicated transmission and distribution (T/D) system dynamics. In addition, a policy smooth regularization (PSR) loss is proposed to damp action oscillations and enhance sample efficiency. Experiments on the integrated T/D system demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively mitigate the impact of system disturbances and therefore benefit the system operation.</description></item><item><title>Receding-Horizon Chiller Operation Planning via Collaborative Neurodynamic Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10217176</link><description>Optimal chiller loading is crucial to reduce energy consumption in chiller operation planning. In existing methods for planning with heterogeneous chillers, minimum-up/down-time constraints are not imposed. This paper addresses receding-horizon chiller operation planning via collaborative neurodynamic optimization. A mixed-integer optimization problem with minimum-up/down-time constraints is formulated for receding-horizon chiller loading with heterogeneous chillers. It is then decomposed into a binary optimization subproblem and a global optimization subproblem, to facilitate the planning process. A neurodynamics-driven algorithm is proposed based on paired discrete Hopfield networks and projection neural networks to solve the subproblems alternatingly and iteratively. Experimental results based on the specifications of two chiller systems are elaborated to substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Preserving User Energy Consumption Profiling: From Theory to Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251453</link><description>The smart grid benefits and suffers from smart meter data. Proper use of massive data can improve energy services but may raise privacy concerns. For example, user energy consumption profiling, a classic method, can identify energy consumption patterns based on the collected load profiles from users. Thus, the privacy of these individual load profiles needs to be protected. However, most of the existing works focus on data transmission and calculation privacy, and often require additional computation, communication, or platform construction costs. In contrast, noise-injection-based data source privacy-protecting works can avoid such additional costs and provide theoretical differential privacy (DP) guarantee. This paper theoretically analyzes noise-injection-based user profiling mechanisms in terms of both privacy protection and accuracy. Specifically, we establish the privacy-accuracy trade-off. We then propose an optimal user energy consumption pattern estimation method for heterogeneous noise-injection-based data. Finally, we design a valid information ratio-based pricing scheme for noisy data that is independent of downstream tasks and easy to implement. Numerical studies based on field data confirm the effectiveness of our theoretical results.</description></item><item><title>MITS: Mobility-Aware Intelligent Task Scheduling in Vehicular Fog Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273770</link><description>Vehicular Fog Computing (VFC) has emerged as a captivating research paradigm to increase computing resources for Internet of Vehicles (IoV) applications. However, the allocation of the best possible computing resources is challenging due to the enormous growth of services in vehicular networks, such as augmented reality, 3-D gaming, autonomous driving, etc., and their severe delay limitations, processing demands, and mobility of vehicles. Mainly, achieving strict task latency is a challenging problem while vehicles traverse through the roadside unit (RSU) regions. In this work, the vehicle's task processing latency and energy consumption are considered by deciding which tasks should be scheduled to either the local RSU or the neighbour RSUs along the vehicle's path. We study the mobility-aware task scheduling problem to jointly optimize the service latency of the tasks and energy consumption of the vehicles. Initially, we employ the Markov renewal process (MRP) to model the vehicle's mobility. Subsequently, we establish that our proposed objective function is a monotone submodular function and provide a greedy heuristic for the maximization of the submodular function with an approximation of ($1-\frac{1}{\mathrm{e}}$). Further, we propose a hybrid optimization algorithm that combines particle swarm optimization (PSO) and simulated annealing (SA) algorithms to solve mobility-aware task scheduling problems for large-scale networks. We compare our proposed algorithm with existing mobility-aware scheduling approaches and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs efficiently for task scheduling problems.</description></item><item><title>Collaborative Computing Optimization in Train-Edge-Cloud-Based Smart Train Systems Using Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288258</link><description>With the advent of the intelligent and digital era, intelligent urban rail transit systems have been a research focus. As the core part of intelligent urban rail transit systems, smart trains are empowered by various intelligent applications. While improving system performance and reducing system risk, intelligent applications demand a large amount of computing power. However, it is challenging to provide simultaneously all intelligent applications for smart trains due to limited on-board computing resources. In this article, we design a train-edge-cloud (TEC) collaborative computing framework for train intelligent computing tasks. We aim to develop a TEC-based collaborative computing scheme to minimize the task processing delay with edge computing resource constraints. Considering the unique environment of smart train systems, we design a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to realize collaborative computing optimization. We design a novel risk function in the system by jointly considering the computing load of edge intelligence (EI) servers and the characteristics of the urban rail transit systems. Moreover, we optimize the proposed risk-sensitive RL algorithm by using quantum representation and functions to accelerate its convergence speed. We design the TEC-based collaborative computing framework and design the quantum-inspired risk-sensitive RL algorithm to formulate the strategies for task scheduling. Comprehensive simulation results indicate that the algorithm adopted in this article can significantly reduce the task processing delay while satisfying EI servers' computing resource constraints. The quantum-inspired-optimized risk-sensitive RL model dramatically improves the model convergence speed.</description></item><item><title>Predictive Recruitment in Vehicular Crowdsensing Based on Spatial Sensing Strength Analysis Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290938</link><description>Vehicular crowdsensing is an efficient method of data collection in cities, benefiting from the powerful moving and sensing capabilities of intelligent vehicles. Modeling sensing capacities of vehicles and analyzing sensing effect based on sensor setup schemes are crucial in vehicular crowdsensing system. If we can infer the sensing strength of vehicles towards surrounding spatial points in advance, it would facilitate the determination of which vehicles to recruit for uploading sensing data, thereby achieving uniform and wide sensing coverage. However, the sensing strength of vehicles is not considered in the current research due to the diversity of sensors deployed on vehicles and the complexity of spatial relationships among vehicles in actual traffic scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a predictive vehicle recruitment method based on spatial sensing strength analysis. First, a fine-grained method is proposed to analyze the sensing strength of vehicles with different sensor setup schemes at various points in space. We fuse the sensing results of multiple vehicles and design novel metrics to evaluate the overall sensing effect, which comprehensively consider sensing strength, uniformity, and coverage ratio. The proposed method innovatively combines the perceptual properties of actual sensors and the complex spatiotemporal relationships among vehicles. Then, to guarantee the timeliness of recruiting vehicles, we distinguish moving modes to predict vehicle movements and further obtain the spatial sensing strength of vehicles at a specific moment in the future. Furthermore, combined with the sensing and communicating capabilities of the roadside infrastructure, the vehicle recruitment problem is described as an optimization problem under multiple practical constraints. To address this problem, an online heuristic algorithm is proposed based on the predicted vehicles' sensing strength. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations based on a real dataset to visualize vehicle sensing effect and verify the superiority of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Joint Communication and Control Optimization of a UAV-Assisted Multi-Vehicle Platooning System in Uncertain Communication Environment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304322</link><description>In the context of intelligent and networked transportation, vehicle platoon control technology is an essential measure for improving overall vehicle traffic efficiency, reducing driving energy consumption, increasing driver comfort and driving safety, and easing traffic congestion. However, in high-speed mobile states, vehicles face an uncertain communication environment, making it difficult to meet the demand for multi-vehicle cooperative control. To address the existing research deficiencies, this paper investigates a UAV-assisted multi-vehicle cooperative platoon system. The paper aims to improve the communication success probability between vehicles and UAV nodes while mitigating the velocity perturbations generated by the platoon during travel. Specifically, we design a platoon controller based on a discrete double integral model and a joint optimization model for resource scheduling of air-ground communication. This model can flexibly adjust the communication resource allocation of each platooning vehicle within each timeslot according to the communication link. Due to the complex coupling between the variables of the objective function and the constraints of the optimization problem, we design an optimization iterative solution method based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP). Finally, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed joint optimization method through simulation experiments compared to benchmark methods.</description></item><item><title>Traffic Information-Based Hierarchical Control Strategies for Eco-Driving of Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292883</link><description>The development of intelligent transportation technology provides a great opportunity for energy efficiency improvement of electrified vehicles. However, for plug-in hybrid vehicles, eco-driving control usually involves three problems, including speed planning, SOC planning, and energy management. Solving the above three problems requires considering not only the fuel economy but also the computational efficiency. To this end, this paper proposes a hierarchical control strategy to improve driving comfort and fuel economy simultaneously for a PHEV. Specifically, three main contributions are presented to distinguish our efforts from the existing research. First, in the control framework, the traffic light information is utilized to calculate optimal driving speed by minimizing a multi-objective function. Then, the SOC planning problem is solved by convex optimization, while the fuel consumption is minimized by a predictive equivalent consumption minimization strategy. Second, the speed trajectories and fuel consumptions in the other two traffic scenarios with different traffic light SPaT (Signal Phasing and Timing) are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, the robustness with respect to prediction horizon length, initial co-state value, and gain coefficient value are analyzed and discussed.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Adaptive Fault-Tolerant Control for High-Speed Trains Using Multi-Agent System Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301690</link><description>In this paper, the speed and position tracking problem of high-speed trains is investigated in the presence of actuator faults. A multi-agent system model is constructed, where each vehicle of the train is regarded as a controllable agent. A distributed adaptive controller is then proposed for healthy train system based on terminal sliding mode control. Further, a distributed adaptive fault-tolerant controller (DAFC) is designed for high-speed trains considering actuator faults, and an auxiliary system is introduced to cope with the influence of input saturation. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the distributed fault-tolerant control is considered in a multi-agent system model, which can better utilize the residual power of each vehicle when actuator faults occur. The stability of the closed-loop control system is analyzed through Lyapunov theory, and it is proven that the speed and position tracking errors of all vehicles are cooperative convergence. The simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DAFC. Compared with the existing method, the proposed DAFC reduces the average speed and position control errors by 54.3$\%$ and 55$\%$, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Four-Wheel Independent Drive Vehicle Fault Tolerant Strategy Using Stochastic Model Predictive Control With Model Parameter Uncertainties</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287580</link><description>With the popularity and increasing demand of new energy automotive, four-wheel independent drive electric vehicles (4WID-EVs) and its distributed control mode is promising to be a better chassis architecture for its flexibility and maneuverability. However, due to the uncertainty of the vehicle internal time-varying parameters and imprecise fault detection method, a novel robust fault estimator-based stochastic model predictive control (SMPC) is proposed in this article to ensure the vehicle lateral motion control and track the desired longitudinal velocity considering the estimation error of motor failure degree. Firstly, a robust H-infinity fault estimator with a linear parameter-varying (LPV) model is established to estimate the real-time fault signal considering the external disturbance and parameter perturbation (i.g. longitudinal and lateral vehicle speed). Then, a SMPC controller framework is developed to alleviate the effect of inevitable evaluated estimation error while the vehicle lateral safety and vehicle speed tracking can be ensured. Finally, the hardware-in-loop (HIL) tests are conducted to prove the feasibility of SMPC controller. The experiment results indicate that the proposed controller framework can effectively preserve vehicle stability and keep vehicle in a healthy state with faster response compared with the traditional fault-tolerant controller.</description></item><item><title>An Electric Vehicle-Oriented Approach for Battery Multi-Constraint State of Power Estimation Under Constant Power Operations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10274132</link><description>State of power (SOP) reflects the peak power capability of a lithium-ion battery (LIB). Constant power (CP) operation (e.g., discharge or charge) is more representative of actual battery loadings in electric vehicle (EV) applications (e.g., EV acceleration, gradient climbing and regenerative braking) than constant current or constant voltage operation. However, relevant research on CP-based SOP estimation for LIBs in EVs is still rare. In this article, a novel model switching-based iterative algorithm is proposed for multi-constraint SOP estimation under a CP operation scenario. Two state-space models with implicit representations are constructed to describe the indirect relationships between a given CP over a prediction window and the maximum look-ahead current/voltage at the end of this window. An unscented Kalman filter-based correction strategy is applied to determine the dominant limitation factor so as to pinpoint battery SOP in high fidelity. Moreover, a SOP testing approach is designed to calibrate reference SOPs in high precision for validations.

In particular, the commercial vehicle requires an electrical-powered multiple motor based steering system generating large steering torque, which can replace the existing hydraulic steering one. However, the control of such system become more complicate than controlling of a single actuator and must deal with the unavoidable non-synchronous nature of multiple motors. In line with the trends and issues, many automobile manufacturers are currently paying attention to the robust and efficient motion controls of a dual-motor driving steer-by-wire (DSBW). Therefore, we proposed a novel synchronous motion control system of DSBW using passive decomposition and sliding mode control (SMC) techniques guaranteeing the passivity and robustness of the overall synchronized motion. Furthermore, the performance of proposed control system is validated through HILS of an actual DSBW using a developed vehicle model and an optimal finite preview control (OFPC) scheme tracking a specific test scenario, Double Lane Change (DLC). It is found that the motor-to-motor synchronization error and tracking one for the target reference trajectory are less than 1 degree, which sufficiently meets the requirement of automobiles manufacture company and is comparable to other existing approaches. We also investigated the tracking performance of the control system based on the different steering characteristics of OFPCs generated by the several preview times. Moreover, we investigated the tolerance level of proposed technique (without any additional FTC) against a partial fault condition in one of the motors and compared it with other control schemes in terms of tracking performance. This work will be valuable asset for those who wish to design the robust synchronous motion control of DSBW and construct the corresponding HILS of system considering different steering characteristics.</description></item><item><title>Triple-Active Bridge-Based Dynamic Power Balancing Solution for Minimizing Overdesigning in Military Aircraft Power System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275060</link><description>Military aircraft are an excellent example of custom-designed power grids, powering a mix of both steady and transient intermittent loads. The electrical power system (EPS) in military aircraft like F-35, consists of two sets of 270 V-HVDC buses powering these loads. During real-time operation, switching in of these intermittent loads will lead to unequal loading of HVDC buses, resulting in overloading/underloading of HVDC buses and higher conduction losses on the overloaded bus. For satisfactory performance, both the HVDC buses in the EPS are overdesigned. This anomaly arises because, in the current architecture, there is no provision for controlled power exchange between the two HVDC buses. This article proposes a novel Triple-Active Bridge (TAB) converter-based solution to address this concern without adding extra weight to the overall system. To achieve optimal performance and operational efficiency for bidirectional power flow in HVDC buses, a novel decoupled current control integrated with duty-cycle optimization is proposed. Simulation results validating the decoupled bidirectional power flow control are presented in detail. Compared to conventional control (phase-control alone), the proposed algorithm results in at least a 30% reduction in conduction losses. A 1&#8201;kW hardware prototype is developed, and experimental results showing bidirectional power flow and higher operating efficiency are demonstrated.</description></item><item><title>A Rolling Convergent Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy for Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285067</link><description>Energy management strategy (EMS) is regarded as a crucial measure to further leverage the benefits of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). However, existing EMSs often fail to balance applicability and optimality. As a widely recognized instantaneous optimization strategy, equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS) is considered to be competitive to achieve the desired performance, provided that equivalent factor (EF) is properly tuned. To achieve this goal, a rolling convergent ECMS for energy management of PHEV is proposed in this article. Instead of seeking the instantaneous solution solely from two-dimensional scale like traditional ECMS, this article extends the analysis to three-dimensional global scale. And the analytic expression of the optimal EF initial interval is derived, which can be quantitatively described by the component specifications of PHEV and driving condition information. Subsequently, inheriting the obtained optimal EF initial interval, a rolling convergent method using tabu search is developed for more efficient optimization. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified by simulation and experiment. The results show that the proposed strategy improves the fuel economy of PHEV by 3.7% and 5.2% over that using the traditional adaptive ECMS under two real-world driving cycles, respectively. And the validity of the optimal EF initial interval is corroborated under several typical driving cycles. Furthermore, the proposed strategy is performed on the test bench, demonstrating its superiority and practicality.</description></item><item><title>Cyclic Impulse Spectrum Analysis of Time-Frequency Slices for Axle-Box Bearing Fault Identification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294216</link><description>For the incipient fault weakness, irregular pulse disturbance, and pseudo-cyclic periodicity of localized damage impact in the fault diagnosis of axle-box bearing (ABB) under complex service environments, the cyclic impulse spectrum (CIS) based on time-frequency spectrogram slicing is proposed to discriminate repetitive transients under noise contamination. In this approach, a new indicator called the cyclic impulse degree (CID) is designed based on the coefficient of variation of the impulse peak moment within a specified time-shifted periodic window, which allows for a generalization of impulsiveness and pseudo-cyclic periodicity to quantify the characteristics of bearing fault impacts. First, the normalized S transform (NST) highlights the energy distribution of fault impacts in the time&#8211;frequency plane, from which the CID is constructed to distinguish the cyclic impulses from random transients. Secondly, the NST slice at the frequency associated with the maximum integrated CID is used as a spare representation of fault impact response. Finally, the CIS derived from the NST slice presents the fault characteristic frequencies clearly and accurately. The numerical simulation and data processing results of the ABB faults demonstrated that the CIS can identify the multiple faults of ABB, but also exhibits good performance in resisting random transient interference and discriminating noise-contaminated periodic impulses caused by the bearing localized defects.</description></item><item><title>Simultaneous Estimation and Receding Horizon Sliding Control of Dog Clutch Coupling With Backlash for Rear Electrical Drivelines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294311</link><description>Compared to friction clutches, dog clutches have the advantages of high efficiency, small size, low cost, and large transmission torque; therefore, they are selected for use in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) with a single electric motor (EM) driving the rear axle. In the dog clutch coupling process, the meshing of the teeth produces an impact, and dynamic control of the clutch faces problems of backlash and flexible shaft control. For an advanced dynamic study and subsequent improved performance, a novel dynamic estimation algorithm is proposed. This algorithm includes an observer for estimating the clutch torque, two piecewise-affine (PWA) estimators for estimating the torsion angle and half-shaft torque, and a state machine for indicating the backlash position. To demonstrate its feasibility, the convergence rate and observation error are investigated. Based on the information obtained through dynamic estimation, a second-order receding horizon sliding control (RHSC) approach is proposed. In dog clutch coupling, the speed deviation and tracing torque set points, which correspond to different backlash positions, are the control targets. Based on the second-order sliding mode structure, an optimization algorithm is developed and its convergence is studied. The performance of the estimator and control method is verified through road tests. The results show that the estimator can correctly indicate the system state and that the control method can improve the performance of the powertrain.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Regenerative Braking Control Strategy for Electric Vehicles Based on Braking Intention Recognition and Load Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298604</link><description>Regenerative braking technology plays a crucial role in recovering braking energy and extending the range of electric vehicles. To maximize energy recovery and ensure braking stability across various road conditions, loads, and braking intentions, an optimal regenerative braking control strategy is proposed. Firstly, the driver's braking intention is recognized using optimized modal features extracted from the brake pedal signal. Vehicle load estimation is then performed using a forgetting factor recursive least squares algorithm. Subsequently, an artificial bee colony optimization algorithm is employed to allocate optimal braking forces between the front and rear axles for different braking intentions and loads. Based on the obtained braking force distribution ratio, an optimal regenerative braking control strategy is developed, considering braking stability and energy recovery safety. The proposed strategy is validated on the dSPACE hard-in-loop platform under various simulated conditions, including different road conditions, braking intentions, and loads. The results demonstrate that braking intention, vehicle load, and road conditions all impact the regenerative braking process of electric vehicles. Moreover, the proposed regenerative braking control strategy significantly enhances the energy recovery rate and effectively reduces braking distance.</description></item><item><title>Imbalance Cost-Aware Energy Scheduling for Prosumers Towards UAM Charging: A Matching and Multi-Agent DRL Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301640</link><description>In this paper, an energy scheduling problem is formulated for the prosumer-based urban area, where prosumers are regarded as the drone charging stations for urban air mobility (UAM). Particularly, since electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft (eVTOL) is regarded as the anticipated technique for future UAM, we consider eVTOL drone taxis for transporting passengers. The objective is to minimize the overall energy supply-demand imbalance cost. This problem covers two aspects: 1) association between passengers and eVTOLs, and 2) energy balance strategy determination through power grid energy scheduling for each prosumer. For the first aspect, a destination collision-aware Gale-Shapely matching game (DC-MG) approach is proposed, where the distance concern of passengers, the remaining energy of eVTOLs, and the destination collision are comprehensively considered. Subsequently, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAGC)-based multi-agent dueling double deep Q network (MA3DQN) with a multi-step bootstrapping (MSB) approach (CMA3DQN) is proposed, where the input (i.e., energy demand) depends on the output of the first aspect. Particularly, the HAGC approach is adopted to group all prosumers into several agents to reduce the input feature size of each agent. Then the MA3DQN with MSB approach is applied to achieve the best grid energy balance strategy per prosumer. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Particularly, the imbalance cost achieved by the proposed joint method is separately $128.71\times$, $12.57\times$, and $11.72\times$ less than the random energy scheduling approach, the independent multi-agent dueling DQN approach, and the approach of employing the double deep Q network per cluster.</description></item><item><title>Performance Analysis of RIS-Assisted Full-Duplex Communication Over Correlated Nakagami-$m$ Fading Channel</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275022</link><description>In this article, we investigate the performance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted full-duplex (FD) communication network, where each user is facilitated by a specific RIS in the network. The correlated Nakagami-$m$ fading channel is first considered in a RIS system, which is a general channel model that can capture the spatial correlation effect inherent in the RIS-assisted communication system. Using the two-dimensional Laplace transform and its inverse, the closed form expressions of the mean and variance of the signal power distribution are obtained. Then, the outage probability and average achievable rates of the uplink and downlink users are derived in closed form. Furthermore, the impact of the residual self-interference (SI) on FD communication performance is discussed. It is demonstrated that FD communication outperforms HD communication when the residual SI is below a threshold, and the threshold is derived in closed form. Simulation results are presented to confirm the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and show the negative impact of channel correlation on the system performance. Moreover, it is illustrated that the outage probability and the average achievable rate of the uplink user will converge to a constant when the residual SI is linearly dependent on the transmit power.</description></item><item><title>Online Trajectory Optimization for Energy-Efficient Cellular-Connected UAVs With Map Reconstruction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275015</link><description>In this article, we leverage the outage probability knowledge map to characterize the connection between unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and cellular networks. The outage probability knowledge map is a database that simulates the connection between UAV and the cellular network during real hovers, which helps to enhance the UAV's awareness of the environment and reduce the connection interruption under complex real-time channel state information. We assume that the UAV roughly samples from the actual radio environment of the airspace in advance, and calculates the outage probability of the sampled points. After that, the UAV reconstructs the actual outage knowledge map, and flies in the airspace to learn the optimal UAV trajectory planning policy based on the reconstructed map. The optimization objective is to minimize the flight energy cost of the UAV performing tasks. In this article, we propose a deep image prior based radio map reconstruction (DIPRMR) method to reconstruct the map, and then propose a deep reinforcement learning based trajectory optimization algorithm. The UAV that performs the task adjusts the flight trajectory based on the outage probability knowledge obtained from the reconstructed complete map. Simulation results show that the proposed online trajectory optimization scheme based on outage probability knowledge map can obtain great returns in terms of maintaining connectivity, reducing task completion time and energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>Multifunctional Switched-Beam Antenna Located on Solar Cell for Vehicular to Satellite Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285606</link><description>In this article, a multifunctional beam forming architecture is studied in detail for intelligent transportation systems and advanced vehicular technologies.

This paper proposes a high-rate reflection STSK system based on a 3-D constellation and a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). To implement reflection phase shifting, a set of reflection dispersion matrices (RDMs) are constructed without power limit. To improve bandwidth efficiency, an additional phase is introduced to the selected 3-D constellation point and carries up to three bits. An upper bound for bit error rate (BER) is derived under maximum-likelihood (ML) detection. It is shown that both diversity gain and coding gain rely on the construction of the RDMs for the system. Accordingly, a genetic algorithm is proposed for randomly generating an optimal family of the RDMs and the additional phase parameter. Simulation results show that the proposed system can improve both bandwidth efficiency and power efficiency, when compared with the traditional 3-D STSK and RIS-based SSK-assisted Alamouti space-time block coding systems.</description></item><item><title>Throughput Maximization in Cellular Networks With Wireless Backhaul and Energy Harvesting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285397</link><description>This article investigates the throughput maximization problem in cellular networks where a macro cell is overlaid with multiple small cells, and each small-cell base station (sBS) provides data links for wireless backhaul and energy links for energy harvesting (EH) nodes. The data links enable communication between sBSs, while the energy links facilitate radio-frequency-based energy harvesting by EH nodes. Efficient scheduling of these links is crucial for enhancing network throughput while fulfilling the energy requirements of the EH nodes. To tackle this challenge, a mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP) and a minimizing power problem are formulated to derive a link schedule for both types of links with the minimum power consumption. However, obtaining the optimal schedule is challenging due to the complexity of the initial formulations. To address this, a practical problem decomposition method is proposed, along with a single-stage technique that simultaneously maximizes the number of scheduled data links and minimizes transmit power. The optimization process is further improved using benders decomposition (BD), complemented by the machine learning-aided multi-cut method for enhanced convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal link scheduling with reduced iterations. Numerical analysis validates the effectiveness of the problem decomposition method, particularly when the EH nodes have an energy requirement of 0.1 Joules.</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning-Enabled Joint Edge Content Caching and Power Allocation Strategy in Wireless Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286984</link><description>Edge content caching has emerged as a promising solution against network latency by pre-caching popular contents at the edge of networks. However, the edge content caching and wireless resource allocation are intertwined with each other. The content downloading latency depends not only on the edge content caching strategy, but also highly on the wireless resource allocation strategy. To cope with them as a whole, this work aims at jointly optimizing the edge content caching and power allocation to minimize the content downloading latency. In doing so, a joint edge content caching and power allocation problem is formulated. But, this problem is NP-hard and difficult to be solved. Solving it with the traditional approaches will cause quite long computational delay, which cannot meet the real-time requirements of resource scheduling. To address this challenge, a novel deep learning (DL)-enabled joint edge content caching and power allocation framework is proposed. In particular, the formulated problem is firstly transformed into a classification problem in DL field. After that, the convolutional long short-term memory networks (ConvLSTM) are utilized to capture the temporal-spatial features of content requests, and the fully-connected networks (FC) are introduced to explore the users' location differences. Finally, the temporal-spatial features of content requests and the location differences are fused to make intelligent decisions for joint edge content caching and power allocation. Simulation results show that the proposed joint edge content caching and power allocation strategy outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines at about 2.3% in terms of the average content downloading latency while guaranteeing real-time resource scheduling.</description></item><item><title>Learning Wireless Power Allocation Through Graph Convolutional Regression Networks Over Riemannian Manifolds</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286982</link><description>Optimum power allocation is a key enabler for maximizing data rate in wireless networks. Recently, various deep neural network models have been introduced for predicting power allocation in device-to-device (D2D) networks. However, they require large training samples (i.e., network layouts). On the contrary in this paper, we aim to develop a learning model for power allocation with fewer training samples, which is vital in dynamic networks (e.g., vehicular networks) with the need for fast learning of power allocation. The proposed model transforms Euclidean-based network layouts and power allocation problems into Riemannian (i.e., non-Euclidean) manifolds, which is shown to require fewer learning parameters and hence shorter learning time. Such transformation is possible thanks to the symmetric positive definite (SPD) property of spectral representation (i.e., Laplacian matrix) of network layouts. In particular, we propose a graph convolutional regression network (GCRN) for predicting power allocation over Riemannian manifolds in an unsupervised manner. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed GCRN model approaches the maximum network rate in large-scale networks, with only 300 training samples as opposed to 10,000 in Euclidean-based learning models.</description></item><item><title>Graph Neural Networks for Quality of Service Improvement in Interference-Limited Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288214</link><description>This paper aims to improve the Quality-of-Service (QoS) of Ultra-Reliability and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) in interference-limited wireless networks. To obtain time diversity within the channel coherence time, we first put forward a random repetition scheme that randomizes the interference power. Then, we optimize the number of reserved slots and the number of repetitions for each packet to minimize the QoS violation probability, defined as the percentage of users that cannot achieve URLLC. We build a cascaded Random Edge Graph Neural Network (REGNN) to represent the repetition scheme and develop a model-free unsupervised learning method to train it. To obtain some analytical results, we derive approximations of the QoS violation probability using stochastic geometry in a Poisson bipolar network and apply a model-based Exhaustive Search (ES) method to find the optimal repetition scheme. Based on the analytical results, a model-assisted initialization is developed for the cascaded REGNN to improve the training efficiency. Simulation results show that the cascaded REGNN can achieve a lower QoS violation probability than the cascaded fully connected neural network, and generalizes well in wireless networks with different scales, network topologies, cell densities, and frequency reuse factors.</description></item><item><title>Coexistence Designs of Radar and Communication Systems in a Multi-Path Scenario</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287644</link><description>The focus of this study is on the spectrum sharing between multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications and co-located MIMO radar systems in multi-path environments. The major challenge is to suppress the mutual interference between the two systems while combining the useful multi-path components received at each system. We tackle this challenge by jointly designing the communication precoder, radar transmit waveform and receive filter. Specifically, the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the radar receiver is maximized subject to constraints on the radar waveform, communication rate and transmit power. The multi-path propagation complicates the expressions of the radar SINR and communication rate, leading to a non-convex problem. To solve it, a sub-optimal algorithm based on the alternating maximization is used to optimize the precoder, radar transmit waveform and receive filter iteratively. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.</description></item><item><title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted High-Speed Train Communications: Coverage Performance Analysis and Placement Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287590</link><description>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) emerges as an efficient and promising technology for the next wireless generation networks and has attracted a lot of attention owing to the capability of extending wireless coverage by reflecting signals toward targeted receivers. In this paper, we consider a RIS-assisted high-speed train (HST) communication system to enhance wireless coverage and improve coverage probability. First, coverage performance of the downlink single-input-single-output system is investigated, and the closed-form expression of coverage probability is derived. Moreover, travel distance maximization problem is formulated to facilitate RIS discrete phase design and RIS placement optimization, which is subject to coverage probability constraint. Simulation results validate that better coverage performance and higher travel distance can be achieved with deployment of RIS. The impacts of some key system parameters including transmission power, signal-to-noise ratio threshold, number of RIS elements, number of RIS quantization bits, horizontal distance between base station and RIS, and speed of HST on system performance are investigated. In addition, it is found that RIS can well improve coverage probability with limited power consumption for HST communications.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Efficient Design for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Cell-Free Ultra Dense HetNets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290997</link><description>In this article, we investigate the energy efficiency (EE) of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) aided cell-free ultra-dense HetNets (CFUDN). To maximize the EE of CFUDN, users (UEs) association and clustering, RISs subsurface (SSF) associations are carefully designed. Then, the phase shift matrix of RISs and transmission power of base stations (BSs) are jointly optimized. Due to the non-convexity and high complexity of the formulated problem, this jointly optimized problem is usually difficult to solve. At present, the most commonly adopted method to deal with joint optimization problems is the block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm based on an alternative optimization framework. However, as we all know, the BCD algorithm has some degree of performance loss due to the alternate optimization of variables. To overcome this challenging issue, a novel joint optimization framework based on Riemannian product manifolds (RPM) is proposed, in which the phase shift matrix of RISs and transmission power of BSs can be simultaneously optimized rather than alternating ways. The simulation results and computational complexity analysis demonstrate that the joint optimization framework based on the RPM exhibits superior performance and lower complexity compared to the joint optimization algorithm based on the BCD.</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning Based Fingerprint Positioning for Multi-Cell Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292876</link><description>In this paper, we investigate user terminal (UT) fingerprint positioning for multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems in non-line-of-sight scenario. We first introduce a refined double beam-based channel model to the positioning problem and extract the energy coupling matrix in the refined beam domain as location-related fingerprint. By taking advantage of refined spatial and frequency beams, the new fingerprint (i.e., energy coupling matrix) contains plentiful and stationary multi-path information, such as power, angle of arrival (AoA), and delay of arrival (DoA), which are favorable to positioning. We then propose a novel deep learning-based fingerprint positioning method to locate the 2-dimension (2D) position of UTs, utilizing the multi-cell fingerprint as the input. In particular, we propose two deep neural network (DNN) architectures in this paper. The first DNN consists of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron, refining the elementary features from the multi-cell fingerprints and dividing the UTs into their belonging categories. In the second DNN, a new network architecture, Transformer, is applied to the positioning problem. The Transformer is directly based solely on self-attention mechanisms to sequences of fingerprint patches, which can perform outstandingly on the 2D position coordinates regression. Simulation results show that the proposed positioning methods can outperform the existing methods in terms of positioning error.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning-Aided Transmission Design for Dynamic Vehicular Communication Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292947</link><description>In a vehicular communication network, how to efficiently utilize the limited network resources to meet the stringent transmission quality of service (QoS) requirements in the dynamically changing environment is a challenging task. This paper studies a typical vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication scenario, in which multiple source nodes desire to deliver different types of messages to their respective destinations. Considering the case that accurate instantaneous global channel state information (CSI) is unavailable, properly selecting access channel, transmission power, and data rate at each source to optimize the links' performance is an extremely involved mixed-integer stochastic optimization problem. We propose applying the distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning technique to solve the problem. Specifically, a distributed multi-agent parameterized deep Q-network (DMA-PDQN) algorithm is employed to explore optimal decision in the discrete-continuous hybrid action space. The idea of federated meta learning (FML) is also adopted to tackle the non-stationarity issue and improve the training efficiency of distributed agents. Using energy efficiency (EE) as the target transmission objective, through extensive simulation we show that our method can achieve excellent convergence and performance.</description></item><item><title>Optimized Resource Allocation for Distributed Joint Radar-Communication System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292936</link><description>In this article, we consider a distributed joint radar-communication (JRC) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system that performs both radar and communication objectives simultaneously. By introducing radar and communication performance metrics, optimized power allocation is achieved for different transmitters of the JRC system. The objective of the radar subsystem is to achieve a desired target localization accuracy quantified in terms of the Cramer-Rao bound of the location estimates, whereas the objective of the communication subsystem is to improve the classical Shannon capacity. First, we consider non-cooperative radar- and communication-centric operations, and the power allocations are respectively optimized for these cases. Next, we present two novel resource allocation strategies for the cooperative JRC system. In the first strategy, joint resource optimization for radar and communication subsystems is performed by exploiting the same waveform resources, resulting in high spectrum efficiency. The second approach provides enhanced flexibility by exploiting separate sets of waveforms that are respectively dedicated to the radar and communication subsystems, enabling the JRC system to independently change radar subsystem waveforms based only on the radar surveillance profile, without impacting the communication subsystem waveforms. Simulation results clearly demonstrate significant performance gain of the proposed cooperative JRC system over radar- or communication-centric power allocation schemes.</description></item><item><title>Two-Layer Large Scale Fading Precoding for Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Performance Analysis and Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310167</link><description>In this paper, a two-layer large scale fading precoding (LSFP) method is proposed in a downlink cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system. In the first LSFP layer, the access points are responsible for designing distributed precoding and power control coefficients for each user equipment (UE). While for the second LSFP layer, the central processing unit performs the proposed zero forcing LSFP (ZF-LSFP) for the copilot UEs in order to mitigate the interference caused by pilot contamination. To address power constraints and enhance the system's spectral efficiency (SE), we introduce the copilot power scaling factors. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for the lower-bound achievable SE under distributed precoding schemes. These expressions are versatile and applicable to downlink SE irrespective of the availability of ZF-LSFP. Based on the derived closed-form results, we formulate a sum SE maximization problem with respect to copilot power scaling factors. Two approaches are designed to solve this problem, i.e. the weighted minimum mean square error (W-MMSE) based approach and the geometric programming (GP) based approach. While the W-MMSE-based approach is suitable for various systems, the GP-based approach is specifically tailored for systems with high signal-to-noise ratios, offering fast running speed. Finally, we validate all theoretical analyses and assess the effectiveness of the proposed two-layer LSFP method through numerical simulations.</description></item><item><title>Energy Efficiency Analysis and Optimization for Millimeter-Wave MIMO With Variable-Resolution ADCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301689</link><description>In millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, the surge in hardware cost and power consumption poses a huge challenge to green communication. Considering the high power consumption of the radio frequency (RF) module, we aim to design a high energy-efficient uplink multi-users (MU) communication system by applying variable-resolution analog to digital converters (ADC). Firstly, a closed-form expression for the spectrum efficiency (SE) in terms of the quantization resolution of ADC is derived under hybrid beamforming (HBF) and fully digital beamforming (FDBF) architectures, respectively. We find explicit energy efficiency (EE) expressions and investigate the main factors affecting EE under two kinds of architectures. For HBF, a novel finding is that adding the number of RF chains for a fixed number of transmit data streams can effectively mitigate the quantization distortion introduced by low-resolution ADCs. Furthermore, an EE maximization problem involving joint optimization of ADC bit selection and power allocation between MU for the HBF system is formulated. Based on the concept of block coordinate ascent (BCA), we subdivide the original problem into two subproblems. The first subproblem involves power allocation, which has been reformulated as a convex problem using an equivalent quadratic transformation. The second subproblem tackles ADC bit selection, for which we propose a low-complexity search scheme that achieves performance approaching that of an exhaustive search. The simulation results demonstrate the high accuracy of the derived closed-form expression, which supports the EE analysis. The proposed EE maximization scheme has a fast convergence rate and achieves higher EE compared to existing benchmark technologies.</description></item><item><title>OFDM-BOC: A Broadband Multicarrier Navigation Modulation-Based BOC for Future GNSS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301478</link><description>The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) is a critical infrastructure for positioning, navigation, and timing. Recently, vigorous implementation of low earth orbit (LEO) communication satellites has provided a new opportunity for developing GNSS. However, most of the existing navigation modulations are only applicable for narrow bandwidths; hence, broadband navigation modulation with good compatibility and scalability is needed. This paper presents a new broadband multicarrier navigation modulation, namely orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with binary offset carriers (OFDM-BOC), which uses orthogonal BOC signals as subcarriers. First, we derive the analytical expressions of the autocorrelation function (ACF) and power spectral density (PSD) based on the proposed signal model. Then, we discuss the relationship between the OFDM-BOC parameters and their time-frequency properties. This modulation can update existing BOC-like signals without affecting the original receiver. In addition, OFDM-BOC has a similar transmitter and receiver scheme to traditional modulation, so the update process only needs minor changes for the original navigation equipment. Compared with some representative navigation modulations such as AltBOC, BOC(10,5), and OFDM, the analysis reflects that OFDM-BOC has a flatter PSD main lobe, lower PSD maximum value, and smaller false lock probability. Moreover, it is shown that OFDM-BOC also has better spectrum efficiency, tracking performance, and anti-interference. Due to the excellent compatibility and navigation performance, OFDM-BOC provides a broadband modulation scheme for the next generation of navigation signals.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Hop Airborne FSO Systems With Relay Selection Over Outdated Log-Normal Turbulence Channels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301700</link><description>Due to its high capacity and the ability to operate in an unregulated spectrum, free space optical (FSO) communication is ideally suited for airborne backhauling. In this paper, we consider a relay-assisted airborne FSO system in which serial and parallel relaying are deployed together. We deploy relay selection in each hop and select the relay that provides the maximum instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To achieve this in practice, it is necessary to estimate the channel coefficient per hop and feed it back to the preceding transmitting/relaying node. Due to the semi-fixed hovering position of rotary-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), this estimate will likely be outdated for the airborne channel. Therefore, the relay will likely be selected based on the outdated channel coefficient. In this paper, we first propose a model for outdated log-normal fading. Based on the outdated channel state information, we discuss how to optimally set the node transmit power by a proper selection of the pre-amplification factor to ensure signal reception above a targeted threshold at each hop. We finally present the end-to-end bit error rate (BER) performance of the airborne parallel multi-hop system under consideration.</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning-Based Joint Optimization of Closed-Loop FDD mmWave Massive MIMO: Pilot Adaptation, CSI Feedback, and Beamforming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294218</link><description>To alleviate severe attenuation of millimeter-wave (mmWave) channel, massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) in which a large number of antennas are utilized in base station (BS) is a promising solution. However, due to a large number of antennas and limited coherence time of mmWave mobile channel, acquisition of a precise channel state information (CSI) requires a large channel estimation overhead, especially for frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. In addition, due to limited saturation level of mmWave power amplifiers, a flexible pilot length adaptation is required for mmWave communication systems. Likewise, because of a large number of BS antennas, it is difficult to feed back all CSI with high accuracy in FDD massive MIMO systems. There exists a trade-off between feedback overhead and the accuracy of recovered CSI. To resolve these issues, in this paper, we propose a deep learning-based joint optimization of closed-loop FDD massive MIMO systems. Unlike previous deep learning-based approach in which only beamforming (BF) from observation of CSI is composed with neural network, we formulate the entire process of generating BF matrix as a functional optimization problem. We compose a deep learning-based FDD massive MIMO system where the functional blocks including pilot length adaptation, CSI compression, and BF are replaced with neural networks. The neural networks are connected and trained as a single network toward a direction which maximizes network utility. During the training process, each functional block learns its best strategy to maximizes network utility. Through simulation, we confirm that each network learned strategies to maximize network utility by itself.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Multimedia Data Sharing in IoV: A Learning-Based Equilibrium of Supply and Demand</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10272628</link><description>The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has great potential to transform transportation systems by enhancing road safety, reducing traffic congestion, and improving user experience through onboard infotainment applications. Decentralized data sharing can improve security, privacy, reliability, and facilitate infotainment data sharing in IoVs. However, decentralized data sharing may not achieve the expected efficiency if there are IoV users who only want to consume the shared data but are not willing to contribute their own data to the community, resulting in incomplete information observed by other vehicles and infrastructure, which can introduce additional transmission latency. Therefore, in this article, by modeling the data sharing ecosystem as a data trading market, we propose a decentralized data-sharing incentive mechanism based on multi-intelligent reinforcement learning to learn the supply-demand balance in markets and minimize transmission latency. Our proposed mechanism takes into account the dynamic nature of IoV markets, which can experience frequent fluctuations in supply and demand. We propose a time-sensitive Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (KP-ABE) mechanism coupled with Named Data Networking (NDN) to protect data in IoVs, which adds a layer of security to our proposed solution. Additionally, we design a decentralized market for efficient data sharing in IoVs, where continuous double auctions are adopted. The proposed mechanism based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning can learn the supply-demand equilibrium in markets, thus improving the efficiency and sustainability of markets. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our proposed learning-based incentive mechanism outperforms baselines by 10% in determining the equilibrium of supply and demand while reducing transmission latency by 20%.</description></item><item><title>UAV-Aided Information Collection Method Based on Joint Optimization of Node Access and Flight Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275059</link><description>UAV-aided communication can utilize the line-of-sight transmission and strong mobility of UAVs to achieve efficient information collection for IoT nodes. However, in scenarios where IoT devices are sparsely distributed and small to medium data volumes are uploaded, the proportion of UAV flight energy consumption increases and the energy efficiency is low. To this end, a UAV-aided information collection method based on joint optimization of node access and flight strategy is proposed. The cost function is minimized by optimizing the speed of UAV, the average flight time and the access selection of IoT nodes. And the cost function consists of UAV energy consumption and total mission time. In order to effectively solve the non-convex term in the original optimization problem, the convex relaxation and successive convex approximation (SCA) technique is used to transform it into a mixed integer disciplined convex program (MIDCP), and an iterative algorithm is de-signed to solve this problem. The simulation results show that the proposed method can reduce the energy consumption and mission time of the UAV under the premise of ensuring the integrity of node information collection.</description></item><item><title>Energy Minimization of Inland Waterway USVs for IRS-Assisted Hybrid UAV-Terrestrial MEC Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285605</link><description>Due to its exceptional ability to create favorable line-of-sight (LoS) propagation environments, the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is widely recognized as a technological enabler for wireless inland waterway communications. In this article, an IRS-assisted hybrid unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-terrestrial network architecture with unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) is proposed and a USVs energy minimization problem is formulated by jointly considering offloading decisions, computation capability, beamforming vector design and IRS phase shift-vector. To address the formulated problem, we decouple the original problem into two subproblems, in which the first subproblem focuses on joint offloading decisions and computation capability and the second subproblem concerns joint IRS phase shift-vector and the beamforming vector design. The enhanced differential evolution algorithm (EDE) is proposed to solve the former subproblem, and the minimum-variance-distortionless-response (MVDR) and enhanced min-maximization (EMM) algorithms are proposed to obtain optimized beamforming vector and IRS phase shift-vector in the second subproblem, respectively. Simulation results show how the proposed solution realizes a good tradeoff between network energy consumption and capacity in comparison to three alternative algorithms. The results also show that the proposed algorithm can improve the network performance in terms of the number of successfully offloaded tasks.</description></item><item><title>Stochastic Geometry-Based Trajectory Design for Multi-Purpose UAVs: Package and Data Delivery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278445</link><description>With the advancements achieved in drones' flexibility, low cost, and high efficiency, they obtain huge application opportunities in various industries, such as aerial delivery and future communication networks. However, the increasing transportation needs and expansion of network capacity demands for UAVs will cause aerial traffic conflicts in the future. To address this issue, in this article, we explore the idea of multi-purpose UAVs, which act as aerial wireless communication data relays and means of aerial transportation simultaneously to deliver data and packages at the same time. While UAVs deliver the packages from warehouses to residential areas, we design their trajectories which enable them to collect data from multiple Internet of Things (IoT) clusters and forward the collected data to terrestrial base stations (TBSs). To select the serving nearby IoT clusters, UAVs rank them based on their priorities and distances. From the perspectives of data and package delivery, respectively, we propose two algorithms that design the optimal UAVs trajectory to maximize the transmitted data or minimize the round trip time. Specifically, we use tools from stochastic geometry to model the locations of IoT clusters and TBSs. Given the nature of random locations, the proposed algorithm applies to general cases. Our numerical results show that multi-purpose UAVs are practical and have great potential to enhance the energy/time-efficiency of future networks.</description></item><item><title>Joint Power Allocation and Task Replication for Reliability-Sensitive Services in NOMA-Enabled Vehicular Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297596</link><description>To cope with the increasing demands of computing tasks in vehicles, task offloading to computing nodes (vehicles and edge servers) in a vehicular edge computing (VEC) scenario has gained significant attention. However, the high dynamic of task arrival and variant wireless network conditions could severely impact the quality of computation offloading for latency-aware and high-reliability services. Consequently, only offloading tasks to a single computing node may fail to satisfy the reliability requirements due to potential transmission errors or constraints on delay. To mitigate the limitations of task offloading to only one single computing node in VEC, task replication, in which a task can be sent to multiple computing nodes simultaneously is utilized. Nevertheless, unrestricted task replication may exacerbate the depletion of network and computing resources in VEC when a burst of computing tasks is generated. To address the above challenges, we first formulate the problem of power allocation with task replication in NOMA-enabled VEC. Our purpose is to maximize task transmission reliability based on the Finite Block Length (FBL) theory while following the delay constraint. To achieve this goal, we formulate the problem of task replication and power allocation into a constrained stochastic optimization problem and apply the Lyapunov optimization framework to adjust task replication decisions and power allocation for each vehicle. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can obtain better service reliability than other alternative algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Efficient Communication Networks via Multiple Aerial Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: DRL and Optimization Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10301685</link><description>In the realm of wireless communications in 5G, 6G and beyond, deploying unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been an innovative approach to extend the coverage area due to its easy deployment. Moreover, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has also emerged as a new paradigm with the goals of enhancing the average sum-rate as well as energy efficiency. By combining these attractive features, an energy-efficient RIS-mounted multiple UAVs (aerial RISs: ARISs) assisted downlink communication system is studied. Due to the obstruction, user equipments (UEs) can have a poor line of sight to communicate with the base station (BS). To solve this, multiple ARISs are implemented to assist the communication between the BS and UEs. Then, the joint optimization problem of deployment of ARIS, ARIS reflecting elements on/off states, phase shift, and power control of the multiple ARISs-assisted communication system is formulated. The problem is challenging to solve since it is mixed-integer, non-convex, and NP-hard. To overcome this, it is decomposed into three sub-problems. Afterward, successive convex approximation (SCA), actor-critic proximal policy optimization (AC-PPO), and whale optimization algorithm (WOA) are employed to solve these sub-problems alternatingly. Finally, extensive simulation results have been generated to illustrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Coverage and Throughput Analysis for Peer-to-Peer 6G Directional Slotted Aloha Bursty Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306312</link><description>This paper presents a theoretical framework for investigating the coverage and throughput behavior of sixth generation (6G) peer-to-peer (P2P) directional slotted Aloha (DirSA) networks managing bursty traffic flows. Proper channel models, accounting for interference, noise, path-loss, random node location, power fluctuation, and beam pointing error, are adopted to derive analytical expressions for the statistic of the received power in ground, air, and space propagation contexts. The resulting coverage probability, obtained in simple integral form for different omnidirectional/directional transmission/reception modes, is exploited to derive multidimensional Markov chains for estimating the throughput in the absence and in the presence of a feedback mechanism, considering also the impact of the initial access procedure and of the beam training overhead. The theoretical results, which are validated by exhaustive Monte Carlo simulations, are used to evaluate the influence of the code-modulation scheme, of the operating signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR), and of the burst length on the performance of 6G terrestrial, aerial, and satellite P2P DirSA subnets.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Resource Allocation With Federated Learning for Delay-Sensitive IoV Services</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302355</link><description>In this paper, we propose a distributed sidelink resource allocation approach named federated multi-agent deep Q network (FMDQN). The objective is the network spectrum-energy efficiency (SEE) maximization. To address the optimization problem in a distributed manner, we merge federated learning and deep reinforcement learning. We establish an asynchronous federated learning framework by facilitating local model training, thus avoiding the transmission of user-sensitive raw data. Our proposed approach utilizes a client-server architecture and federated aggregation. Additionally, we formulate a sub-band and power allocation strategy that aims to maximize SEE while adhering to strict delay limits for the given task. Simulation results illustrate the favorable convergence of the proposed algorithm in highly dynamic and uncertain Internet of vehicles (IoV) environments.</description></item><item><title>FedTO: Mobile-Aware Task Offloading in Multi-Base Station Collaborative MEC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304307</link><description>With the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT), mobile edge computing (MEC) has great potential to achieve low latency, high reliability, and low energy consumption. However, in collaborative MEC environments, user movement and task migration may cause task transmission and processing delays, resulting in elevated task response times. Therefore, system performance and user experience need to be ensured by rational task offloading and resource management. At the same time, the protection of user data privacy is becoming increasingly important as a challenge to be overcome. To address the problems of intense resource competition and privacy leakage in MEC, the federated learning for the TD3-based task offloading (FedTO) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm has a dual objective of energy consumption and task response time while protecting user privacy. It employs a cryptographic local model update and aggregation mechanism and uses deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to obtain an efficient task offloading decision. Based on the mobile trajectories of real devices, and the pre-deployment of base station locations, experimental results show that the FedTO algorithm ensures task data security. It also effectively reduces the total energy consumption and average task response time of the system, which further improves the system utility.</description></item><item><title>Timing Advance Estimation in Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286908</link><description>Low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication based on 3GPP standard is seen as a promising solution to rolling out communication services in areas without terrestrial base stations. However, due to the fast movement of satellites and large beam footprint size, the existing 5G timing advance (TA) estimation mechanism cannot be directly applied when global navigation satellite system is unavailable. In this article, an enhanced TA estimation approach is proposed for LEO satellite communication networks. Specifically, a user-side time-frequency pre-compensation method is introduced at first, which leverages frequency offset measurement on synchronization signal blocks broadcasted by satellites in initial cell search phase. For the random access phase, the upper bound of inter-preamble interference incurred by partial-period cross-correlation operations is derived for a preamble format advised by 3GPP, and it is shown that the interference level is closely related to the square of the number of such operations. Inspired by this result, a cyclic prefix free preamble format is further designed, which features extended guard time, differential power allocation and flexible preamble structure. Numerical results show that our proposal can reduce the missed detection rate of preamble within a beam. Particularly, the missed detection rates of preamble under 32, 48, and 64 users are lower than 1$\%$ when SNR = &#8722;6 dB, which is a significant improvement compared to baselines. In addition, our proposal can limit the TA estimation error of the detected users to the time length of 25 time-domain sampling points when the subcarrier spacing is 30 kHz and operation frequency is 27 GHz.</description></item><item><title>Dissatisfaction Feedback and Stackelberg Game-Based Task Offloading Mechanism for Parked Vehicle Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296002</link><description>Considering the limited computing power of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers and the emergence of Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs), we employ the computing paradigm known as Parked Vehicle Edge Computing (PVEC) to leverage the computational capabilities of idle vehicles, thereby enhancing the overall computing performance of these vehicles. We establish a multi-stage Stackelberg game model, which captures the interactions among the requester (RV), the service provider (SP), and the parked vehicles (PV). In order to incentivize parked vehicles to provide computing power, we design a dissatisfaction feedback mechanism. To optimize the system and maximize the relative benefits of all stakeholders, we formulate an optimization problem to find an optimal pricing scheme that guides task allocation and resource utilization. We employ reverse induction and gradient descent to solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the dissatisfaction feedback mechanism and provide insights into the changing trends of optimal strategies at each stage as the task density increases. These findings contribute to the understanding of PVEC and offer guidance for real-world task offloading scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Transmit Power Minimization for STAR-RIS Aided FD-NOMA Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10272684</link><description>The source and destination should be located on the same side of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which limits its flexibility and coverage. In this correspondence, a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS) aided full-duplex non-orthogonal multiple access scheme is proposed to structure a full-space smart radio environment. By jointly optimizing the power allocation coefficients at the access point, the transmit beamforming at the cell-center user and the reflection and transmission beamformings at the STAR-RIS, the total transmit power is minimized. Owing to the non-convexity caused by the coupling of active and passive beamformings, we first decouple it into two sub-problems. Then, the semidefinite relaxation and successive convex approximation are utilized to resolve them, respectively. Finally, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to tackle them iteratively. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the transmit power while expanding the coverage.</description></item><item><title>Robust Frame-Based Beamforming Scheme to Enhance Secure Multigroup Multicast Transmission for Multibeam Satellite Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285354</link><description>In this article, we propose a robust frame-based beamforming (BF) scheme to enhance the physical layer security for multigroup multicast transmission in a multibeam satellite system. By assuming that only the imperfect channel state information of each user is known, we formulate a constrained optimization problem to maximize the minimal transmission-outage rate with fairness, subject to outage probability (OP) constraints of all satellite terminals (STs), the intercept probability (IP) constraint of an eavesdropper (Eve), and the per-feed power budget. To cope with this complicated optimization problem, we first propose to adopt the Bernstein Inequalities, norm compatibility and $S$-procedure to convert the OP and IP constraints into deterministic forms. Then, we propose a robust frame-based secure multigroup multicast BF scheme to solve it efficiently. Finally, our simulation results demonstrate the superiority and robustness of the proposed robust BF scheme, and confirm that our proposed scheme can significantly improve the security and reliability for multibeam satellite systems.</description></item><item><title>Throughput Maximization for Covert UAV Relaying System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286397</link><description>Covert communication protects the communication behavior from being monitored or eavesdropped, which is particularly vital for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications since they are more likely to establish line-of-sight link. This correspondence investigates the joint trajectory and transmit power optimization for covert UAV relaying systems.

Simulation results verify that the proposed covert relaying method can improve the average throughput while satisfying the covertness constraint.</description></item><item><title>On Performance of Downlink THz-Based Rate-Splitting Multiple-Access (RSMA): Is it Always Better Than NOMA?</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288281</link><description>This article presents a unified framework analysis for downlink terahertz (THz)-based multiple-input single-output (MISO) rate-splitting multiple-access (RSMA) systems under spherical stochastic models. To simultaneously achieve the users' full diversity gain, a novel precoding weight design is proposed based on zero-forcing and maximum-ratio transmission approaches. Accordingly, closed-form expressions for the users' outage probability (OP) and throughput are derived in exact, approximate, and asymptotic manners. Additionally, the users' OP minimization problems are formulated and proven to be strictly convex with regard to the common power allocation (PA) factor. To clarify whether RSMA is superior to non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in future THz communication networks, the OP and throughput comparisons have been carried out. Numerical results confirm that: 1) our theoretical analyses exactly match the simulation results; 2) as for OP aspects, RSMA is not fully superior to NOMA in two-user cases, while for multi-users, it only outperforms NOMA in cases where imperfect successive interference cancellation process produces over 10% residual interference; and 3) as for throughput aspects, RSMA achieves the performance superiority over both two- and multi-users scenarios when compared to its counterparts.</description></item><item><title>Covert Transmission via Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292914</link><description>Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) Systems, which can support simultaneous information transmission and target detection, have been regarded as promising solutions for various emerging wireless network applications. In this work, a covert transmission system with the aid of the ISAC technique is proposed, where the radar intends to sense a target and send message to legitimate users covertly against the warden's surveillance with either perfect or imperfect channel state information (CSI) at the warden. We formulate a beamforming optimization problem for the dual-function signal used for sensing and communication to maximize the covert throughput, subject to a covertness constraint, a maximum transmit power constraint, and a radar detection constraint. We then determine the sufficient conditions under which the covert beamforming design problem can be solved by semidefinite relaxation (SDR).

Specifically, we consider the joint optimization of the power control and transmission rates to improve the max-min effective throughput and simultaneously provide the quality-of-service (QoS) guarantee of transmission reliability for each user. Though the formulated problem appears as a difficult non-convex problem, we obtain the globally optimal solution by first determining the optimal transmission rates for given powers and then obtaining the optimal power control through a line search. We further develop a simplified algorithm to obtain the nearly optimal performance. The superiority of our proposed algorithms is demonstrated via simulation results.</description></item><item><title>$\alpha$-Fair Resource Allocation for Downlink Multiuser Short Packet Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10297574</link><description>Short packet communications are promising techniques to satisfy the stringent latency requirements of delay sensitive applications. Existing works on short packet communications considered either sum throughput maximization or max-min throughput maximization, which correspond to zero fairness and absolute fairness among devices, respectively.

An RIS is leveraged to assist legitimate wireless communication. Dedicated sensing signal is transmitted with communication signal to enhance the sensing performance while preventing information leakage. The radar output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can be improved by jointly optimizing the transmit and reflection beamforming, and radar receive filter, while satisfying the communication performance requirement of each user, the secure transmission constraint, the power budget constraint, as well as the RIS reflecting coefficients restrict. An alternating optimization method is applied to decompose the non-convex multivariate coupling problem into three sub-problems. We then utilize semi-definite relaxation (SDR), fractional programming (FP), and majorization-minimization (MM) algorithms to solve the sub-problems iteratively.

By densely packing numerous radiation elements together, HMIMOS is capable of realizing accurate beamforming with low hardware complexity. However, enormous radiation elements on the HMIMOS lead to high computational complexity and signaling overhead when applying traditional beamforming schemes relying on instantaneous channel state information (CSI). To tackle this problem, we propose a two-timescale optimization scheme to minimize the required transmission power under the constraint of all users' quality-of-service (QoS). Specifically, the beampatterns at the base station (BS) and the user equippment (UE) are optimized over the slowly changing statistical CSI based on the constrained stochastic successive convex approximation (CSSCA) algorithm. Then, the instantaneous CSI is utilized to design the precoding matrix in order to ensure the system performance without significant increase in computational cost, due to the small number of feeds on the HMIMOS. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to other baselines.</description></item><item><title>Active RIS-Empowered Signal Cancellation Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302337</link><description>When reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is used to initiate attacks without actively generating sources of jamming signals, signal cancellation attacks (SCAs) are the main methods. However, a passive RIS (PRIS) requires a lot of reflecting elements in order to obtain considerable SCAs when attacked systems limit signal leakage to non-target receivers. This puts the PRIS at high risk of being tracked and monitored by enemies. To increase the flexibility of RIS deployment while maintaining a significant attack, this correspondence proposes active RIS (ARIS) to implement SCAs, which is exact opposite to the original intention of proposing ARIS to improve transmission quality. Specifically, with constraints on maximum reflecting amplitude and maximum amplification power, we derive a signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) minimization problem. In order to achieve a fast attack, an algorithm with low complexity is proposed to resolve the non-convex problem. Numerical results show that ARIS can perform a stronger SCA than PRIS under more stringent conditions.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Multi-Level Amplitude-Shift Keying for Non-Coherent SIMO Wireless System in Rician Fading Environment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302402</link><description>In this paper, we consider a receive diversity wireless communication system with the transmitter employing multi-level amplitude-shift keying (ASK) signaling scheme for data modulation over Rician fading channels and the receiver utilizing an optimal non-coherent maximum likelihood detector for data reception.

Furthermore, the union-bound on the SEP of the system is proposed to be minimized by deriving an optimal multi-level ASK constellation under the constraint of total available energy at the transmitter. Numerical results show the superior performance of the considered communication system with optimal ASK constellation set compared to the traditional equally-spaced ASK constellation. Furthermore, it is observed that higher values of the Rician factor of the system, the average SNR, and the number of receive diversity branches play a crucial role in the reliability of the wireless communication system.</description></item><item><title>Density-Based Clustering Resolution for Grant-Free Preamble Collision in Cell-Free mURLLC Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304369</link><description>As one of the 6G stream services, massive ultra-reliable low-latency communications (mURLLC) can support massive short-packet data communication with high reliability and low latency, while the guarantee of its extreme demand becomes a technical difficulty. Grant-free random access (GFRA) is considered a method to reduce latency, but its performance is limited by the preamble collision caused by orthogonal resource constraints in massive communication scenarios. Due to the signal spatial sparsity of cell-free massive MIMO systems, each user being served by neighbouring access points can reduce mutual interference between collided users. This paper proposes a density-based clustering GFRA collision resolution framework in cell-free mURLLC systems, and the clusters obtained by two-dimensional information of received signal energy and geographic location are used to blind detect users for reliable access. Simulation results show that the proposed collision resolution scheme has an improved probability of successful access compared to previous resolutions, and the system is highly portable and adaptable to sporadic random traffic.</description></item><item><title>Convergence Time Optimization for Decentralized Federated Learning With LEO Satellites via Number Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273640</link><description>Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) is a federated learning framework without any central controllers. With the development of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, LEO satellites can be used to train a machine learning model collaboratively through DFL. However, due to the energy limitations of the satellites, DFL with satellites has higher requirements on the latency. In this article, we investigate how to minimize the convergence time of DFL with satellites by designing the number of satellites in each orbit and the number of orbits. In addition to considering the total energy cost and the distance constraints in satellite communication, we also consider guaranteeing the DFL performance in the problem of minimizing the convergence time. However, obtaining closed-form solutions to this problem is difficult since the target is non-convex and the performance is hard to evaluate directly. To address these issues, we derive an upper bound on the convergence time and transform it into a quasi-convex function first. Then, we derive the convergence bound of DFL with respect to the number of satellites and orbits. Based on these two bounds, we reformulate the problem and obtain the closed-form expressions of the optimal number of satellites and orbits. Simulation results confirm the impact of these numbers on the convergence time and verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>The Impact of Hot Injection Reaction Temperature on the Properties of Cu2ZnSnS4 Nanocrystal Thin Films for PV Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10356634</link><description>Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) is a p-type absorber layer semiconductor, which is a promising candidate material for advanced solar cell devices. CZTS nanoparticle thin films were synthesized via the hot-injection spin-coating method. Nanoparticle inks were deposited on soda lime glass substrates. Different reaction temperatures during synthesis were investigated by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), focused ion beam microscopy (FIB-SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), Raman spectroscopy, and Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy to study the effects of the synthesis reaction temperature on CZTS thin films. The energy band-gap decreased with increasing reaction temperatures from 1.55 to 1.34 eV for the temperature range 225&#8201;&#176;C&#8211;300&#8201;&#176;C. These energy bandgaps show values close to the optimum for a CZTS solar cell device. XRD confirmed the kesterite structure, which is the preferred structure in CZTS for high efficiency PV device performance. In addition, a clear increasing trend of the scattering domain size with the reaction temperature is found to be in good agreement with the FIB-SEM images. Raman spectra showed no secondary phases. EDS of thin films demonstrated compositions consistent with start-up precursor ratios (Cu-poor Zn-rich composition).

We demonstrate that the incorporation of N-CQDs leads to a substantial improvement in the performance of DSSCs. Under standard one-sun illumination, the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) achieved with N-CQDs is 2% higher than that of the bare cell. Moreover, we introduce two new metrics, the diffused-light coefficient and the low-light intensity coefficient, to evaluate the performance of DSSCs under nonideal illumination conditions. The diffused-light coefficient is recorded at 1.55, which indicates a notable enhancement in diffused-light PCE with N-CQDs. In contrast, the low-light intensity coefficient shows a significant enhancement factor 2, which highlights the superior performance of N-CQD-based DSSCs under low-light conditions. Our findings demonstrate that N-CQDs play a dual role in DSSCs, by being added to both the commercial dye and the mesoporous TiO2 layer. These results provide valuable insights to develop and optimize DSSCs, especially for applications in indoor or low-light environments. The proposed metrics, the diffused light coefficient, and the low-light intensity coefficient, offer a meaningful assessment of the device's performance under nonideal illumination conditions.</description></item><item><title>Development of Solution-Processed Eco-Friendly Cs2SnI6 Double Perovskite Thin-Film Solar Cell</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10376173</link><description>This article reports a simple and efficient solution-processed method for designing stable Cs2SnI6 double perovskite thin film solar cells utilizing Cesium iodide and SnI4 in a 2:1 ratio. Better crystallinity in a Cs2SnI6 film is typically associated with higher optical absorbance, lower carrier concentration, more carrier mobility, and improved air and thermal stability. This compound contains Sn, which is in the 4+ oxidation state, which makes it significantly more robust against oxidation. The detailed synthetic difficulties in processing these compounds in solutions are the primary concern of this study. The solar cell parameters, structural, morphological, and, optical properties of prepared Cs2SnI6 thin film were investigated using Netport Oriel12A solar simulator, thin film grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GI-XRD), field emission scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive X-ray, and photoluminescence spectra (PL-Spectroscopy). Further, utilizing the synthesized Cs2SnI6 thin films as an absorber material, we have fabricated n-i-p configured FTO/TiO2/Cs2SnI6/MoS2/Ni/glass in the ambient condition. The current study will also suggest future research directions for increasing the device performance of air-stable Cs2SnI6 perovskite solar cells.</description></item><item><title>Demonstration of a Monolithically Integrated Hybrid Device for Simultaneous Power Generation and Data Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10430188</link><description>A three-terminal, monolithically integrated InP photovoltaic (PV) device with an InGaAs/InAlAs electroabsorption modulator for simultaneous power generation and data modulation has been designed and experimentally validated. A discrete modulator with a data rate approaching 1 Mbps with an on/off ratio of 1.20 was demonstrated. The InP power generating junction of the monolithic device attained an AM0 efficiency of 14.1% for a 0.25 cm2 area, with the efficiency loss primarily coming from the expected loss in the lateral conduction layer that was designed to minimize fractional power loss in the PV device and to minimize insertion loss at 1.55 $\mu$m. The monolithically integrated device demonstrated the potential for data modulation up to 0.5 Mbps at 1.55 $\mu$m. Simultaneous power generation and data modulation were observed in this monolithic device, and the device has application in areas such as low size, weight, power (SWaP) satellites, debris tagging, medical applications, and high altitude, long endurance unmanned aerial systems.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Additional PV Weight on the Energy Consumption of Electric Vehicles With Onboard PV</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10430388</link><description>Photovoltaics (PV) in onboard vehicle applications adds weight to an electric vehicle (EV), increasing the overall energy consumption. Although the added PV system weight is small compared with the vehicle weight, the power generated by PV is also very small compared with the power needed to propel an EV, making the effect of additional PV system weight on energy consumption a nontrivial topic to analyze. We present a method to study the impact of the vehicle onboard PV weight on the energy balance of EVs for different vehicle-added PV and vehicle-integrated PV configurations. The results are expressed through a newly introduced parameter called &#8220;onboard PV yield factor,&#8221; where positive values indicate a net energy gain and negative values indicate a net energy loss of the onboard PV system. Simulations are carried out to highlight the methodology for the driving phase of a medium and large passenger electric car with onboard PV for a selection of trips. Our method calculates the energy consumption attributable to the added PV system weight and PV energy yield for the selected trips. Our results for these sample simulations for the driving phase show a large range of yield factors, indicating the importance of systematically studying the impact of onboard vehicle PV weight.</description></item><item><title>Perovskite Solar Module Enabled IoT Asset Tracking for Wildlife Conservation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10430371</link><description>Perovskite technology has shown impressive improvement in the last decade. Here, the first global positioning system (GPS)-perovskite-powered application is showcased by integrating flexible perovskite modules (fPSMs) onto an animal tracking collar for powering the Internet of Things (IoT) device that monitors wildlife bison to preserve the species and its habitat. A prototype of a solar-powered collar was designed to be more optimal for monitoring ample wildlife than commercially available asset-tracking devices, so it can provide necessary data to successfully introduce bison to new habitats. The fPSM were fabricated on a plastic substrate and connected in series configuration to generate power of 400 mW. A robust packaging with polycarbonate sheets and mechanical rivets was realized to withstand harsh environmental conditions, validated by conducting scratch and bending tests. The electronics and software system were optimized for ultra-low power mode operation, consuming only 1.9 mWh, which is 200 times less than the energy generated by our modules. The packaged modules in the outdoor testing setup retained over 30% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) and power after 350 days (8400 h), giving still 60 times more power than necessary over &#8764;1 year of operational condition.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Embedded System for Real-Time Fault Diagnosis of Photovoltaic Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10432772</link><description>In this article, a novel embedded low-cost system for real-time fault diagnosis of photovoltaic (PV) modules is proposed. The idea aims to develop an embedded application to classify certain defects that can frequently occur on PV modules based on infrared (IR) images in different regions (desert and Mediterranean climates). The investigated faults are sand accumulation, dirt on PV modules, degradation, and junction box overheating. After several inspections, these are the most commonly observed defects on PV modules in both regions (south and north of Algeria). A tiny convolutional neural network (TinyCNN) was developed, optimized, and integrated into a low-cost and low-power microcontroller (Arduino Nano 33 BLE sense). In this regard, a database of IR thermography images was built and used. The developed TinyCNN-based model could be run locally, without the need to send the data to the cloud for analysis and processing. Another microcontroller [Arduino Nano 33 Internet of Things (IoT)] was used to remotely monitor the state of the PV modules. Thanks to IoT technology, the results have been visualized and posted online on a dedicated monitoring webpage. The proposed embedded solution could be integrated into an unmanned aerial vehicle for real-time applications. Furthermore, it assists operators in diagnosing their PV modules and making a maintenance schedule. The proposed technique outperforms the existing solutions in terms of cost, consuming power, simplicity, and execution time. Simulation and experimental results clearly report the feasibility of the proposed embedded system, which has an average cost of around 120 US dollars.</description></item><item><title>Planet-Scale Energy Yield Potential of Next-Generation Bifacial, Multiterminal, Perovskite-Silicon Tandem Solar Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10400063</link><description>To continue reducing the levelized cost of solar energy, the photovoltaics (PV) industry is developing higher efficiency perovskite-based tandem solar cells. Among the various options, the two-terminal (2T) tandem has traditionally garnered the most interest and is expected to enter the market soon. However, the bifacial 2T perovskite-silicon (PVK-Si) tandem cell, constrained by current-matching requirements, would offer diminished energy gains in large-scale solar farms, especially when subjected to suboptimal albedo conditions. The 3/4T tandems obviate current matching and are expected to outperform 2T-tandem cells. However, the actual location-specific yield potential and relative gain of bifacial 3/4T tandems has not been reported in the literature. In this work, we use a novel end-to-end, multiscale simulation framework to carry out the first planet-scale simulation of single-axis-tracking solar farms employing bifacial PVK-Si 3/4T tandem in various ground albedo conditions. The analysis shows that the 3/4T cells offer up to 5% and 23% mean increase in annual energy yield compared with 2T-tandem and single-junction heterojunction solar cells in Earth's average albedo (${R}_A$ = 30%). Importantly, unlike the 2T tandem, the 3/4T tandem maintains its performance advantage across a wide range of albedo conditions, enabling flexible subcell design. The findings should encourage further research efforts aimed at tackling the recognized challenges associated with 3/4T technologies, such as minimizing optical losses and scaling up cell-to-module processes, to fully realize the potential of PVK-Si tandem technology.</description></item><item><title>Soft-Error-Immune Quadruple-Node-Upset Tolerant Latch Based on Polarity Design and Source-Isolation Technologies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10372497</link><description>A soft-error-immune quadruple-node-upset tolerant latch (SEI-QNUTL) with a low delay and high performance is proposed using 65-nm CMOS technology. The proposed SEI-QNUTL design consists of three soft-error-immune static random access memory (SEI-SRAM) cells. Furthermore, each SEI-SRAM cell employs polarity design and source-isolation technology to reduce the number of sensitive nodes and enhance the reliability of the latch. Compared with state-of-the-art quadruple-node-upset (QNU) tolerant latches [including high-performance and low-cost single-event multiple-node-upsets resilient (HLMR), QNU tolerant latch (QNUTL), and Latch Design and Algorithm-based Verification Protected against Multiple-Node-Upsets (LDAVPM)], the proposed SEI-QNUTL design reduces (on average) the area, delay, and area-power-delay-product (APDP) by 47.0%, 25.0%, 46.5%, and 66.3%, respectively. Extensive variation analysis validates that the SEI-QNUTL design is less sensitive to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations regarding power consumption and delay. Furthermore, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations show that the proposed latch exhibits high reliability when performing data storage. Compared with the existing latches, the SEI-QNUTL design makes a good tradeoff among delay, power, and area, and it can thus be used in safety-critical applications.</description></item><item><title>ALT: Area-Efficient and Low-Latency FPGA Design for Torus Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10411958</link><description>The homomorphic encryption over the torus (TFHE) is a promising fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) scheme that allows arbitrary homomorphic computations with the programmable bootstrapping (PBS) algorithm. However, PBS suffers from prohibitive computation complexity and latency, which hinders the practical applications of TFHE. To address these challenges, we propose ALT, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) accelerator for PBS that exhibits high area efficiency and low latency. Our approach involves modifying the parameters of the PBS algorithm to strike a balance between the computation complexity and the decryption failure rate (DFR). In addition, we leverage the Chinese residue theorem (CRT) to exploit the inherent parallelism and construct the primes to eliminate the need of CRT process and facilitate fast modular arithmetic. The ALT design comprises several carefully designed computation units, including inverse CRT (ICRT), divide-and-round (DR) operation, and monomial number theoretic transform (MNTT). We employ algorithmic and architectural co-optimization techniques to optimize these units. Notably, ALT features a low-complexity MNTT module, enabling the utilization of the bootstrapping key unrolling (BKU) technique with reduced latency and minimal hardware resources. Furthermore, all submodules of ALT are parameterized and scalable, allowing the entire design to be configurable according to varying requirements across different application scenarios. Experimental results on FPGA demonstrate that ALT significantly outperforms a similar configurable work in terms of latency, throughput, and efficiency. In comparison with the fastest FPGA implementation, ALT can realize lower latency while reducing digital signal processor (DSP) reduction by over 50%, leading to enhanced area efficiency and energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Low-Power Bus Encoding by Ternary LWC and Quaternary Transition Signaling: From Initial Concept to Circuit Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10360434</link><description>This article shows one of the potential applications of multiple-valued logic (MVL) for low-power data transfer in a network-on-chip (NoC). Dynamic power accounts for a large portion of the total chip interconnect power. This article combines ternary limited-weight codes (TLWCs) with quaternary transition signaling (QTS) to present a low-power bus encoding method. By this way, voltage swing and switching activity factor, the two main reasons for dynamic power consumption, are targeted. Not only does the proposed method reduce power, but it also accelerates data transmission because it compacts every four bits of information in only three ternary digits. Full details of the required components, such as a modulator, a demodulator, a quaternary flip-flop, and a quaternary repeater, are given. All circuits are simulated by Synopsys HSPICE and 32-nm CMOS technology. Then, the HSPICE results are applied to the Access Noxim simulator for NoC-level simulations. The results demonstrate that in a 3-D network with  $12\times 12\times4$  nodes, the proposed MVL bus encoding decreases the total energy and the average global delay by at least 9.25% and 31.39%, respectively, compared to when binary minimal encoding is used. Finally, the proposed model reduces the effects of crosstalk noise because it eliminates rail-to-rail transitions.</description></item><item><title>Memory-Efficient Multiplier-Less 2-D DWT Design Using Combined Convolution and Lifting Schemes for Wireless Visual Sensors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10445279</link><description>In this article, the combined convolution&#8211;lifting scheme is explored to address the design issues of 2-D discrete wavelet transform (DWT) structures. We found that the combined convolution&#8211;lifting scheme of type-1 (convolution followed by lifting) is more suitable than convolution or lifting schemes to design 2-D DWT structures with less on-chip memory. Furthermore, the canonic signed digit (CSD)-based multiplier-less designs are presented for convolution-DWT and lifting-DWT using  $9/7$  biorthogonal filters, and they have identical resource requirements for 12-bit coefficients. The proposed multiplier-less designs of convolution-DWT and lifting-DWT are used to derive a 2-D DWT structure to take advantage of the combined convolution&#8211;lifting scheme. The comparison result shows that the proposed combined 2-D DWT structure involves  $24\times $  less area-delay-product (ADP) and  $17\times $  less energy per image (EPI) compared with the best of the existing fractional wavelet transform (FrWT)-based structure and provides reconstructed images of 14 dB higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Compared with the recently proposed approximate lifting (ALF) 2-D DWT structure, the proposed combined 2-D DWT structure involves  $4.5\times $  less ADP,  $2.2\times $  less EPI, less on-chip memory by  $4N$  words and provides reconstructed images of PSNR higher by 7 dB, where  $N$  is the image width or height. Therefore, the proposed combined 2-D DWT structure is a better alternative to the existing 2-D DWT structures for low-complexity and low-memory realization of 2-D DWT especially for the visual sensor node applications.</description></item><item><title>A 0.079-pJ/b/dB 32-Gb/s 2&#215; Half-Baud-Rate CDR Circuit With Frequency Detector</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315076</link><description>A 32-Gb/s  $2\times $  half-baud-rate (THBR) clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit is presented by using a phase detector (PD) and a frequency detector (FD).

The proposed receiver bridge chip consists of a 4-lane D-PHY receiver (RX), a 3-lane C-PHY RX, a digital logic including 8b/10b encoder, and a 3-lane 8.0 Gb/s transmitter (TX) including a clock generator. The MIPI D-PHY RX consists of four data lanes and one clock lane. Each data lane consists of a high-speed (HS) RX with an equalizer and a 1-to-8 de-serializer including a sync word detector. The MIPI C-PHY RX consists of three lanes. Each lane supporting a data rate of 2.8 Gsym/s/lane includes an HS RX, a clock recovery, a de-serializer, and a de-mapper. To serialize and output 8b/10b encoded signals for byte signals, a 1.6 GHz clock with five phases is generated from a clock generator using a charge pump phase-locked loop (CP-PLL) with an  $LC$  voltage-controlled oscillator (LCVCO). Each phase of the five-phase clock is controlled to have an even phase through a phase error calibration circuit. The proposed receiver bridge chip enables the evaluation of six camera modules with the MIPI C-PHY using only one FPGA chip. When using the MIPI D-PHY, ten camera modules can be evaluated.

It always leverages a feature learning network (FLN) before backbones to obtain uniform representation from the scattered points. Grid-based FLN (GFLN) that partitions point clouds into uniform grids becomes the main category in recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) works. However, it heavily suffers from significant memory and computation inefficiency associated with high point sparsity and critical data dependency. To address these troubles, we propose FLNA, a GFLN accelerator with algorithm-architecture co-optimization for large-scale point clouds. At the algorithm level, the dataflow-decoupling strategy is adopted to alleviate the processing bottlenecks from pipeline dependency, which also reduces 78.3% computation cost by exploiting the redundancy from inherent sparsity and special operators. Based on the algorithm co-optimization, an effective architecture is designed with efficient GFLN mapping and block-wise processing strategies. It manages to improve on-chip memory efficiency tremendously through diverse techniques, including linked-list-based block lookup table (LUT) and transposed feature organization. Extensively evaluated on representative benchmarks, FLNA achieves 69.9&#8211; $264.4\times $  speedup with more than 99% energy savings compared to multiple GPUs and CPU. It also demonstrates a substantial performance boost over the SOTA point cloud accelerators while providing superior support of large-scale point clouds.</description></item><item><title>An Ultralow-Power Real-Time Machine Learning Based fNIRS Motion Artifacts Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10417024</link><description>Due to iterative matrix multiplications or gradient computations, machine learning modules often require a large amount of processing power and memory. As a result, they are often not feasible for use in wearable devices, which have limited processing power and memory. In this study, we propose an ultralow-power and real-time machine learning-based motion artifact detection module for functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) systems. We achieved a high classification accuracy of 97.42%, low field-programmable gate array (FPGA) resource utilization of 38354 lookup tables and 6024 flip-flops, as well as low power consumption of 0.021 W in dynamic power. These results outperform conventional CPU support vector machine (SVM) methods and other state-of-the-art SVM implementations.

To achieve high energy efficiency, this work proposes layer-wise configurable timesteps (LCTs) and channel-regrouped sparse convolution (CRSC) to explore and exploit the redundancy of temporal and spatial dimensions. In the temporal dimension, principal component analysis (PCA) is utilized to analyze redundant information in each layer, and LCT is adopted to balance and eliminate variable redundancies between layers. In the spatial dimension, channels are regrouped by spike activation frequencies to ensure workload balance, and sparse convolution is implemented to further accelerate SNN&#8217;s computation flow. A layer-fuse method that embeds the parameter of batch normalization in leaky integrate-and-fire (BLIF) is also proposed to reduce data movement and processing time. An energy-efficient SNN accelerator integrating the above methods is designed. Compared with the baseline, the hardware equipped with the proposed LCT can achieve  $3.22\times $  acceleration by redundancy elimination. The CRSC and BLIF can also reduce the hardware computation and memory access by  $3.24\times $  during inference. Implemented in TSMC 28 nm technology, this accelerator can achieve an energy efficiency of 36.89 TOPS/W at 650 MHz.</description></item><item><title>A 12.93&#8211;16 Gb/s Reference-Less Baud-Rate CDR Circuit With One-Tap DFE and Semirotational Frequency Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10336769</link><description>A 12.93&#8211;16 Gb/s reference-less and baud-rate clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit with a one-tap speculative decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) is presented.

The 1-bit DSM and digital mixer encode the multi-bit baseband  $I/Q$  input signal into a 1-bit signal for on/off controlling the 1-bit PA to realize the TMM operation. Capacitor arrays are not required in the proposed PA, and redundant power dissipation on charging the capacitor array in conventional switched capacitor PAs (SCPAs) is avoided. Furthermore, a hybrid FIR filter comprising a two-tap digital FIR filter and a two-tap transformer (XFMR) combined semi-digital FIR filter suppresses the DSM quantization noise (QN) to avoid efficiency degradation. The XFMR combined semi-digital FIR filter is insensitive to mismatches, which maintains the high linearity of the 1-bit TMM PA. The proposed TMM PA is fabricated in 65-nm CMOS. Without digital pre-distortion (DPD), it achieves 26.4% power-added efficiency (PAE) with 40-MSymbol/s 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signal and 20.9% PAE with 20-MSymbol/s 256-QAM signal at 2.6 GHz.</description></item><item><title>Concurrent Body-Coupled Powering and Communication ICs With a Single Electrode</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433569</link><description>Body-coupled powering (BCP) and body-coupled communication (BCC) utilize the human body channel as the wireless transmission medium, which shows less path loss around the body area. However, integrating both BCP and BCC requires multiple electrodes or alternating the uplink and downlink in the time domain, due to signal interferences and backflow between different paths. To address this issue, we propose a base station (BS) IC and a sensor node (SN) IC with BCP and BCC concurrency. At the BS, the adaptive self-interference cancellation (SI-C) structure suppresses the output signals that are coupled at the data receiver, enabling the concurrent uplink data recovery and downlink power delivery. At the SN, the ground domain of the uplink data path is separated from that of the downlink power/data path to suppress leakage between the paths. For regulated power supply in different ground domains, the cross-ground-domain power converter is designed with 89.1% efficiency. The ICs are implemented in a 40-nm 1P8M standard CMOS process, and BCC + BCP concurrent operations are successfully validated.</description></item><item><title>A Highly Digital 143.2-dB DR Sub-1&#176; Phase Error Impedance Monitoring IC With Pulsewidth Modulation Frontend</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10384697</link><description>This article presents a highly digital impedance monitoring IC that achieves a wide dynamic range (DR) (&gt;140 dB), small area (~0.2  $\text {mm}^{{2}}$ ), and small phase error (&lt; 1&#176;).

The proposed AFE employs a discrete-time transformer based on series&#8211;parallel converters as an input stage. The switched-capacitor (SC) transformer can provide a passive low-noise voltage gain, attenuating the input-referred noise (IRN) of the following continuous-time chain. However, it also degrades the AFE input impedance. As a remedy, this article presents an input-resistance-boosting (IRB) loop that successfully increases the input resistance, sensing the output of a following continuous-time stage. At the same time, we also introduce an input-capacitance-canceling (ICC) loop to improve the input impedance at high frequencies. The proposed AFE achieves 389- $\mathbf {M\Omega }$  input impedance at 1 kHz, which represents a 39 $\times $  improvement compared to prior work. Moreover, it attains superior noise efficiency, with an IRN of  $\mathbf {1.36}~\mathbf {\mu V_{\text {rms}}}$ , while consuming 370 nW. This results in a noise efficiency factor (NEF) of 0.34 and a power efficiency factor (PEF) of 0.1, the lowest reported values to the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge.

Single-ended and fully differential versions of operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) are presented in several configurations, achieving 37-dB dc gain, 22.4-Hz gain-bandwidth product, and 25- $\mu \text{V}$  input-referred noise at 6.87 pW in 180-nm CMOS. For system-level demonstration, the proposed techniques are used in an optical wake-up receiver (WuRx) for light fidelity (LiFi) applications with 78-pW power.

Addressing the challenge of exponential die area growth associated with higher digital-to-analog converter (DAC) resolution dominating color depth, we propose a three-stage-cascading interpolation design solution. In the first stage, a two-output voltage selector selects adjacent voltages from the global resistor string. The proposed overlap-switch merging (OSM) technique reduces its size by two times compared to conventional two-output selectors. The second-stage interpolation employs a successive-approximation-register (SAR)-interpolating switched-capacitor (SI-SC) DAC, enhanced with bit-adaptive switch-size (BASS) modulation to minimize the switching errors. The proposed SI-SC DAC also features an intrinsic two-output design for further interpolation in the subsequent stage. In the last (third) stage, a super-class-AB operational transconductance amplifier (OTA)-based buffer amplifier performs accurate 1-bit true-dc interpolation with no overhead while driving the final output with a fast slew rate. The prototype chip was fabricated in a 180-nm 1.8/5-V CMOS process. The maximum differential nonlinearity (DNL) and integral nonlinearity (INL) were measured to be &#8722;0.37 and 1.17 LSB, respectively, in a 10-bit resolution. The maximum deviation of voltage outputs (DVOs) achieved was 15.5 mV. The proposed chip exhibits a source channel size of 2211  $\mu \text{m}^{2}$ , which is the smallest reported to date, along with a competitive slew rate of 44 V/ $\mu \text{s}$  measured at  $C_{\text {Load}}\,\,=$  100 pF.</description></item><item><title>Monolithic 230-VRMS-to-12-VDC AC&#8211;DC Converter at 9 mW/mm2 Enabled by a 31&#8211;325-VDC Input Range Capacitive Multi-Ratio DC&#8211;DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10365240</link><description>This article introduces a fully integrated 230-  $\mathrm { \text {V}_{\text {rms}}}$ -to-12-  $\mathrm { \text {V}_{\text {dc}}}$  AC&#8211;DC converter implemented in a 180-nm high-voltage CMOS SOI technology. The primary block is a switched-capacitor dc&#8211;dc converter (SCC), which is reconfigured by parallelizing stages using low-voltage configuration switches. These configuration switches are connected between internally generated dc nodes that do not swing at the SCC switching frequency, thereby avoiding the periodic charging of the corresponding drain capacitances. An efficient pre-charging technique enables this SCC into the ac&#8211;dc converter without breaking down its low-voltage components. In addition to the SCC, a linear regulator is incorporated into the ac&#8211;dc converter, resulting in a  $2\times $  smaller capacitance to buffer the zero crossing. The design also features compact drivers and an efficient resettable capacitive voltage divider for input sensing. The measured power density is 9  $\mathrm { \text {mW/mm}^{{2}}}$  at 55.1% efficiency, advancing the power density of fully integrated state-of-the-art ac&#8211;dc converters by  ${ &gt; }5000\times $ .</description></item><item><title>An Outphase-Interleaved Switched-Capacitor Hybrid Buck Converter With Relieved Capacitor Inrush Current and COUT-Free Operations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10384704</link><description>This article presents an efficient buck converter design using the proposed outphase-interleaved hybrid switched-capacitor (OISC) topology. The outphase-interleaved switched-capacitor (SC) cells significantly extend the  $C_{\mathrm {F}}$  charge-balancing phase without disturbing the inductor volt-second balance (VSB), while doubling the effective inductor switching frequency for reduced current ripple. As a result, it addresses the intrinsic issue of sharply increased flying capacitor ( $C_{\mathrm {F}}$ ) inrush current in existing SC dual-/multi-path (DP/MP) hybrid buck converters under extreme duty ratios, resolving the tradeoff between SC cell conduction loss and inductor dc current ( $I_{L,\mathrm {dc}}$ ) reduction capability. The proposed topology attains three key advantages: 1) relived  $C_{\mathrm {F}}$  hard-charging-induced inrush current; 2) reduced  $I_{L,\mathrm {dc}}$ ; and 3) power stage normal operation without relying on an output capacitor  $(C_{\mathrm {OUT}})$ , resulting in improved conversion efficiency and power density. To enhance the overall power density and mitigate gate-driving path ringing, we propose an area-efficient fully ON-chip gate-driving scheme with a shared charge pump (CP), ensuring proper operations with all-NMOS power switches. Fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process with 7.63 mm2 chip area, the converter achieves a peak conversion efficiency of 97.3% and an overall peak current density of 585 mA/mm3 at 90.1% efficiency. Supporting a load current ( $I_{\mathrm {LOAD}}$ ) from 0.05 to 3.1 A, it converts 1.8&#8211;3.3 V input to 0.8&#8211;1.8 V output. Measured output voltage ( $V_{\mathrm {OUT}}$ ) ripple is ~3.3% of  $V_{\mathrm {OUT}}$  dc under 3.1 A  $I_{\mathrm {LOAD}}$  with zero  $C_{\mathrm {OUT}}$ .</description></item><item><title>A Wireless Sensor-Brain Interface System for Tracking and Guiding Animal Behaviors Through Closed-Loop Neuromodulation in Water Mazes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415452</link><description>This article presents a wireless sensor-brain interface (SBI) system designed for closed-loop neuromodulation in freely behaving animals. The system enables a novel experiment in which swimming rats navigate a water maze guided exclusively by neural stimulation. The system consists of two wirelessly linked application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs): a bidirectional neural interface and an animal-tracking image sensor. The neural interface ASIC features a novel stimulator design with adaptive termination-based charge-balancing and an energy-efficient neural recording front end that rejects stimulation artifacts. The animal-tracking image sensor extracts the swimming features of rats and maps them into stimulation parameters with hardware acceleration. Low-power ultra-wideband transceivers with a custom protocol have been developed to ensure reliable wireless communication between devices with a short latency, which is critical to closed-loop neuromodulation. Wireless power transfer and near-field data communication have been developed to allow a part of the neural interface to be implanted beneath the skin, eliminating the need for through-skin connectors. Both ASICs were fabricated using 180-nm CMOS technology, fully characterized on the bench, and have been successfully used in animal experiments. Through rigorous testing, the system demonstrated consistent success in guiding multiple rats through the water maze using only stimulation. This work advances closed-loop neuromodulation technology and also serves as a promising platform for future neuroscientific investigations.</description></item><item><title>A Sub-mm3 Wireless Neural Stimulator IC for Visual Cortical Prosthesis With Optical Power Harvesting and 7.5-kb/s Data Telemetry</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416734</link><description>This article proposes StiMote, an untethered, free-floating and individually addressable stimulator mote designed for visual cortex stimulation, aimed at vision restoration. The system is optically powered by a custom photovoltaic (PV) layer. In addition, the photodiode (PD) layer captures the light modulation and forwards it to the optical receiver (ORX) including a tranimpedance amplifier.

The ISR-ACT&#8217;s transmitter (TX) sends non-return-to-zero (NRZ) data through a small series capacitor to inject low-swing pulses into the line. These pulses are amplified and latched by a two-stage receiver (RX), where the 1st-stage transimpedance amplifier (TIA) amplifies the pulse data and positive feedback around both stages captures the data and maintains the dc level on the line. Achieving low signal swing through a capacitor divider, the ACT driver consumes less than half the power compared to regular rail-to-rail CMOS drivers while providing dc voltage isolation between the driver and the RX. Fabricated in a 5-nm standard CMOS process, the ISR-ACT link, operating on a 0.75-V supply, shows 0.66 UI margin at 25.2 Gb/s/wire over a 1.2-mm on-chip channel and demonstrates an energy efficiency of 0.190 pJ/bit.</description></item><item><title>A 6.4-GS/s 1-GHz BW Continuous-Time Pipelined ADC With Time-Interleaved Sub-ADC-DAC Achieving 61.7-dB SNDR in 16-nm FinFET</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10352434</link><description>We introduce a continuous-time (CT) pipeline analog-to-digital converter (ADC) featuring a time-interleaved sub-ADC-digital-to-analog converter (DAC) path in its first stage. The proposed sub-ADC-DAC path enhances the ADC&#8217;s bandwidth by improving the signal cancellation at the summing node of the first stage. In addition, we have developed an inductorless delay line for the first stage, improving the amplitude and phase matching, thus minimizing the input signal leakage into the backend ADC. Furthermore, the theoretical jitter limitations in the CT pipeline architecture have been explored, and the proposed theory is compared against the measured results. The prototype ADC was fabricated in a 16-nm FinFET process. The ADC achieves a peak signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 61.7 dB at low frequencies and 60.8 dB at high frequencies across a 1-GHz bandwidth. The active area of the ADC is 0.77 mm2, and it consumes 240 mW.

However, at low frequencies ( $\leq $ 10 MHz), their performance is limited by the 1/ ${f}$  noise generated by the near-minimum size devices used in their wide-bandwidth input stages. This, in turn, limits their use in radio receivers intended to cover both the AM and FM bands. In this work, a multi-path multi-frequency chopping scheme is proposed to suppress 1/ ${f}$  noise, while preserving interferer robustness, thermal noise levels, and linearity. Implemented in a CT $\Delta \Sigma $  analog-to-digital converter (ADC) sampling at 6 GHz, it achieves a 22 $\times $  reduction in 1/ ${f}$  noise, as well as 122-dBFS SFDR and &#8722;98.3-dBc THD in a 120-MHz BW.</description></item><item><title>A 1.8&#8211;65 fJ/Conv.-Step 64-dB SNDR Continuous- Time Level Crossing ADC Exploiting Dynamic Self-Biasing Comparators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433522</link><description>This work presents a power-efficient level crossing (LC) ADC designed to digitize sparse signals.

A prototype chip is fabricated in a Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company&#8217;s (TSMC) 40-nm CMOS process and works with a Xilinx RFSoC evaluation kit to complete the calibration loop for the radio analog front end (AFE). The FD AFE chip integrates an electrical-balanced duplexer (EBD) with a tuned impedance matching network ( ${Z}$ Bal), two broadband five complex-tap continuous-time finite impulse response (FIR)-based RF cancellation filters, and a mixed-signal baseband cancellation path operating with a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to complete a long-delay spread ( $\tau =+174$  ns) SI canceller. A fourth-order  ${Z}$ Bal is employed to reduce SI group delay and improves the cancellation bandwidth (BW) when used with complex filters. This work reports a measured SI suppression of 62 dB across +120-MHz BW for delay spreads between 0 and 0.28 ns and SI cancellation of 23 dB across +120-MHz BW for delay spreads between 0.4 and 174 ns.

The proposed ADC has a 1st order  $\Delta \Sigma $  ADC structure with a 1st-order loop filter and a quantizer. The loop filter consists of a passive lossy integrator, which is OTA-free, energy-efficient, and provides a 1st order noise shaping. The proposed VCO-FDSM as a quantizer also realizes additional 1st order noise shaping. Therefore, the overall structure has 2nd order noise shaping property.

The measurement results show that the ADC achieves a 49.8 dB SNDR and 60.0 dB SFDR after calibration at Nyquist frequency, while the total power consumption is 270 mW, leading to the figure of merits of Schreier (FoM $_{\mathrm {S}}$ ) and Walden (FoM $_{\mathrm {W}}$ ) of 152.5 dB and 106.9 fJ/conv.-step, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Inverse Modelling Techniques as Dynamic Digital Pre-Distortion for Broadband Systems for CS-DACs Based on Volterra Series Expansion</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433893</link><description>This paper presents a dynamic digital pre-distortion (DPD) method for a current-steering digital-to-analog converter (CS-DAC). The novel proposed method is based on the inverse modelling of the system with a Volterra series expansion. It uses a memory structure often only used for DPD in power amplifiers (PA). The goal is to find a model to counteract the signal dependent non-linearities of charge injection from the switching activity of the converter with a limited parameter count. A priori knowledge of the non-linear behavior and architecture of the DAC is exploited. The proposed Volterra system consists of a first and third order kernel with a respective memory depth of one. This results in a total number of only 6 parameters that need to be estimated. This is sufficient to significantly attenuate the non-linear distortions and efficient in terms of memory usage and computational complexity. The paper compares three different methods for generating the inverse of the Volterra system and determines the performance difference between them. The evaluation of the proposed DPD is done via Spice simulations of a 14-bit CS-DAC using a lumped circuit model and Spectre simulations of a real 14-bit 16 nm DAC design. Narrow-band and broad-band discrete multi-tone (DMT) signals with a frequency of up to 684 MHz are considered. The results show a performance gain of the missing-tone-power-ratio (MTPR) of up to 8.4 dB for both model-based and circuit-based simulations based analysis, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 20.3&#956;W 1.9G&#937; Input Impedance Capacitively-Coupled Chopper-Stabilized Amplifier for Bio-Potential Readout</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10404074</link><description>This paper presents a low-power chopper-stabilized capacitively-coupled frontend amplifier with auxiliary-path-based input impedance ( ${Z} _{\mathbf {in}}$ ) boosting. In order to achieve a high  ${Z} _{\mathbf {in}}$ , a low noise and a small chip area, techniques on both system level and circuit level are implemented. On the system level, small capacitors ( ${C} _{\mathbf {in}}$  = 0.5 pF,  ${C} _{\mathbf {fb}}$  = 25 fF) are used with a biased pseudo-resistor ( ${R}$  = 2.5  $\text{G}\Omega $ ) fed back to an amplifier internal node. As a result, a high achievable  ${Z} _{\mathbf {in}}$  and low high-pass corner frequency are achieved. On the circuit level, an input capacitance shielded current feedback (CSCF) topology achieving effective 10 fF  ${C} _{\mathbf {amp}}$  is proposed as the core of the capacitive feedback amplifier in order not to increase the input noise. Moreover, the design space of auxiliary-path-based boosting is explored to obtain the optimal value of buffer bandwidth and auxiliary capacitor size to save power. The amplifier and its  ${Z} _{\mathbf {in}}$  boosting circuit are implemented in a standard 55 nm CMOS process and characterized experimentally. Measurement results show that the proposed amplifier provides an input noise density of 50 nV/ $\surd $  Hz, and an integrated noise of  $0.85~\mu $  Vrms in 200 Hz band. The  ${Z} _{\mathbf {in}}$  is boosted to 1.92  $\text{G}\Omega $  at DC and 1.02  $\text{G}\Omega $  at 50 Hz with only  $1.0~\mu \text{A}$  in each auxiliary path buffer. The amplifier also archives 77 dB CMRR and 76 dB PSRR while consuming  $20.3~\mu \text{W}$  in total.</description></item><item><title>A 1.8&#8211;5.4-GHz GaN MMIC Distributed Efficient Power Amplifier With Reactance Compensation and Adaptive Biasing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10416812</link><description>This article presents an ultra-broadband distributed efficient power amplifier (DEPA) with reactance compensation and adaptive biasing. It is illustrated that the bandwidth of the DEPA can be improved apparently by applying a shunt short-circuited stub at the combining point. The principle of such method is that the back-off impedance variation with frequency can be compensated by the reactance of the shunt stub. Besides, to get over the high gain compression of the conventional DEPA, an adaptive biasing scheme is proposed for the auxiliary PAs. A DEPA is implemented in a 0.25- $\mu \text{m}$  GaN-HEMT process for validation. The shunt stub is realized by a LC tank equivalently for a compact size. The fabricated DEPA achieves a saturated output power of 41.5&#8211;43 dBm and an 8-dB back-off drain efficiency (DE) of 38%&#8211;46.8% from 1.8 to 5.4 GHz with a chip size of  $3.2\times3.2$  mm2. The fractional bandwidth (FBW) is up to 100%. Applying a 100-MHz LTE signal with an 8.5-dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), an average DE of 35%&#8211;43% is measured over the entire bandwidth, and adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) is better than &#8722;47 dBc after applying digital predistortion. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed DEPA demonstrates the largest FBW among all reported integrated back-off efficient PAs without using digital techniques or reconfiguration.</description></item><item><title>A W-Band 2 &#215; 2 Phased-Array Transmitter With Digital Gain-Compensation Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10420498</link><description>In this paper, a W-band $2\times 2$  phased-array transmitter with digital gain compensation is proposed to minimize amplitude and angle errors of synthesized beams. The RF phase-shifting architecture is utilized for the phased-array transmitter to reduce circuit blocks and lower system complexity. The high-resolution phase shifting is achieved by a vector-sum phase shifter, which is based on a quadrature-all-pass filter (QAF) with compensation network and Gilbert-type variable gain amplifiers (VGAs) with digital-controlled current digital-to-analog converters (I-DACs). To lower the gain error introduced by the phase shifter in RF phase-shifting architecture, the variable-gain power amplifier (VGPA) is proposed. The gain of the VGPA is finely adjusted to compensate the gain variation of phase shifter in different phase states. Meanwhile, the phase variation of the VGPA under variable gain states is optimized to avoid the influence on phase errors. To verify the aforementioned mechanism, a W-band  $2\times 2$  phased-array transmitter is implemented and fabricated in a conventional 40-nm CMOS technology. Based on the digital gain-compensation technique, the phased-array transmitter exhibits a less than 1.12dB RMS gain error and less than 1.82&#176; RMS phase error. In addition, the fabricated chip achieves 8.13dBm peak saturated output power and better than 9dB power gain with 135mW power consumption for each channel.</description></item><item><title>A 0.14-nJ/b 200-Mb/s 2.7&#8211;3.5-GHz Quasi-Balanced FSK Transceiver With PLL-Based Modulation and Sideband Energy Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10459220</link><description>This paper describes a balanced frequency shift keying (FSK) modulation, namely quasi-balanced FSK (QB-FSK), for energy-efficient high-data-rate communication. Not suffering from data-pattern dependency, the proposed modulation method enables frequency modulation (FM) over 100 Mb/s by utilizing a wideband phase-locked loop (PLL). The QB-FSK signal is generated with the same baseband clock frequency as the non-return zero (NRZ)-coded binary FSK (BFSK) signal, resulting in improved bandwidth efficiency compared to other balanced FSK signals. For demodulation, the receiver employs a sideband energy detection (SB-ED) method. A FM discriminator converts the QB-FSK signal to an on-off keying (OOK) signal. After that, a band-pass filter (BPF) is used to filter out 1/f noise and dc offset. Based on the proposed QB-FSK modulation and the SB-ED method, a prototype FSK transceiver is implemented in 65-nm CMOS for high-data-rate sub-6-GHz proprietary wireless connectivity. The receiver successfully demodulates data at a rate of 200 Mb/s with a sensitivity of &#8211;67 dBm, while the transmitter can achieve a maximum data rate of 400 Mb/s. The 200-Mb/s transceiver achieves an energy efficiency of 0.14 nJ/b.</description></item><item><title>A 1&#8211;8b Reconfigurable Digital SRAM Compute-in-Memory Macro for Processing Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10417860</link><description>This work presents a 1-8b reconfigurable digital SRAM compute-in-memory (CIM) macro, which significantly improves array utilization and energy efficiency under different input and weight configurations compared to previous works. To ensure the array utilization under different configurations, a row-based bitwise-summation-first digital CIM architecture is proposed. In addition, to realize flexible switching between signed and unsigned operations, a complete 2&#8217;s complement encoding method is adopted, which makes the computation of the sign bits consistent with that of the magnitude bits when performing signed operations, thus ensuring that each row of the CIM array can store the sign of the weight. Due to the support of reconfigurable bit width, the proposed CIM macro can be widely used in various neural networks for optimal efficiency. In order to better apply the CIM macro to binarized neural networks, a configurable bitwise multiplier is presented, which supports both AND and XNOR operations. Moreover, since the power consumption of the adder tree occupies a major part of the digital CIM macro, a 4&#8211;2 compressor based adder tree is presented to further improve the energy efficiency. Measurement results based on 55nm CMOS process show that the proposed CIM macro achieves an energy efficiency of up to 2238TOPS/W at 1b/1b and 44.82TOPS/W at 4b/4b MAC operations.</description></item><item><title>A Heterogeneous Platform for 3D NAND-Based In-Memory Hyperdimensional Computing Engine for Genome Sequencing Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10440648</link><description>Hyperdimensional (HD) computing is a promising paradigm for large-scale genome sequencing.

NVMs such as ReRAM have been widely used in CIM. Meanwhile, MRAM has higher read and write cycles, lower device and cycle variation and a lower bit error rate, making it equally attractive for storage. However, the high read current and low on/off ratio result in large energy consumption in MRAM read limiting its large-scale application in CIM. The spiking neural network (SNN) represents the information as sparse spike sequences and facilitates hardware to achieve low-power computing by taking advantage of its spatial-temporal sparsity. To further increase the input sparsity of SNN and reduce the read energy consumption, this paper proposes ADC-free, dual-spike (DS) -CIM macro, a spiking MRAM CIM macro driven by asynchronous dual spikes. Compared to the conventional rate coding, our dual-spike coding method uses only 2 spikes to encode the information without losing accuracy. Moreover, the event-driven feature allows the macro to have sub-nW static power consumption. Our DS-CIM macro achieves comparable or higher accuracy while maintaining very low energy consumption. Specifically, it achieves accuracies of 96.99%, 82.87%, 90.00%, and 85.97% for digit classification, image classification, gesture recognition, and action recognition tasks, with energy consumption of only 8.07nJ, 71.26nJ, 729.3nJ, and 369.82nJ, respectively. These results emphasize the significance of DS-CIM and provide ideas for low-power inference on edge devices.</description></item><item><title>Variation Aware Evaluation Approach and Design Methodology for SOT-MRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10437994</link><description>Spin-orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM), which exhibits sub-nanosecond write speed and high reliability, is a promising candidate for the future high-level cache. However, SOT-MRAM faces the problem of large bit-cell layout area due to its structural characteristics and write performance requirements, therefore it is necessary to explore the bit-cell design with optimal overall performance under the unified bit-cell area. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive variation aware evaluation approach for the area, latency, and energy of SOT-MRAM under the uniform yield standard. Based on this, the mainstream SOT-MRAM bit-cell designs with high-density method and multi-finger configuration are evaluated, meanwhile bit-cell designs with excellent write performance and their optimum area ranges are identified. Moreover, the source line read (SLR) mode with higher robustness against transistor variation is proposed to improve the read performance, and the dual SL (DSL) method is proposed to further reduce the read latency and write energy. With the DSL method, the read latency and write energy of 2-word-line (WL)-type bit-cells can be reduced by up to 36.5% and 12.6%, respectively. In addition, the DSL method can solve the shunt current issue of 1WL-type bit-cells and reduce the read latency and write energy by up to 43.6% and 17.4%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>DQ-STP: An Efficient Sparse On-Device Training Processor Based on Low-Rank Decomposition and Quantization for DNN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443594</link><description>Due to the bottleneck problems such as scenario-varying application, significant data communication overhead and privacy protection between off-line training and on-line inference, intelligent edge devices capable of adaptively fine-tuning the deep neural network (DNN) models for specific tasks have become the most urgent need. However, the computational cost is intolerable for ordinary on-device training (ODT), which inspires us to explore an efficient ODT processor, named DQ-STP. In this paper, we leverage a series of optimization techniques using software-hardware co-design. On the one hand, the proposed design incorporates SVD-based low-rank decomposition,  $2^{n}$  quantization and ACBN algorithm on the software side. This unifies the sparse computing mode of convolutional layers and enhancing weight sparsity. On the other hand, the proposed design effectively leverages data sparsity on the hardware side through four techniques: 1) The flag compressed sparse row is proposed to compress input feature maps and gradient maps. 2) A unified processing element (PE) array comprising shifters and adders is proposed to expedite forward and error propagation steps. 3) The PE arrays for error propagation and weight gradients generation are separated to enhance throughput. 4) A sparse alignment strategy is proposed to further enhance PE utilization. Through these software and hardware co-optimization, the proposed DQ-STP achieves an area efficiency and peak energy efficiency of 41.2 GOPS/mm2 and 90.63 TOPS/W. In comparison to state-of-the-art reference designs, the proposed DQ-STP demonstrates a  $2.19\times $  improvement in normalized area efficiency and a  $1.85\times $  enhancement in energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>HDSuper: High-Quality and High Computational Utilization Edge Super-Resolution Accelerator With Hardware-Algorithm Co-Design Techniques</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415279</link><description>Super-resolution (SR) techniques have been employed to construct high-definition images from low-quality images. Various neural networks have demonstrated excellent image-reconstruction quality in SR accelerators. However, deploying SR networks on edge devices is limited by resources and power consumption induced by significant algorithm parameters, computation complexity, and external memory accesses. This work explores the hardware algorithm co-design techniques to provide an end-to-end platform with a lightweight super-resolution network (LSR) and an efficient, high-quality SR accelerator HDSuper. For algorithm design, the improved depth-wise separable convolution and pixelshuffle layers are developed to reduce network size and computation complexity by considering the hardware constraints. Also, the improved channel attention (CA) blocks enhance the image reconstruction quality. For hardware accelerator design, we design a unified computing core (UCC) combined with an efficient flattening-and-allocation (F-A) mapping strategy to support various operators with high computational utilization. In addition, we design the patch computing scheme to reduce the external memory access of the hardware architecture. Based on the evaluation, the proposed algorithm achieves high-quality image reconstruction with  $37.44dB$  PSNR. Finally, the FPGA demonstration and ASIC layout under UMC 55nm are achieved with low power consumption ( $2.08 W$  and  $152 mW$ ) under the lowest hardware resources compared to the state-of-the-art works.</description></item><item><title>ESSR: An 8K@30FPS Super-Resolution Accelerator With Edge Selective Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10388489</link><description>Deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) is challenging to implement in resource-constrained edge devices for resolutions beyond full HD due to its high computational complexity and memory bandwidth requirements. This paper introduces an 8K@30FPS SR accelerator with edge-selective dynamic input processing. Dynamic processing chooses the appropriate subnets for different patches based on simple input edge criteria, achieving a 50% MAC reduction with only a 0.1dB PSNR decrease. The quality of reconstruction images is guaranteed and maximized its potential with resource adaptive model switching even under resource constraints. In conjunction with hardware-specific refinements, the model size is reduced by 84% to 51K, but with a decrease of less than 0.6dB PSNR. Additionally, to support dynamic processing with high utilization, this design incorporates a configurable group of layer mapping that synergizes with the structure-friendly fusion block, resulting in 77% hardware utilization and up to 79% reduction in feature SRAM access. The implementation, using the TSMC 28nm process, can achieve 8K@30FPS throughput at 800MHz with a gate count of 2749K, 0.2075W power consumption, and 4797Mpixels/J energy efficiency, exceeding previous work.</description></item><item><title>A 16.38TOPS and 4.55POPS/W SRAM Computing-in-Memory Macro for Signed Operands Computation and Batch Normalization Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10415281</link><description>Edge artificial intelligence applications impose rigorous demands on local hardware to improve throughput and energy efficiency. Computing-in-memory (CIM) architectures provide high parallel and energy-efficient solutions to accelerate the multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations in neural networks (NNs). While SRAM-based charge-domain CIM is achieving thousands of TOPS/W energy efficiency, it encounters limitations when dealing with full NN model deployments where both activations and weights are signed. This paper proposes an SRAM-based signed batch normalization (BN) CIM macro for supporting efficient bitwise sparse MAC computation with signed operands and BN operations in deep neural networks. The key features of this macro encompass: 1) a multibit weight unit for the optimization of bitstream sparsity and the sign bit computation, 2) a 2b-serial input configuration to increase throughput and the ADC energy amortization, and 3) a quantization-hardware co-design for the BN implementation. Measurement results show that the proposed 28 nm 64 Kb CIM macro achieves 16.38 TOPS throughput and 4.55 POPS/W energy efficiency, both normalized to 1b operands. The test accuracy of CIFAR10 is 92%, based on the ResNet18 model with co-design BN implementation at signed-8b precision activations and weights.</description></item><item><title>RDCIM: RISC-V Supported Full-Digital Computing-in-Memory Processor With High Energy Efficiency and Low Area Overhead</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10403109</link><description>Digital computing-in-memory (DCIM) that merges computing logic into memory has been proven to be an efficient architecture for accelerating multiply-and-accumulates (MACs). However, low energy efficiency and high area overhead pose a primary restriction for integrating DCIM in re-configurable processors required for multi-functional workloads. To alleviate this dilemma, a novel RISC-V supported full-digital computing-in-memory processor (RDCIM) is designed and fabricated with 55nm CMOS technology. In RDCIM, an adding-on-memory-boundary (AOMB) scheme is adopted to improve the energy efficiency of DCIM. Meanwhile, a multi-precision adaptive accumulator (MPAA) and a serial-parallel conversion supported SRAM buffer (SPBUF) are employed to reduce the area overhead caused by the peripheral circuits and the intermediate buffer for multi-precision support. The results show that the energy efficiency in our design is 16.6 TOPS/W (8-bit) and 66.3 TOPS/W (4-bit). Compared to related works, the proposed RDCIM macro shows a maximum energy efficiency improvement of  $1.22\times $  in a continuous computing scenario, an area saving of  $1.22\times $  in the accumulator, and an area saving of  $3.12\times $  in the input buffer. Moreover, in RDCIM, 5 fine-grained RISC-V extended instructions are designed to dynamically adjust the state of DCIM, reaching  $1.2\times $  computation efficiency.</description></item><item><title>NeuroSim V1.4: Extending Technology Support for Digital Compute-in-Memory Toward 1nm Node</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10443264</link><description>Over the past decade, numerous compute-in-memory (CIM) platforms have been proposed in the literature. While emerging non-volatile memory based analog CIM (ACIM) has been widely studied, its silicon demonstrations are in the mature legacy node (22 nm or above). As an alternative, digital CIM (DCIM) based on static random access memory (SRAM) is recently drawing significant attention, as it enjoys the scaling benefits with the logic process to the leading-edge node (5 nm or below), and does not suffer from the accuracy loss due to process/voltage/temperature (PVT) variations. To assess the potential of DCIM in the future, we release NeuroSim V1.4, a CIM benchmark framework, which supports advanced technology nodes down to 1 nm node. We project the technology parameters (standard cell, transistor and interconnect) using TCAD device simulations, interconnect modeling, and the available industry/IRDS roadmaps. State-of-the-art technology trends such as fin-depopulation, buried power rail, stacked nanosheet, etc are captured in the updated parameters. Technology scaling down to 1 nm enables DCIM to achieve 1.4 $\sim 1.8\times $  and 44.1 $\sim 63.1\times $  higher system-level figure of merit than state-of-the-art 7 nm SRAM-based ACIM and 22 nm RRAM-based ACIM, respectively, for representative workloads such as ResNet18 and ResNet34 inference.</description></item><item><title>A Memristor Emulation in 180-nm CMOS Process for Spiking Signal Generation and Chaos Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10387460</link><description>We present a new CMOS circuit and its successful fabrication of an operational transconductance amplifier (OTA)-CMOS inverter-based memristor emulator and investigate its switching behavior from 5 MHz to 50 MHz. It could be considered the first memristor emulator based on a current mode circuit and an inverter. Primarily, the transconductance of the inverter stage transforms the bias-voltage-dependent transconductance of the OTA into an overall flux-dependent memductance of the memristor. We also demonstrate how performance measures such as frequency response, noise, post-layout simulation, and process corners impact the memristive behavior of the design. The power consumption of the proposed memristor emulator is 2.25 mW. The aforementioned power figure is based on a 1.8 V power supply and calculated on a UMC 180-nm CMOS technology node. Further, using this memristor emulator, we implement a CMOS circuit for spiking signal generation called the Memristive Integrate-and-Fire (MIF) neuron circuit that mimics a biological neuron. As far as we know, a spiking signal generation using a memristor emulator remains unreported. Later on, we went on to realize a MIF neuron based object detection application to bring out the practical significance of the MIF neuron circuit. We have fabricated a chip of the proposed memristor emulator design with the die size of L= $1499.96~\mu \text{m}$ , W= $1499.96~\mu \text{m}$ , and included its fabrication result to validate the theoretical derivations in the work.

Applications such as machine learning have a certain resilience to noisy/erroneous transmitted data. Therefore, approximate communication becomes a promising solution to improving performance by reducing traffic loads under the constraint of the acceptable maximum accuracy loss of neural networks. It is a key issue to balance the result quality and the communication delay for approximate NoC systems. The traditional approximate NoC only considers the node-to-node approximation-based dynamic traffic regulation. However, the dynamically changing traffic patterns across different nodes, different times, and different applications lead to a huge search space, which makes it hard to explore an optimal global approximation solution. In this paper, we propose a quality model for different neural networks, which presents the relationship between the quality loss and the data approximate rate. Then, a hierarchical approximate scheme optimized with reinforcement learning (HAS-RL) is proposed and we reduce the complexity of the HAS-RL by reducing the state space and action space, which will reduce the resource overhead as well. After that, we embed a global approximate controller in the NoC system, in which we deploy a policy network trained with the offline reinforcement learning algorithm to adjust the data approximate rates of each node at run time. Compared with the state-of-the-art method, the proposed scheme reduces the average network delay by 13.5% while their accuracies are similar. The proposed HAS-RL only causes an additional area overhead of 1.24% and power consumption of 0.77% compared with the traditional router design.</description></item><item><title>An Output Voltage Tracking Control Method With Overcurrent Protection Property for Disturbed DC&#8211;DC Boost Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10445021</link><description>In this paper, the output voltage tracking control of DC-DC boost converters is studied. To meet the increasing safety requirements and enhance the control system robustness, overcurrent protection and disturbance rejection are investigated simultaneously. A simple and effective control scheme is proposed to achieve all these three goals, which includes two parts. In the first part, a disturbance observer is constructed to estimate multiple disturbances (including the input voltage fluctuations and the load variations). In the second part, a composite current-constrained controller is proposed by embedding the disturbance estimates and the nonlinear penalty term into the passivity-based control law. Under the novel control scheme, rapid tracking performance and safe overcurrent protection are obtained, even in the presence of multiple disturbances. Rigorous stability analysis is conducted to demonstrate the accomplishment of the output voltage tracking task and the strict guarantee of the current constraint. Simulations and experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>On the Damping of Ringing Affecting Power Transistors by Means of Active Gate Drivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418097</link><description>Fast power transistors require a tight control of their switching trajectory to exploit them at full speed, without degrading reliability and delivered electromagnetic emission figures of merit. By using active gate drivers in place of conventional ones, the switching trajectory can be shaped to reduce current and voltage overshoots, as well as the amplitude of oscillations. However, the tuning of such drivers is still an open issue. This paper investigates the damping of oscillations by means of active gate drivers, and proposes a method to tune them a-priori. The target switching waveforms are evaluated by means of non-linear damping elements in simulation, easing the tuning procedure. The proposed method was assessed on a digital active gate driver, providing the initial set-point for the adaptive controller. The convergence time measured experimentally was found to be as low as  $\mathrm {50~ \mu \text {s} }$  for the overall load current range, whilst not affecting the conversion efficiency of the dc-dc converter exploited as test case.</description></item><item><title>A Switched Capacitor Modified Fibonacci Cell Used for a DC&#8211;AC Circuit Supplied by Solar Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10403844</link><description>A Fibonacci-type switched-capacitor (SC) cell is modified in order to be suitable for an innovative, breakthrough switched-capacitor multilevel inverter (SCMLI) fitted for photovoltaics powered systems. Characteristic to such a cell, its capacitor voltages follow a Fibonacci series. Thus, with only a very few capacitors, a very large step-up of the input voltage is realized; and the staircase output waveform of a Modified Fibonacci - based inverter would feature a very large number of levels, being very close to a sinusoid. Such an inverter is necessary if its front-end is a green source of energy which provides only a relative low voltage. A common line-load ground two-output SC-based multilevel inverter is then developed, analyzed and designed. This inverter can feed two loads without interference with each other. The common ground (CG) effectively stops the leakage current of the solar cells. In order to get the same voltage step-up and the same number of levels as in a no-common ground inverter with the same structure, the Modified SC Fibonacci circuit is reinvented, by dividing it into two sub-networks, each one with another function. One of them together with the input source supply the positive half-sinusoids voltages of both outputs, thus assuring a permanent non-zero input current, as required by the front-end environmental-friendly sources of energy. The other SC sub-network supplies the negative half-sinusoids to both loads. The novel CG-SCMLI contains the smallest number of components per output among all the common ground SCMLIs able to provide the same number of levels in the output staircase waveform. The idea was implemented on a 400W 15-levels inverter providing two outputs of 220V rms, of a very small total harmonic distortion of 5.2%.</description></item><item><title>Setting Up the State Equations of Switched Circuits Using Homogeneous Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10391066</link><description>This paper discusses a new modeling framework for switched circuits.

We treat both cases in a uniform manner by describing Ohm&#8217;s law in terms of a single variable  $u$ , via the relations  $i=pu$ ,  $v=qu$ . The parameters  $p$  and  $q$  describe the state of the switch, either ideal or nonideal. An ideal switch is described by the values  $p= p_{\mathrm{ on}}=1$ ,  $q= q_{\mathrm{ on}}=0$  in the on-state and  $p= p_{\mathrm{ off}}=0$ ,  $q= q_{\mathrm{ off}}=1$  in the off-state, whereas nonideal switches are described by nonzero values of  $q_{\mathrm{ on}}$  and/or  $p_{\mathrm{ off}}$ . Regardless of the number of switches, all working states of a given circuit can be described by means of a single model which, in essence, may be set up by conventional methods. This avoids the need to draw different schematics and write down a variety of models depending on the state of each switch, as it is almost invariably done when modeling switched circuits. We use this framework to address the state-space formulation problem for switched circuits. The results are then applied to the analysis of several DC-DC power converters and a multilevel inverter.</description></item><item><title>A 521pW, 0.016%/V Line Sensitivity Self-Biased CMOS Voltage Reference With DIBL Effect Compensation Using Adaptive VGS Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10302323</link><description>This brief proposes an ultra-low-power self-biased CMOS voltage reference (SBCVR) with the drain-induced-barrier-lowering (DIBL) effect compensation to improve the line sensitivity (LS) and low-frequency power supply rejection ratio (PSRR). To reduce the dependence of bias current  $(I_{\mathrm{ B}})$  on the supply voltage  $(V_{\mathrm{ DD}})$  owing to the DIBL effect, the gate-source voltage  $(V_{\mathrm{ GS}})$  of biasing transistor is adaptively regulated by  $V_{\mathrm{ DD}}$ . In this way, the DIBL effect compensation is achieved, while the  $I_{\mathrm{ B}}$  is almost immune to  $V_{\mathrm{ DD}}$ . The presented SBCVR is fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  CMOS process, while 18 samples have been measured. The results show that its average LS reaches 0.016%/V and has been decreased by almost 85% compared to the one without the DIBL effect compensation. The design can also achieve a PSRR of &#8722;62.5dB at 10Hz. Meanwhile, the average reference voltage  $(V_{\mathrm{ REF}})$  is 317.6mV with a variation of 0.52%  $\sigma /\mu $ . The average temperature coefficient (TC) is 86.6 ppm/&#176;C without trimming from 0&#176;C to 100&#176;C, and the minimum power consumption at 27&#176;C is 521pW. The area of the reported SBCVR with the DIBL effect compensation is only 0.0016mm2.</description></item><item><title>A Fast Transient LDO Regulator Featuring High PSRR Over 100-kHz Frequency Range With Adaptive, Dynamic Biasing, and Current Mode Feed-Forward Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304368</link><description>This brief presents a fast transient LDO with high power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) over 100-kHz based on adaptive biasing, dynamic biasing technique and a current mode feed-forward amplifier (CMFFA). The dynamic biasing improves the load transient response and the adaptive biasing benefits the loop stability. The CMFFA introduces a left-half-plane zero to compensate for the non-dominant pole without large current consumption. Moreover, a impedance adaptive circuit is also used in this design: it ensures the DC gain and pushes a non-dominant pole to high frequency. Through these methods, the proposed LDO is stable over full load range, from 0mA to 150mA, it achieves fast transient response and high PSRR with a low quiescent current. The LDO is fabricated in a 0.6-  $\mu $  m CMOS technology. The output voltage can be regulated from 1.8V to 3.3V and the load capacitance is 1  $\mu $  F. For a 150mA load step and a 3.3V output voltage, the maximum undershoot voltage is 38.6mV. At maximum load condition, a 41dB PSRR is achieved at 100-kHz and the loop gain bandwidth product is 1.9MHz. The DC gain is around 70dB over the full load range. The measured load regulation and line regulation are 0.06mV/mA and 1mV/V, respectively. The LDO has a minimum quiescent current of 9.6  $\mu $  A without load. Finally, the proposed LDO achieves a FOM1 of 16.47ps and a FOM2 of 123.52  $\mu $  V.</description></item><item><title>Input-Independent Array Compensation in Memristor-Arrays-Based Neuromorphic Systems for Input Resistance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306331</link><description>Neuromorphic systems using memristors as artificial synapses have attracted widespread interest for low-power consumption and low-latency computing applications. However, networks based on the paradox of limited sources and progressively larger array sizes are affected by non-ideal effects, such as input resistance problems due to matrix switches. During vector array multiplication, the input resistance leads to great distortion of the out current and significant degradation of the network performance. Here, an input-independent array compensation (IAC) method for the input resistance effect is proposed, which only require a few known parameters (memristor column average conductance, array size, input resistance) independent of the input information to effectively solves current distortion problems. The simulation and experiment results demonstrate that the current distortion problem can be successfully mitigated and the accuracy of the network computing can be effectively restored by using the proposed IAC method. These results provide a feasible approach for the precise implementation of the neuromorphic system based on memristor arrays.</description></item><item><title>A 480 mVpp Linear Input Range, Low Noise Transconductance Cell for Multi-Input Sensor Interface</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306268</link><description>This brief proposes a high-linear transconductance cell based on parallel source degeneration and differential flipped voltage followers (FVFs) with balance resistors.

By reconfiguring the transfer function of the SOR with the clock signal, the proposed method achieves ELD compensation, resulting in improved power and area efficiency, as well as enhanced immunity to non-idealities. The proposed SDM is implemented using a single amplifier to realize a third-order resonator, and it employs a single feedback digital-to-analog converter using the proposed TDS ELD compensation method.

Higher order sinc decimation filters are constructed with tap coefficients that have a non-constant change in weight versus time. The magnitude of the chopped offset voltage being processed by the decimation filter does not vary with time. As a result, the chopped offset voltage can yield a time varying residual error that changes in magnitude as a function of the chopping clock phase relative to the start time of the decimation filter and data conversion. Simulation and hardware experiments have been created to help quantify the relationship between the residual offset error magnitude and chopping phase alignment. A 16-bit second order  $\Delta \Sigma $  ADC has been fabricated in a 130 nm technology that utilizes integrator amplifier chopping to reduce the converter offset voltage. The ADC includes a non-interleaved compact third order sinc filter suitable for low cost measurement applications that demonstrates the impact of partial offset cancellation. The results show how to optimize the residual offset error by adjusting the amplifier chopping speed relative to the conversion speed.</description></item><item><title>A Variation-Tolerant Voltage-Mode Transmitter With 3+1 Tap FFE in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10318210</link><description>In this brief, we introduce a voltage-mode transmitter (TX) equipped with a 3+1 tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE).

An analysis of transistor periphery selection is provided in order to fulfil linearity parameters concurrently targeting other design constraints such as switch isolation and size. It is shown that a trade-off between the contrasting goals of switch power handling (expressed in terms of 1dB compression point) and switch isolation should be addressed. The proposed linear versus nonlinear performance analysis is uncommon in the open literature since high power analysis is seldom treated in multi-bit phase and amplitude control circuits and even more valuable considering the relatively higher targeted operating bandwidth than previously published material. A useful insight into some design trade-offs required when synthesizing this class of circuits at Ku-band or above are here provided.

Its key highlight is the in-sensitivity to the input-referred offset of the error amplifier. This is advantageous compared to the prior work with high  $3\sigma $ -accuracy. In the prior work, the offset of error amplifier affects not only the PTAT current but also the CTAT current. This makes it necessary to greatly reduce the offset of error amplifier, leading to a huge area and power consumption. By contrast, this work proposes a new automatic current-controlled feedback loop, which greatly reduces the influence of the error amplifier offset on the BGR accuracy. As a result, the error amplifier no longer needs to consume large area or power in order to reduce its offset. This effectively reduces the area and power of the entire BGR circuit. For a fair comparison, both the prior work and this work are designed under the same  $0.13~\mu \text{m}$  CMOS process. Post-layout simulation results show that the power of the error amplifier is reduced by about 9 times when compared to the prior work. Furthermore, the total power of the proposed BGR circuit is also reduced by 2.5 times than the prior work.</description></item><item><title>CBRAM-Based Bio-Inspired Circuit for the Emulation and Treatment of the Parkinson&#8217;s Disease</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10342760</link><description>In recent years, the intrinsic neuromorphic properties of memristor devices have led to their extensive use in brain-inspired circuits and systems.

Due to the positive feedback path attributed to the complexity of the three-stacked power stage layout, typical capacitive neutralization techniques alone are insufficient to achieve high gain and stability at the same time. To solve this problem, we proposed an LC shunt-feedback technique that can alleviate performance degradation caused by parasitic inductance in the gate node of a power transistor. We designed a PA using a 65-nm RFCMOS process to verify the utility of the proposed structure. At 38 GHz, the proposed PA achieves output 1-dB compression point (OP1dB) of 18.8 dBm, saturation output power (PSAT) of 22.0 dBm, peak power-added efficiency (PAE) of 21.9%, and small signal gain of 32.2 dB, respectively.

The proposed FTA is composed of three functional parts, i.e., an independent amplitude-phase controlling metasurface (MS) on the top, a polarization-converter on the bottom, and a feeding antenna. Particularly, by using spatially designed amplitude on the aperture of the top MS with the specification of the Taylor distribution, much lower side-lobe levels (SLLs) could be effectively realized. The ray-tracing method is used to reduce the profile height and integrate both the feeding antenna and the polarization converter. The proposed FTA, which is fully integrated and fabricated using low-cost printed circuit board (PCB) technology, is verified by the theoretical analysis, full-wave simulation and experimental measurements of a prototype covering the entire 5G mm-wave n257 bands (26.5 to 29.5 GHz). The measured results show that the proposed FTA has a 3 dB gain bandwidth of 19% from 24.8 to 30 GHz and a peak gain of 21.08 dBi with an aperture efficiency of 18.3%. Especially, compared to traditional FTAs with phase modulations only, the proposed FTA performs an average SLLs reduction of more than 5.0 dB. The simulated and measured results coincide to confirm the feature and effectiveness of the FTA with the excellent performance.</description></item><item><title>A Modified Analog Predistorter Using Tunable Power Divider for Wideband 5G Transmitters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10352953</link><description>Advanced communication system such as 5G demands high data rate and wideband signals. These signals have a high peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR), which drives the power amplifier (PA) to early saturation. This brief proposes an analog predistortion method to linearize the power amplifier (PA) for wideband transmission systems like 5G. It utilizes a rat-race-coupler-based intermodulation generator to generate intermodulation terms, and it uses a Tunable-power divider (T-PD) based on varactor diode-controlled crossover structures to control the characteristics of the predistotered signal. This removes the dependencies on the bulky vector modulator which is frequently used in the conventional APD design. This also reduces the overall footprint. In order to validate the concept, the proposed APD with PA is tested with 64-QAM OFDM test signals of bandwidth 20 MHz and 100 MHz. It achieves a maximum improvement in the adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) and normalized mean square error (NMSE) of 23.67 dB and 18.21 dB, respectively, over that of PA. Though the components are designed at a center frequency of 3.5 GHz, the proposed method is tested in a frequency range of 3 to 3.8 GHz and provides a significant improvement in ACPR and NMSE across the entire frequency range.</description></item><item><title>Optimal IC Task Mapping to Maximize QoS on Heterogeneous Multicore Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304293</link><description>Heterogeneous multicore architectures have become one of the most widely used hardware platforms for embedded systems, where time, energy, and system QoS are the major concerns. The Imprecise Computation (IC) model splits a task into mandatory and optional parts, allowing the trade-off of the above issues. However, existing approaches, to maximize system QoS (Quality-of-Service) under time or energy constraints, use a linear function to model system QoS. Therefore, they become unsuitable for general applications, whose QoS is modeled by a concave function. To deal with this limitation, this brief addresses the Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) problem of mapping IC tasks to a set of heterogeneous cores by concurrently deciding which processor executes each task and the number of cycles of optional tasks (i.e., task allocation and scheduling), under real-time and energy supply constraints. Furthermore, as existing solution algorithms either demand high time complexity or only achieve feasible solutions, we propose a novel approach based on problem transformation and dual decomposition that finds an optimal solution while avoiding high computational complexity. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves 98% performance of the optimization solver Gurobi, but only with 19.8% of its computation time.</description></item><item><title>Finite-Time Self-Triggered Stabilization for Networked Power System With Deception Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10306282</link><description>This brief investigates the finite-time self-triggered stabilization for networked power system under deception attacks. Compared with event-triggered protocol, the extra hardware is not required to monitor the system state in the adopted self-triggered protocol, and only the latest samples and plants information are used to predict the next triggered instant, which effectively avoids the resource waste. Subsequently, a mathematical model is developed for finite-time self-triggered control with deception attacks. Taking the transient performance of power system into account, sufficient criteria to realize the underlying power system with prescribe  $H_{\infty }$  performance are obtained by means of finite time bounded theory. Furthermore, based on the linear matrix inequality framework, the expected solvability is constructed for finite-time controller.

Due to networked resource limitations and storage capacity restrictions, the exact information of their neighbors cannot be obtained by the agents. In this brief, it is supposed that the information exchanged between agents is quantized using a quantizer. By utilizing the open-loop estimation approach, an event-triggered control protocol is established, where the information communication with any connected neighbor is made discontinuously. To further reduce energy consumption, a dynamic event-triggered mechanism is designed, wherein a dynamic variable is assigned to each agent to dynamically govern its threshold. It is demonstrated that the presented control scheme can circumvent the Zeno behavior and the consensus control objective can be achieved. The validity of the theoretical analysis is manifested by the simulation results.</description></item><item><title>Deterministic Reinforcement Learning Consensus Control of Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems via Autonomous Convergence Perception</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10345763</link><description>This brief addresses an approximate optimal consensus control problem for multi-agent systems (MAS) using an autonomous perception empowered deterministic reinforcement learning scheme.

However, the low resistance of magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) results in significant power consumption in a conventional crossbar array, making it challenging to construct an efficient logic-in-memory. In this brief, we present a crossbar array of voltage-gated spin-orbit torque (SOT)-MRAM devices and establish a logic-in-memory scheme that implements majority gates in the crossbar arrays for reading operations. The multiple cells of the voltage-gated SOT-MRAM devices are connected in series, and each branch&#8217;s resistance is determined by adding the resistances of all the selected cells on it. In comparison to parallel connection schemes, the effective resistance  $({R_{eff}})$  in series connections are 25 times greater, resulting in lower read currents and improved energy efficiency. A case study of a 1-bit full adder serves as proof of the proposed logic-in-memory based on majority gates. These results indicate that the resistance summation in the voltage-gated SOT-MRAM crossbar arrays with majority gates is a preferred platform for logic-in-memory.</description></item><item><title>A New Design of Low Hardware Cost and Low Power Programmable FIR Filters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10320430</link><description>Programmable Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters (Proakis et al., 2007) are widely used in various fields such as communication, radio, audio, and signal processing. The Reconfigurable Multiple Constant Multiplication (RMCM) modules are commonly employed to design programmable FIR filters. In this brief, we propose a novel RMCM optimization algorithm to optimize the hardware cost and power consumption of the RMCM module which means lower chip area and lower operating power consumption. In order to reduce the overall search space, a segmented analysis method that divided the global search space into several sub-search spaces is first proposed. In addition, we introduce a novel necessity-first search algorithm for each sub-search space, which can optimize the structures of the multiplexers and shifters in the RMCM module simultaneously. The benchmark filters examples show that the proposed method can reduce the hardware cost and power consumption by at least 13.04% and 2.74% compared with the existing state-of-art methods.</description></item><item><title>A Weight Mapping Strategy for More Fully Exploiting Data in CIM-Based CNN Accelerator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10328651</link><description>Compute-in-memory accelerators have been extensively researched to overcome the limitations of the von Neumann architecture.

Researchers have utilized different SRAM cells to implement the in-memory logic operations. However, most of the previous works implement the column-wise logic/CAM operations, which require the column-wise stored operands. These column-wise logic/CAM operations are incompatible with the traditional row-wise SRAM mode. This brief proposes an SRAM cell with 11 transistors, which can work in four operation modes: the SRAM mode, the logic mode, and the BCAM/TCAM modes. All the operations in these four modes can be performed both in the column-wise and the row-wise style. The incompatibility between different modes is eliminated. In the logic mode, the proposed SRAM achieves frequency of 595MHz and energy consumption of 17.94fJ/bit at 1.2V with TSMC 65nm technology file.

The reliability of PUF is paramount, and therefore is one of the significant challenges for PUF design. This brief proposes a novel SRAM- and Inverter-based PUF (SI PUF) that can operate as either an SRAM PUF or an inverter PUF, depending on the input configuration signal. A zero-overhead bit configuration strategy (BCS) is proposed to enhance the reliability of PUF. Moreover, the working voltage of the sub-threshold level and the well-designed discharge stage ensure that our SI PUF can operate with low power consumption. The tested results of chips fabricated in 40-nm CMOS show that our SI PUF has only 0.0053% of the worst bit error rate (BER) under working conditions of &#8722;50 to 125&#176;C and 0.75 to 1.5V, with 0.073/0.042 pJ/bit of power consumption. The low BER and energy overhead illustrate that our SI PUF is more suitable for resource-limited devices compared to DAC 2022 and JSSC 2020.</description></item><item><title>Wide Dynamic-Range and High-Efficiency Shunt-Diode Rectifier Based on Class-R Harmonic Control and Resistance Compression Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315228</link><description>This brief presents a novel methodology for designing a high-efficiency and wide dynamic-range (DR) rectifier with shunt-diode configuration for wireless power transfer (WPT) and energy harvesting (EH).

In CHBIs, the cascading of H-bridge power cells generates the step inverter output voltage, so the individual or group of switches is responsible for the respective voltage level output. The OSF with a healthy anti-parallel diode is considered for the proposed switch fault detection and localization algorithm. The complexity of fault detection and localization is defined with respect to the fault signatures obtained from the individual switches at the output. The fault signatures of the diagonally opposite switches of the  $p^{th}$  H-bridge are approximately similar for ( $2{p}+$ 1)-level CHBI, where  ${p}$  is an odd positive integer. The non-ideal characteristics of semiconductor switches are used for the proposed fast and accurate OSF detection and associated switch fault localization logic design.</description></item><item><title>A General Voltage Optimization Method for Different Capacitive-Power-Transfer Coupler Pairs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10318177</link><description>Due to the small dielectric constant in air, the corresponding small coupled capacitances make a capacitive power transfer (CPT) system usually suffer high voltage stresses not only on the face-to-face coupler pairs but also on the lateral and crossing coupler pairs, thus increasing the risks of air breakdown and electric field (E-field) radiation. To solve it, this brief proposes a general method to optimize the aforementioned voltage stresses on the different coupler pairs simultaneously via a voltage vector triangle model. The detailed design principles involving the key parameters of compensation network are also given for four basic compensations. Besides of voltage optimization of coupler pairs, a CPT system is usually required to provide the load-independent constant current (CC) or constant voltage (CV) output under a specified power level. Therefore, the high-order compensation networks are used and analyzed to increase the design freedom of the basic four compensations and achieve controllable CC/CV output, while the voltage characteristics on the coupler pairs still remain. Finally, a 1 MHz LC-LCLC compensated CPT prototype is demonstrated and implemented with load-independent CV output, input zero-phase angle (ZPA), and voltage simultaneous optimization on all coupler pairs.</description></item><item><title>Common Ground Buck Type Five-Level Transformerless Inverter With Less Stress</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10324330</link><description>The presented brief introduces a new switched capacitor-based transformer-less inverter (SC TLI).

To this end, a novel model-free control method, ultra-local model-free predictive control (ULMFPC), is proposed as the secondary frequency controller to deal with the coordinated FDI attacks and system physical limitations. In contrast to the approaches available in the literature, the presented ULMFPC approach does not need the state estimation of observers and the mathematical model of the system. This method can independently cope with disruptions injected into the system. The ULMFPC considers the employed plant as a dependent system and utilizes predictive control in a constantly updated linear model to track the reference and control limitation. Unlike other predictive control methods, there is no training data set in the presented control strategy, and only small-scale convex optimization is essential for control computation. The proposed control method performance is evaluated by the Speedgoat real-time emulator and compared with the MPC and distributed economic MPC (DEMPC) methods under sensor and actuator FDI attacks. The experimental results indicate that the proposed ULMFPC technique provides much better dynamic responses compared to other methods.</description></item><item><title>Bifurcation Analysis and Criterion of Voltage Oscillation Induced by Low Voltage Ride Through Control in Renewable Energy Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10363634</link><description>The voltage stability issue of renewable energy stations (RES) cannot be ignored. In this brief, for the Voltage Oscillation Instability phenomenon caused by the Low voltage ride through during High active power output of the RES with No faults (VOI-LHN), works on both theory and criterion are conducted. In theory, it is explained that the VOI-LHN corresponds to a High active power output and Low voltage ride through control induced Non-smooth Bifurcation (HLINB). Furthermore, based on theoretical derivation and actual power grid parameters, the boundary between HLINB and Saddle Node Bifurcation (SNB) is obtained. The boundary suggests that in actual power grids, wind farms are more prone to HLINB than SNB. In criterion, a criterion for the occurrence of HLINB is developed, and a threshold calculation method for the criterion is proposed.</description></item><item><title>Robust Active Noise Control: Minimum Output Variance Approach With Least Mean Lp-Norm Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10330647</link><description>The filtered-x least mean  ${\mathcal {([A-Z]+)}}_{([a-z]+)}$ -norm (FxLMP) algorithm, renowned for its widespread usage, exhibits superior performance over the filtered-x Least Mean Square (FxLMS) algorithm in impulsive noise-afflicted environments.

Notably, this proposed algorithm exhibits improved convergence and stability even in impulsive noise environments, all while maintaining lower computational complexity. Extensive simulations validate the efficacy of the proposed MOV-FsLMP method, surpassing that of state-of-the-art alternatives.</description></item><item><title>Efficient 3-D Processor Array Reconfiguration Algorithms Based on Bucket Effect</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10333075</link><description>With the progressive augmentation of the density of 3-D processor arrays, some processor elements (PEs) often fail due to overload or overheating during massively parallel computing operations. Therefore, it is necessary to take effective fault-tolerant technology to ensure the reliability of the system. This article investigates an efficient reconfiguration method to construct 3-D fault-free logical subarray with more fault-free PEs and less interconnection length (interlength). First, we propose a novel method based on the barrel effect to find the bottleneck plane of 3-D processor arrays. Second, an efficient compensation strategy is proposed to replace faulty PEs on adjacent physical planes with fault-free PEs on the bottleneck planes, which leads to more fault-free PEs that can be used to construct the subarray. Then, we propose a heuristic to construct the subarray and optimize iteration redundancy to accelerate reconstruction. Finally, a heuristic optimization algorithm is proposed to reduce the interlength between PEs, which can reduce the dynamic power consumption and communication costs. In addition, we propose a more accurate method to calculate the lower bound of the interlength to better evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Simulation experiments show that, compared to the state-of-the-arts, on  $128\times 128\times 128$  host array, the utilization rate of fault-free PEs can be improved up to 15.6% and the interlength redundancy can be reduced by 78.2% for random faults. On  $64\times 64\times 64$  host array, the average improvement of the two indicators under clustered faults can reach 93.2% and 69.3%. Moreover, for all cases considered, the proposed new lower bound and reconstruction time can be reduced by an average of 18.47% and 76.13%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Silent Data Corruption in Robot Operating System: A Case for End-to-End System-Level Fault Analysis Using Autonomous UAVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10315202</link><description>Safety and resiliency are essential components of autonomous vehicles.

We use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a case study to demonstrate that system-level parameters, such as flight time and success rate, are necessary for accurately measuring system resilience. We demonstrate that downstream ROS tasks such as planning and control are more susceptible to SDCs than the visual perception stage in the perception&#8211;planning&#8211;control (PPC) compute pipeline. This observation only becomes apparent when we consider the complete end-to-end system-level pipeline, as opposed to isolated compute kernels, as previous work does. To enhance the safety and robustness of robot systems bound by size, weight, and power (SWaP), we offer two low-overhead anomaly-based SDC detection and recovery algorithms based on Gaussian statistical models and autoencoder neural networks. Our anomaly error protection techniques are validated in numerous simulated environments. We demonstrate that the autoencoder-based technique can recover up to all failure cases in our studied scenarios with a computational overhead of no more than 0.0062%. Finally, our open-source methodology can be utilized to comprehensively test the robustness of other ROS-based applications.

With powerful multiply and accumulate (MAC) engines for matrix multiplications, these accelerators show high computing performance. However, because of limited memory resources (i.e., bandwidth and capacity), they fail to achieve optimum system performance during large batch training and inference. In this work, we propose a memory system with high on-chip capacity and bandwidth to shift the gear of AI accelerators from memory-bound to achieving system-level peak performance. We develop the memory system with design technology co-optimization (DTCO)-enabled customized spin-orbit torque (SOT)-MRAM as large on-chip memory through system technology co-optimization (STCO) and detailed characterization of the DL workloads. Our workload-aware memory system achieves  $8\times $  energy and  $9\times $  latency improvement on computer vision (CV) benchmarks in training and  $8\times $  energy and  $4.5\times $  latency improvement on natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks in training while consuming only around 50% of SRAM area at iso-capacity.</description></item><item><title>INDM: Chiplet-Based Interconnect Network and Dataflow Mapping for DNN Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10318183</link><description>Chiplet-based deep neural network (DNN) accelerator is a promising solution to balance the performance and manufacturing cost. However, different from monolithic chips, interconnect network design and architectural partitioning for multiple chiplets would result in a huge design space and make it difficult to keep scalability and high hardware utilization. Moreover, how to efficiently map DNN workloads onto multiple DRAM dies and compute dies is another major challenge. To alleviate the above issues, in this work, we propose INDM, a chiplet-based interconnect network and dataflow mapping co-optimization for DNN accelerators. First, we propose an efficient hierarchical interconnect network composed of a multiring on-die network and a cluster-based interdie network, to facilitate the data reuse and traffic pattern in DNN workloads. Second, architectural partitioning and topology exploration for chiplet-based DNN accelerators are proposed to find the optimal architecture configurations. Third, an interdie communication-aware dataflow mapping is proposed to minimize traffic congestion during DNN layer switching. We implement the proposed chiplet-based interconnect network design and dataflow mapping algorithm for a set of popular DNN models, including VGG-16, ResNet-18, DarkNet-19, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101. Experimental results show that as compared with the state-of-the-art related work, such as NN-Baton and SIMBA, our work achieves 26.00%&#8211;73.81% energy-delay-product (EDP) reduction and 26.93%&#8211;79.78% latency reduction.</description></item><item><title>Counterexample Guided Neural Network Quantization Refinement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10324349</link><description>Deploying neural networks (NNs) in low-resource domains is challenging because of their high computing, memory, and power requirements. For this reason, NNs are often quantized before deployment, but such an approach degrades their accuracy. Thus, we propose the counterexample-guided neural network quantization refinement (CEG4N) framework, which combines search-based quantization and equivalence checking. The former minimizes computational requirements, while the latter guarantees that the behavior of an NN does not change after quantization. We evaluate CEG4N on a diverse set of benchmarks, including large and small NNs. Our technique successfully quantizes the networks in the chosen evaluation set, while producing models with up to 163% better accuracy than state-of-the-art techniques.</description></item><item><title>Error Resilience in Deep Neural Networks Using Neuron Gradient Statistics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10324308</link><description>Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are deployed across a wide range of applications, from medical robotics to autonomous driving, where safety and reliability are key concerns. The complexity, speed, and low-power operation of the underlying hardware makes them vulnerable to soft errors that corrupt the results of computations and memory accesses. Existing approaches to error resilience are either expensive in terms of overhead, require DNN retraining or applicable to only specific hardware domains. In contrast, we present a novel error resilience approach that does not require DNN retraining and scales across computation as well as weight parameter errors. In the proposed methodology, the statistics of gradients of neuron output values relative to adjacent neurons in an ordering of neurons allow tight theoretically grounded thresholding of neuron outputs to diagnose erroneous neuron outputs. These are then set to zero (suppressed) for error resilience. A low-overhead error diagnosis module is used for this purpose and is designed using gradient statistics collected across the training dataset of the DNN. Our approach is compared against state of the art error resilience techniques and validated on multiple datasets, networks and error scenarios as well a hardware test case.</description></item><item><title>DeltaGNN: Accelerating Graph Neural Networks on Dynamic Graphs With Delta Updating</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10324342</link><description>Graph neural network (GNN) accelerators have achieved prominent performance speedup on static graphs but fallen with inefficiency on dynamic graphs. The reason is that in dynamic graphs, updating on a few vertices will introduce enormous redundant neighbor reaggregation and feature reupdating. Moreover, evolving graph structure makes graph preprocessing impractical and incurs random memory accesses which can only be determined at runtime. In this article, we propose DeltaGNN, an algorithm and accelerator co-design for GNN acceleration on dynamic graphs. In algorithm, we first propose a delta updating algorithm, which identifies the sensitivity of vertices and reduces the aggregation and updating operations of insensitive vertices without accuracy compromise. In hardware, we propose a novel sensitivity remapping cache to satisfy the dissimilar reusability of vertices under different sensitivity without preprocessing requirement. To tackle the workload imbalance, we implement feature-disperse execution to support different feature updating between sensitive and insensitive vertices. Moreover, we introduce vertex feature coalescing to reduce the amount of feature vectors by exploiting the locality within vertex accesses. We then propose lightweight yet effective hardware optimizations to make our design applicable to conventional GNN accelerators. Compared to the state-of-the-art GNN accelerators, our DeltaGNN gains an average of  $1.5\times $ &#8211; $11.8\times $  speedup and  $1.3\times $ &#8211; $8.6\times $  energy efficiency improvement on dynamic graphs.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Processing of MLPerf Mobile Workloads Using Digital Compute-In-Memory Macros</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10318181</link><description>Compute-in-memory (CIM) has recently emerged as a promising design paradigm to accelerate deep neural network (DNN) processing. Continuously better energy and area efficiency at the macrolevel had been reported through many testchips over the last few years. However, in those macro design-oriented studies, accelerator-level considerations, such as memory accesses and processing of entire DNN workloads have not been investigated in-depth. In this article, we aim to fill this gap starting with the characteristics of our latest CIM macro fabricated with cutting-edge FinFET CMOS technology at 4-nm node. We then study, through an accelerator simulator developed in-house, three key items that would determine the efficiency of our CIM macro in the accelerator context while running MLPerf Mobile suite: 1) dataflow optimization; 2) optimal selection of CIM macro dimensions to further improve macro utilization; and 3) optimal combination of multiple CIM macros. Although there is typically a stark contrast between macro-level peak and accelerator-level average throughput and energy efficiency, the aforementioned optimizations are shown to improve the macro utilization by  $3.04\times $  and reduce the energy-delay product (EDP) to  $0.34\times $  compared to the original macro on MLPerf Mobile inference workloads. While we exploit a digital CIM macro in this study, the findings and proposed methods remain valid for other types of CIM (such as analog CIM and analog&#8211;digital&#8211;hybrid CIM) as well.</description></item><item><title>PROBE3.0: A Systematic Framework for Design-Technology Pathfinding With Improved Design Enablement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10322780</link><description>We propose a systematic framework to conduct design-technology pathfinding for power, performance, area, and cost (PPAC) in advanced nodes. Our goal is to provide a configurable, scalable generation of process design kit (PDK) and standard-cell library, spanning key scaling boosters (backside PDN and buried power rail), to explore PPAC across given technology and design parameters. We build on Cheng et al. (2022), which addressed only area and cost (AC), to include power and performance (PP) evaluations through automated generation of full design enablements. We also improve the use of artificial designs in the PPAC assessment of technology and design configurations. We generate more realistic artificial designs by applying a machine learning-based parameter tuning flow to Kim et al. (2022). We further employ clustering-based cell width-regularized placements at the core of routability assessment, enabling more realistic placement utilization and improved experimental efficiency. We evaluate PPAC across scaling boosters and artificial designs in a predictive technology node.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Constructions for Error Detection in WG-29 Stream Cipher Benchmarked on FPGA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10335912</link><description>WG-29 is a Welch-Gong (WG) stream cipher, implemented in  $GF (2^{29})$  and an 11-stage LFSR, whose polynomial-basis (PB)-based architecture is utilized in diverse applications. This work, for the first time, presents low-cost normal signature, interleaved signature, and Hamming code-based error detection mechanisms for the hardware implementations of PB-based WG-29 stream cipher. The presented schemes are benchmarked on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware platform using Kintex-7 and Spartan-7 FPGA families for area  $(&lt; 40\%)$ , power  $(&lt; 12\%)$ , and delay  $(&lt; 10\%)$  overheads. Using a faulty module to inject stuck-at single bit and multiple bit upsets, the error coverage for these presented schemes is evaluated via simulations performed in Xilinx Vivado for 80 000 faults and shown to be over 99.99%. The overhead and error simulation results for the presented schemes show that they provide high-error coverage with acceptable overheads to make hardware constructions of WG-29 more reliable. Other WG ciphers that have similar underlying primitives can also benefit from the presented work, with slight modifications, for secure hardware implementations.</description></item></channel></rss>
