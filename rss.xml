With this strategy, dc bias can be suppressed within half a switching cycle under different transient conditions, including ac-link voltage amplitude, switching frequency, and phase-shift angle variation. By rearranging the moment and quantity of SMs insertion or bypass, the volt&#8211;seconds balance of each arm voltage can be realized, thereby eliminating dc bias caused by amplitude step changes. Besides, dc bias caused by switching frequency and phase-shift angle step changes can be eliminated by adjusting phase-shift angle in the transient period. Experimental results are provided to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed dynamic control.</description></item><item><title>Transient Thermal Characterization and Assessment of Power Module With Encapsulated Phase Change Material Toward Overload Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106813</link><description>To mitigate transient thermal surge induced by the overload conditions in diverse applications, phase change materials (PCMs) have been proposed as an effective thermal management solution, offering enhanced heat capacity to maintain the power module within the safe operating area. However, PCM-integrated power modules face significant challenges, including excessive cost, process complexity, and increased steady-state thermal resistance. Besides, the absence of thermal models, insufficient understanding of thermal interactive mechanisms, and the lack of standardized evaluation criteria constrain the advanced thermal design for the packaging and practical application of PCM-based modules. To fill these gaps, this letter proposes a cost-effective and process-compatible overload-enhanced power module by the in-situ replacement of silicone gel with paraffin wax. Considering the impact of phase change transient on the junction temperature during the overload conditions, an improved thermal model is created by introducing the temperature-dependent heat capacity. Moreover, the thermal impedance of paraffin wax-coated power modules is comprehensively investigated by the finite element simulations. To quantify the overload capability, evaluation metrics comprising the optimal overload duration and the overall overload capability are proposed. Finally, power modules encapsulated with paraffin wax are fabricated, experimentally characterized, and evaluated. It is demonstrated that the proposed design provides an additional phase-change thermal impedance of 0.006 K/W with the steady-state thermal resistance maintained at 0.12 K/W compared to its silicone gel-encapsulated counterparts, thus offering a novel packaging approach and a thermal impedance-oriented evaluation criterion for power modules with high overload capability.</description></item><item><title>CNN-Based Robust Harmonic Feature Extraction for Open-Circuit Fault Detection and Localization in Modular Multilevel Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11104925</link><description>This letter presents a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methodology for robust and accurate open-circuit fault detection and submodule (SM) localization in modular multilevel converters. Instead of an end-to-end classifier, the proposed method employs the CNN as a physics-informed feature extractor to enhance a foundational theoretical model by robustly estimating switching frequency harmonic components from arm voltage measurements. Crucially, the CNN effectively mitigates the detrimental impacts of measurement noise and sampling frequency variations. This method offers low sensor requirements, adaptability to diverse operating conditions, and high computational efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate a 61.3% overall performance improvement, showcasing enhanced detection speed, SM localization accuracy, and robustness compared to the theoretical model under practical constraints.

Conventional methods fail to match the specific fast frequency response (FFR) requirements of the grid, leading to conservative assessment or inaccurate estimation-caused penalty. This letter proposes a peak operation mode (POM)-matching online FFRC estimation method for BESSs. An elastic resistor-based equivalent circuit model is developed to address modeling inaccuracy under strongly nonlinear impedance behavior during FFR-POM. Then, an impedance construction method is developed to obtain the continuous impedance curve, based on which online FFRC estimation is realized by iterative searching under multiconstraint. Experimental results prove the excellent estimation accuracy of the proposed method under various conditions.</description></item><item><title>A Monolithic GaN-Based LLC-SRC With Sub-1 mA Quiescent Current and 98.6% Peak Efficiency for Energy Star Standard and 80 Plus Titanium Standard</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11113492</link><description>The proposed GaN-based hybrid gate driver consists of two types of inverters and achieves a low quiescent current (IQ) of 23.2 &#956;A with a fast-operating frequency of 25 MHz. At the same time, the automatic precharge technique senses the voltage of the bootstrapped capacitor and reduces the standby mode leakage current (ILKG) from a few milliamps to 62 &#956;A. Therefore, the efficiency is greater than 92% at the entire output load. Finally, the soft startup clamping technique limits the peak voltage from 2.51 kV to 620 V, reducing power consumption during soft-start and preventing 650 V GaN devices from being damaged by high-voltage stress. As a result, the LLC converter achieves a peak efficiency of 98.6% and complies with the 80 Plus Titanium and Energy Star standards for power supply units.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Stability Analysis of Sustained Oscillations During the Miller Region for Medium-Voltage SiC MOSFET Power Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11103595</link><description>Sustained oscillations during the Miller region have been observed in a 10 kV SiC mosfet power module, which can reduce the robustness or even prevent the proper operation of the module.

By leveraging data-based representations, we establish data-based stability conditions for discrete-time systems. Then, we propose the data-based method for designing zero steady-state error tracking controller gains to achieve set-point tracking with guarantees of asymptotic stability, bypassing mathematical modeling of the controlled plant. Furthermore, considering the robustness against both the noise during data acquisitions and the disturbance affecting closed-loop operations, we develop a data-based $H_\infty$ tracking control design method, ensuring that the closed-loop system satisfies the $H_\infty$ performance. Finally, we apply the presented approaches to dc&#8211;dc converters control in dc microgrids. Voltage control of a single converter and power sharing of parallel-connected dc&#8211;dc converters are implemented by simulations and hardware experiments. The results show that the dc-bus voltage keeps stability under the input voltage disturbance and the load change.

The proposed system can charge both a high voltage main-battery and low voltage secondary-battery from the reconfiguration of the motor drive and the existed half-bridge converter as dual battery charger. Due to the anisotropic characteristic of the motor windings&#8217; inductance used as a grid harmonic current filter, an unbalanced current sharing can occur in stator windings during charging, which leads to torque production. In this article, a balanced current-sharing technique is proposed to cancel the charging torque and improve the performance of charging. The theoretical analysis of the charging current distribution within stator windings is conducted to determine the electromagnetic torques in both unbalanced and balanced current-sharing scenarios. The control algorithm, which is based on equal current sharing under different rotor positions, and winding-short-circuit-fault, is implemented. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Online Noninvasive Diagnosis Approach for Rolling Bearing Faults in Electric Drive System Based on Motor Radial Force Active Injection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11105478</link><description>Single-point fault and distributed fault of rolling bearings are two types of faults that need to be diagnosed in time. Conventional diagnostic methods based on fault impact or energy characteristics exhibit limited sensitivity in detecting slight bearing faults. To address this, this study focuses on the time-varying radial stiffness of the bearing system, which is highly sensitive to defects, to diagnose rolling bearing slight faults. In order to investigate time-varying characteristics of radial stiffness, the radial vibration model of bearing system is established. Differences in the time-varying characteristics of radial stiffness under different fault conditions are analyzed. Then, the time-varying stiffness spectrum measurement method and the diagnostic method based on kurtosis and characteristic frequency are proposed. Furthermore, the method for online acquisition of time-varying stiffness spectrum based on motor single frequency radial force active injection is proposed, forming a complete bearing slight fault online diagnosis scheme. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed theory and scheme are verified through experiments. Results show that the proposed method can diagnose and distinguish slight single-point fault and distributed fault that exhibit low sensitivity in conventional approaches, and is robust to system operating conditions.</description></item><item><title>Sensorless Active Disturbance Rejection Hybrid Control With Adaptive Sliding Mode Observer for BLDC Motor Drives</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106271</link><description>The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to perform complex maneuvers requires precise control of sensorless motors. However, chattering in UAV brushless direct current (BLDC) motor propeller systems, reaching steady-state in a short time, and physical sensors pose challenges. Field-oriented backstepping control (FOBSC) offers a superior dynamic response, and field-oriented input&#8211;output feedback linearizing control (FOIOFL) minimizes torque ripple and power consumption at steady-state. This article proposes a hybrid controller that combines FOBSC and FOIOFL control approaches with a novel rule-based switching algorithm to optimize dynamic and steady-state control performance, such as fast convergence, improved tracking accuracy, and reduced chatter, in the speed and torque of the BLDC motor drive. Besides, a model reference adaptive system disturbance observer is integrated with the proposed hybrid controller to enhance overall performance and actively reject disturbances. Furthermore, instead of using complicated physical sensors for UAV applications, an enhanced adaptive sliding mode observer is developed to estimate real-time rotor positions and speed and adapt variation in stator resistance, improving stability and performance. The stability of the proposed control strategy is validated using Lyapunov approach in all operational conditions. Various numerical and experimental test scenarios are conducted to find the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed sensorless active-disturbance rejection hybrid control approach compared to the individual FOBSC, FOIOFL control, and standard controllers.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Active-Bridge Based Self-Balancing DC&#8211;DC Converter With Coupled Inductor for Bipolar DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106286</link><description>Although bipolar dc microgrids exhibit enhanced reliability and transmission efficiency compared to unipolar dc microgrids, they are prone to voltage imbalance issues. This article proposes a dual active bridge (DAB) based bipolar dc&#8211;dc converter with coupled inductors to automatically balance bipolar output voltages under any load conditions. The proposed converter can operate with a simple single phase-shift modulation. Moreover, the coupled inductor is the key to realize self-balancing and roles as the power transfer inductor as well. The zero-voltage-switching can also be achieved for all switches under different load conditions. The operation and self-balancing principles are analyzed in detail. The characteristics of the proposed converter are well verified by a 1 kW prototypes under different load conditions.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Phase Shift Control for Asymmetric Two-Input Boost Converters to Minimize Output Capacitor Current</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106266</link><description>Interleaved boost converters (IBCs) are widely used in voltage step-up applications due to their high-power density and current ripple reduction. For some applications such as hybrid renewable energy systems, multistring photovoltaic (PV) systems, and solar-charged electric vehicles, the IBC may be connected to different inputs, such as different PV panels with different shading conditions, creating an asymmetric input IBC. For asymmetric IBCs, the standard phase shift angle of 360&#176; divided by the number of phases does not minimize output capacitor current and voltage ripple. While prior approaches have suggested complex optimization search algorithms to solve this problem, this article is the first to propose an analytical phase shift calculation method for a two-input asymmetrical IBC that lowers output capacitor root mean square (rms) current. The proposed method is simple and fast, with low computational requirements, and allows for real-time phase shift adjustments with minimal control system overhead. Extensive simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed analytical method effectively reduces rms current by up to 67.2%, validating its performance across a wide range of voltage and current operating conditions.</description></item><item><title>Planar Rogowski Coil Based Short-Circuit Detection and Partial Open-Circuit Recovery of the Resonant Capacitor in Series-Resonant DC Transformers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11097890</link><description>The 10 kW Series-Resonant DC Transformer (SR-DCX) enables both switch and resonant element count reduction and is a building block of a bidirectional two-stage dc&#8211;dc converter for 600&#8211;28 V MIL-PRF-GCS600 A and MIL-STD-704F compliant applications. The dc&#8211;dc converter is constructed with its first stage as a buck converter and the second stage as the SR-DCX. Failure mode assessment of the SR-DCX indicates a single-point failure on the resonant capacitor that will either prohibit or degrade the operation of the dc&#8211;dc converter, depending upon the failure mode. This article discusses the design of a planar Rogowski coil in accordance with MIL-PRF-31032 and its signal chain optimization for the measurement of ac current on the high-frequency link. We introduce a novel failure detection method to simultaneously identify both partial open-circuit (OC) and short-circuit failures in the resonant capacitor network by re-purposing the ac link current measurement, conventionally used for over-current protection. The method also enables recovery from partial OC failures to restore normal operation. The proposed scheme aids in raising system-level warnings for redundancy activation prior to catastrophic failures in the dc&#8211;dc converter for high-reliability applications.</description></item><item><title>Novel Quasi-Resonant Parameter Optimization Method of LCC&#8211;LCC Compensated IPT Systems With Wide Output Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11098859</link><description>In this article, a novel nonresonant LCC&#8211;LCC topology modeling and quasi-resonant parameter optimization method is proposed for inductive power transfer (IPT) systems. The new characteristics of nonresonant LCC&#8211;LCC topology are revealed and its modeling method using a variable resistor for battery load is presented. Wide-range power regulation is achieved directly through parameter configuration without additional circuit transformers, and the system maintains the zero-voltage switching (ZVS) condition with approximate constant current output characteristics. In addition, the lower limit for the detuning ratio coefficient and the widening of the detuning parameters selection are realized by magnetic integration design. Compared with existing traditional resonant parameter configuration methods, the proposed method aims to improve the overall performance of multiple working points within the quasi-resonant range, achieving a new effect of high ZVS robustness, wide parameter configuration range, and improved power transfer capability. The detailed design process of quasi-resonant parameters and integrated magnetic coupler are given. A 6.5-kW power level prototype is implemented to validate the proposed method. Experimental results show that within the designed quasi-resonant range, a 96.9% increase from 3.3 kW to 6.5 kW in output power is achieved under a constant proximity resonance state. The efficiency reaches 92.4% .</description></item><item><title>A Reconfigurable Multiresonant Switched-Capacitor Converter for 48 V Data Center Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106733</link><description>In the emerging two-stage architecture of 48 V data center power systems, the wide voltage range of backup batteries (36&#8211;60 V) leads to significant fluctuations in intermediate bus voltages when transmitted through fixed-gain intermediate bus converters (IBCs). To address this, a reconfigurable IBC based on multiresonant switched capacitors (SCs) is proposed in this article, achieving both 8:1 and 6:1 conversion ratios to suppress intermediate bus voltage fluctuations. The proposed topology combines a 2:1 SC with two 4:1 Fibonacci SCs, eliminating decoupling capacitors while reducing two switches. Two modulation modes with zero-current switching are described, and their corresponding component stresses are analyzed. Utilizing a two-phase output structure, the converter demonstrates low output impedance, which is estimated, decomposed, and discussed. Phase expansion can further reduce output impedance or enable dual-port outputs for dual intermediate buses. An experimental prototype with a 36&#8211;60 V input and 5.625&#8211;7.5 V output was implemented, achieving a nominal power density of 2266 W/in3 and a peak efficiency of 98.8% in 8:1 mode (3021 W/in3 and 99.1% in 6:1 mode). The reconfiguration capabilities of the proposed converter are also demonstrated.</description></item><item><title>A System Model for the Effect of Self-Balancing in Multiactive Bridge Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11121594</link><description>This article analyzes the effects of self-balancing in multiactive bridge converters. Therefore, it proposes a time-domain approach to model the dynamics of multiwinding transformer-based multilevel dc/dc converter, including self-balancing. In previous research, multiwinding transformers have been modeled using average-based power transfer models. These models, while simple, have no direct intuitive interpretation. Furthermore, they only include power transfer resulting from external phase shift between models, not taking the internal balancing of the shared magnetic core into account. In this article, a dc/dc converter model that includes the transformer as $M$-port network with magnetization and stray inductance and conduction losses is proposed. The model is verified using experiments showing both accurate predictions of both, circulating currents within each module and load currents affecting multiple modules. Furthermore, the effect of self-balancing is shown and how the model is capable to predict changes in the output voltage due to external loads. The model is also used to analyze the robustness of self-balancing to design parameter uncertainties.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing the Voltage-Support Capabilities of Grid-Feeding Inverters in an Islanded Microgrid Under a Short Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11098721</link><description>Nowadays, an islanded microgrid based exclusively on power electronic converters is a feasible scenario, in which one power converter is configured in grid-forming mode and the other converters in grid-feeding mode. In the event of a short circuit, the grid-forming inverter typically employs a virtual output resistor to limit the maximum current, which results in a voltage sag across the entire system. In this scenario, grid-feeding converters have the potential to follow conventional grid protocols during voltage sags. However, it remains unclear whether these protocols represent the best solution for voltage support in an islanded microgrid. This work proposes a methodology for analyzing the faulted system in the complex-valued domain, which produces a large signal linear model. Based on this analysis, a voltage support control scheme for the grid-feeding converters is then proposed. Finally, control parameters are derived to guarantee system stability. Selected experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Small-Signal Charge Model for Active Balancing of Flying Capacitor Multilevel Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106288</link><description>This article presents methods for modeling capacitor voltage dynamics in the Flying Capacitor Multilevel (FCML) converter and closed-loop control techniques for regulating the capacitor voltages to their nominal balanced values. A small-signal plant model is derived by studying the open-loop capacitor voltage dynamics using a linear-ripple model of the inductor current. Perturbations to the switching signals acting as control inputs are defined, and their impacts on the average currents flowing into the flying capacitors are identified. Unlike prior works based on averaging, the proposed plant models accurately capture the impact of the inductor current ripple on the average capacitor currents and yield valid models of capacitor voltage dynamics at light-load conditions. Using the proposed control inputs, the small-signal system is shown to be completely controllable, and a state-feedback controller is presented to damp the natural capacitor voltage oscillation. Plant models and controller structures are presented for all three operating modes of the four-level FCML converter. Experimental measurements of a hardware prototype verify the presented open- and closed-loop models. The capacitor voltage responses to supply voltage step-transients significantly improve with the proposed active balancing controller across the full load range.</description></item><item><title>Power Decoupling Control of Single-Phase Differential Cuk Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11098745</link><description>The single-phase differential Cuk inverter (DCI) is a single-stage inverter that offers numerous benefits over other single-stage topologies, making it a promising solution in new energy applications. However, the second-order ripple power inherent in its dc side seriously affects the performance of the system and restricts the application of the DCI. To address this issue, this study presents a novel automatic power decoupling (APD) control method for the DCI. It directly regulates the input current through a feedback linearization-based decoupling control strategy. An impedance-based stability analysis is performed on the DCI under the proposed APD control method. A hardware prototype is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed APD strategy effectively suppresses 97.8% of the second-order ripple in the input current and improves the system efficiency by approximately 2.8%.</description></item><item><title>Direct Charge Control for a Dual-Bridge Series Resonant Converter in the Half-Cycle Discontinuous Conduction Mode</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11105526</link><description>The half-cycle discontinuous conduction mode (HC-DCM) of a dual-bridge series resonant converter (DBSRC) has the advantages of small transient oscillations and zero-current-switching because the inductor current can return to and remain zero in every half-switching cycle. However, due to the inductor current&#8217;s segmented and nonlinear characteristics, the modeling and control of DBSRC in HC-DCM is challenging. To address the challenge, this article proposes a charge quantity model (CQM) for DBSRC. The proposed model represents a simple first-order linear model that uses the charge flowing through the resonant inductor as control variable. In addition, based on CQM, a direct charge control (DCC) method is developed, which simplifies the analysis and design process of a closed-loop system. During the control process, changes in the charge quantity inevitably cause an undesirable transient process. Therefore, to suppress the transient process, a transient process compensation (TPC) method is introduced, which can reduce overshoot and shorten the settling time, thereby improving the dynamic performance of closed-loop control. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulation and experiments. Compared with the existing studies, the CQM constructed in this article has lower complexity and the proposed DCC with TPC method can achieve better dynamic performance.</description></item><item><title>Efficiency-Oriented Multiobjective Modulation Optimization for the Dual Active Bridge Converter Using Fuzzy Logic-Aided Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11095846</link><description>As a key component in modern power systems, dual active bridge bidirectional dc&#8211;dc converters should maintain high efficiency across the full power range. Existing optimization strategies typically focus on single-objective approaches&#8212;such as minimizing peak current, RMS current, or backflow power&#8212;to improve efficiency. However, optimizing a single efficiency-related parameter does not necessarily maintain optimal efficiency across the entire power range. While minimizing power losses directly depends on an accurate power loss model, which requires recalibration whenever system components change. To address these limitations, this study formulates an efficiency-oriented multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) by incorporating multiple efficiency-related factors as objectives while considering soft-switching and mode boundaries as constraints. An offline two-step strategy is proposed to solve this MOP. First, the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm by decomposition is employed to generate a Pareto front surface. Second, a fuzzy inference system-aided approach is introduced to identify the optimal efficiency point on the Pareto front. The optimal phase shift parameters for different voltage gains and transmission power levels are then stored in a lookup table for real-time implementation. The proposed multiobjective optimization strategy is validated through both power loss analysis and experiments, demonstrating efficiency improvements across the entire power range. Compared to other methods, the maximum efficiency improvement is observed at 80% of the maximum power point, increasing from 90.9% to 93.1% when the input voltage is 200 V, and the output voltage is 180 V.</description></item><item><title>Low Profile Superparamagnetic Inductor for Portable Electronics Power Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11105508</link><description>This article primarily aims for a high-efficiency and high-power-density power management from the USB-C port to the battery within the next generation portable electronic devices. The hypothesis is that by employing superparamagnetic nanoparticles material, which has high permeability and negligible hysteresis loss, the high-frequency inductor design can be very efficient. Therefore, first, the new core material is characterized in terms of permeability and core loss. A dedicated circuit with mutual inductance compensation is used. The relative permeability at 1 MHz is found to be 12 and the Steinmetz parameters for core loss are $\alpha =1.19$, $\beta =1.99$, and $k_\text {SE}=2353$ for result in W/m$^{3}$ at 1&#8211;10 MHz. The permeability change with frequency is highlighted. Considering the fabrication constraint, two coupled inductor structures are analyzed. Due to the very low permeability level, 3-D finite element method (FEM) is used to obtain accurate inductance and coupling factor. The core loss, winding loss, and thermal models are incorporated into the inductor design. After optimization, a prototype is built and tested at 3.5 MHz featuring 84.9% nominal efficiency and 1049 W/in$^{3}$ power density. It can deliver up to 6 A at 4 V output for battery charging. The integrated inductor has a very low profile of only 1 mm height and 90 mm$^{2}$ area.</description></item><item><title>Reliable Detection of Armature Fault in Brushless Exciters With m-Phase Toroidal Winding Using Search-Coil Voltage and Field Current Signature Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11105510</link><description>In the operation of nuclear power plants, the fast, sensitive, and reliable diagnosis of rotating armature winding short circuit (AWSC) faults in m-phase toroidal brushless exciters (mPTBEs) is crucial. Traditional diagnosis approaches based on stator field current signature analysis (FCSA) are widely used on site due to their noninvasive nature. However, on-site operational experience has shown that this method may be influenced by fault transient processes and interference from the excitation current. To address these issues, this article proposes a novel AWSC fault diagnosis method that integrates a search coil (SC) and field current. By combining the ability of SC to capture spatial fractional magnetic field changes, the comprehensive fault characteristics can be obtained. To ensure immunity to field current interference, a blocking criterion is presented based on the ratio of fractional harmonics to integer harmonics in the SC electromotive force (EMF). Additionally, a criterion for abnormal operation based on the fault EMF features is also presented to assist FCSA in rapid diagnosis and sensitive warning. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through experiments on an 11-phase prototype, which demonstrates that the combination of FCSA and SC can effectively improve the diagnosis performance of AWSC faults.</description></item><item><title>Exploring the Inherent Fault-Tolerance of Model-Free Predictive Control in Three-Level T-Type Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106724</link><description>Fault-tolerant control (FTC) improves the reliability of three-level T-type converters under open-circuit faults in power devices. However, existing FTC methods rely on comprehensive and precise fault diagnosis, which significantly increases the complexity of diagnostic algorithms and limits their adaptability. To address this issue, this work proposes a highly adaptive FTC method based on model-free predictive control using an ultra-local model. The proposed approach dynamically estimates model disturbances caused by faults by employing a neural network observer. This eliminates the need for additional control variations due to different fault scenarios, and thus enables a unified control strategy. Furthermore, this method only requires the prior identification of vertical device faults without the need to diagnose horizontal devices or pinpoint specific faulty components, thereby reducing the complexity of fault diagnosis. Comparative experiments validate the proposed method&#8217;s adaptive fault-tolerant performance and robustness against filter parameter variations under various fault conditions.</description></item><item><title>Mutual Inductance and Output Voltage Estimation From Transmitter Side of Wireless Power Transfer by Utilizing Reflected Third-Order Harmonics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11106916</link><description>This article presents a real-time transmitter (Tx) side output voltage estimation method of a series-series compensated wireless power transfer (WPT) system by utilizing the reflected third-order harmonics generated by the receiver (Rx). The phase-shifted angle of the Tx inverter is set at 60&#176; to eliminate the third-order harmonic voltage generated by the Tx. A thorough theoretical analysis is carried out, and a closed-form equation is derived to show the relationship between mutual inductance, fundamental and third-order harmonics, and other circuit parameters. The output voltage is further derived. The mutual inductance and output voltage are calculated using a digital signal processor after the magnitudes of the fundamental and third-order harmonic voltages of the Tx tuning capacitor are measured. A practical prototype is built, and the experimental results show the estimation errors of less than 3.1% for mutual inductance and output voltage under the wide variations of the coupling coefficient from 0.2 to 0.6 and the load resistance from 10 to 80 &#937;, with an estimation delay of less than 1 ms.</description></item><item><title>An Interleaved Soft-Switching Bidirectional Converter for EV Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123779</link><description>This article presents an interleaved unbalanced capacitor voltage bidirectional soft-switching dc&#8211;dc converter to achieve a wide soft-switching range and high-power density for electric vehicles applications. In the proposed circuit, an auxiliary circuit comprising back-to-back switches and small auxiliary inductors are connected to the mid-node of switch leg to facilitate soft-switching. By properly designing the auxiliary loop, the converter achieves zero voltage switching and zero current switching conditions for the semiconductor switches across the entire load range. This technique effectively mitigates issues related to high dv/dt, diode reverse recovery, and switching losses in bidirectional dc&#8211;dc converters. Furthermore, an interphase transformer is integrated into the power loop, elevating the equivalent frequency of voltage/current ripples and minimizing power loop current ripples with a compact magnetic component, which improves power density. Finally, a 200 kHz, 5 kW prototype has been built and tested in the lab. The experimental power density (7.31 kW/kg or 18.21 kW/L) and efficiency (98.7% at full power load) achieved by the prototype confirm its viability in critical electric vehicle applications.</description></item><item><title>Model-Guided Modulation for Matrix-Type AC-DC DAB Converter Considering AC-Side Capacitor Voltage Ripple</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11107307</link><description>The matrix-type ac-dc dual-active-bridge converter is a promising topology for single-stage ac-dc power conversion, recognized for its high power density, reliability, and efficiency. This converter uses small capacitance for the ac-side filter, typically ranging from a few to a dozen microfarads, to achieve a high power factor (PF) and optimize both power density and cost. However, the relatively small ac-side capacitance can cause noticeable capacitor voltage ripple during the switching cycle. This article presents a time-domain steady-state model to accurately characterize the steady-state behavior of the converter. The analysis reveals that the ac-side capacitor voltage ripple can substantially impact the performance of the converter, particularly by causing the front-end circuit to lose zero voltage switching (ZVS), thereby reducing efficiency and worsening electromagnetic interference issues. The steady-state model is then used in an optimized modulation strategy to determine the optimal control variables to ensure ZVS operation, realize PF correction, and enhance efficiency. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the theoretical analysis and validate the findings.

Firstly, the magnetized Dickson charge pump inverter (MDCPI) is presented, producing a higher voltage gain with fewer components than its counterparts. Unlike conventional magnetically coupled impedance source networks, the suggested structure provides a substantial voltage boost at a meager shoot-through duty ratio range of 0 to 10%. Thus, it offers a high step-up ability with high modulation index and smaller number of winding turns. Hence, the proposed inverter can be an excellent choice for applications with space constraints where the high output voltage, high power quality, and fewer components are the main issues. However, in addition to drawing discontinuous input current from the dc source, the topology requires tight magnetic coupling to reduce the effect of the leakage inductance. In order to address the aforementioned drawbacks, an improved MDCPI (IMDCPI) is proposed. Although the IMDCPI employs more passive components, it delivers a higher output voltage with reduced dc-link voltage spikes across the inverter bridge. Compared with the existing voltage multipliers such as Dickson, Cockcroft&#8211;Walton, and Greinacher, the proposed structures do not require extension by adding extra stages and chains to obtain demanded high voltage. Additionally, the presented topologies solve the conventional voltage multipliers&#8217; drawbacks, including output voltage drop and significant voltage stress across the CP cells&#8217; capacitors. Input current ripple and flux density of the coupled transformer in IMDCPI is compared with its counterparts to demonstrate its improved features. Detailled experimental results are provided which verify the proposed inverters&#8217; performance.</description></item><item><title>State-Plane Centric Control of Bidirectional Dual Active Bridge Converters in V2X Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11091491</link><description>Dual active bridge (DAB) converters are a common choice for bidirectional battery chargers due to their efficient dc&#8211;dc isolation capabilities and the possibility to control power flow direction. The control of this topology using traditional linear controllers based on small-signal models typically leads to a slower dynamic response, especially during large transients.

Recent advances in the field of piezoelectric transformers have developed a variety of structure types, while the piezoelectric transformer with a spherical shape has not been researched. Here, we present a spherical piezoelectric ceramic transformer capable of achieving both step-up and step-down output characteristics in radial vibration. The resulting design is made of two layers of piezoceramic spherical shells and three layers of metal spherical shells. The basic mechanism is that the input electrical energy is converted into mechanical energy via the inverse piezoelectric effect, and then the converted mechanical energy is reconverted into electrical energy, thus realizing step-up and step-down voltage conversions. The electromechanical characteristics, voltage gain, and power gain for our proposed spherical piezoceramic transformer as functions of electric load resistance and geometry size under different dielectric and mechanical losses are analyzed. The experiments are conducted to verify the performance parameters of our proposed design, which are basically consistent with the results of numerical simulation and theoretical analysis. The power gain of our proposed spherical piezoceramic transformer can reach about 36% when the input voltage of the function generator is 20 V peak-to-peak and the load resistance is 125 &#937;. The resonance frequency of the spherical piezoelectric transformer can be varied from 75 839 to 74 221 Hz by varying the thickness of the intermediate metal spherical shell from 0.2 to 3.8 mm.

However, the subsequent circulating currents generated by the common-dc-link and asynchronous carriers can lead to excessive harmonic distortion and power losses. To solve this issue, a multiobjective optimization based pulse-width modulation (MOOPWM) scheme is proposed in this article. First, a multiconstraint vector preselection criterion is developed to reconcile the targets such as eliminating circulating currents, diminishing common-mode voltage (CMV) amplitude, and executing the nearest equilateral/isosceles vector synthesis. On this basis, the optimal vector set is determined. Then, a novel carrier-based implementation strategy is developed to synthesize the above optimal vectors set of MOOPWM. The implementation strategy incorporates smooth segmented compensation to the reference signal alongside a nonclamping phase carrier exchange algorithm, which conducts the modulation with lower computational cost. Compared with existing modulation schemes, a simultaneous reduction of circulating currents, CMV and switching loss can be achieved with the proposed MOOPWM. Finally, comparative simulations and experiments on a 300-kW PITI fed FESS motor are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Predictive Control With Linear Power Distribution of Single-Stage Multiport Inverters for Hybrid Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994407</link><description>Model predictive control (MPC) is a promising candidate for single-stage multiport inverters (SSMPI) control due to its capability to handle multiple control objectives of power distribution and stator current control under time-varying dc link. However, conventional MPC, which obtains the optimal control input by evaluating all the discrete switching states, experiences excessive port power ripples and a complex weighting factor tuning process. To this end, this article proposes a hybrid predictive control (HPC) with linear power distribution for the SSMPI to reduce power ripples of dc ports and eliminate weighting factors. In the proposed HPC, the stator current regulation of the motor is realized through tracking error minimization by considering the SSMPI as a single-source inverter, where the iteration time of the MPC can be sharply reduced. Besides, the power distribution of the dc sources is achieved by precisely splitting the predicted optimal voltage vector in the subinverters of SSMPI, and the dc port power distribution ripples can be significantly reduced through linear comparison of the predicted boundary powers. Moreover, the complex weighting factor tuning process is also eliminated due to the decoupled control structure in HPC. Extensive experimental results are presented to validate the advantages of the proposed HPC.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Stability Analysis of Single-Phase Grid-Connected Power Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988511</link><description>This article presents a comprehensive modeling approach for grid-connected bidirectional single-phase power converters controlled in stationary frame.

Triangular current mode (TCM) control enables the realization of zero-voltage switching. However, due to the considerable current ripple and variable switching frequency under TCM modulation, it is quite difficult to accurately detect, sample and control the inductor current. In this article, based on a buck APD circuit under TCM modulation, a voltage closed-loop control strategy combined with time prediction method is proposed, which eliminates the need to sample the dc bus current and the decoupling inductor current. The approach achieves effective harmonic suppression and full-range soft switching with easy control.

Passivity theory is recognized as a promising solution to this challenge, as it simplifies the large-signal stability analysis of dc microgrids by decomposing it into the passivity analysis of individual converters. The interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) approach, widely adopted based on the port-controlled hamiltonian (PCH) model, ensures that converters exhibit passivity in a closed-loop configuration. However, existing IDA-PBC methods fail to achieve input&#8211;output port passivity, preventing system-level large-signal stability due to unmodeled electrical interconnections and subsystem interactions. Additionally, these methods introduce singularities at equilibrium points because the PCH model structure is altered when deriving the unique mathematical expression for the duty cycle. This article proposes an IDA-PBC approach based on reference modification to address these issues. This controller accounts for electrical input variations within the closed-loop PCH model to achieve input-to-output port passivity. Furthermore, the reference for the converters is reconstructed to derive a unique duty cycle expression without altering the closed-loop PCH model, thereby avoiding singularities at equilibrium points. Finally, the system-level large-signal stability of the proposed control is validated through experiments.</description></item><item><title>3-D Negative-Sequence Current Reconstruction Method for DC Bus Voltage Ripple Suppression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003273</link><description>The negative-sequence components in the unbalanced grid will lead to the dc bus voltage ripple, as well as the grid current harmonics. Existing methods rely on the grid voltage, inductance, and rectifier voltage to calculate the compensation current or power to suppress the voltage ripple.

In this article, a 3-D cone model is established to describe the relationship between the negative-sequence active, reactive currents, and the dc bus voltage ripple amplitude. Based on this model, a 3-D negative-sequence current reconstruction method is proposed to suppress the dc bus voltage ripple. By detecting the point coordinates on the 3-D cone model, the positions of the cone vertices can be reconstructed, which means the negative-sequence currents that eliminate the dc bus voltage ripple can be found. Finally, the accuracy of the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed method are verified experimentally, and more than 94% fluctuating voltage can be effectively suppressed.</description></item><item><title>Partial Power Processing Converter Design With 99% Energy Utilization Efficiency for Sodium-Ion Batteries</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10989524</link><description>The wide output voltage range (e.g., 1.5&#8211;3.95 V) of sodium-ion batteries presents a challenge for converter design in terms of efficiency.

However, their relatively short lifespan has limited their widespread commercial use. Predictive methods for estimating the state of health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL) have been effective in extending fuel cell life.

This article proposes a fault detection and localization (FDL) method that utilizes a neural network based on SeparableConv2D with a dataset generated from three-phase circulating currents and SM capacitor voltages. Considering the crucial role of controllers in MMCs and their influence on signal behavior during normal and fault conditions, a comprehensive control framework is employed in two operational modes: grid-connected and RL load-connected. This also ensures that the FDL method remains independent of the modulation scheme. This article considers faults even when the faulty switch is outside the arm&#8217;s current path. Preprocessing techniques, such as K-nearest neighbors (KNNs) imputation, quantile transformation, and sliding time window (STW), are used to prepare the data for optimal neural network input. Model optimization uses the AdamW algorithm, with learning rates dynamically adjusted via the ReduceLROnPlateau method. This approach minimizes computational complexity by requiring only one training session while leveraging optimized network architecture and preprocessing techniques to enhance FDL speed and accuracy.

This study introduces a novel approach to address the OPGF problem by integrating problem decomposition with reinforcement learning (RL)-based cutting plane techniques. The proposed strategy divides the original OPGF problem into a simplified OPGF (SOPGF) sub-problem and a power and gas flow (PGF) calculation sub-problem. In the constraint set of the SOPGF sub-problem, linear inequality constraints (i.e., cutting planes or cuts) are introduced, bounding the feasible region of the SOPGF sub-problem and thereby obtaining the optimal solution to the original OPGF problem. The cuts are determined using an RL algorithm, and the RL agent is trained to maximize the rewards estimated by the PGF calculation. To enhance the efficiency of the agent training, action selection method is utilized in the RL-based cutting plane approach. Case studies are performed to assess the proposed strategy in comparison to conventional methods across diverse test conditions, verifying that the new approach surpasses conventional approaches in both computational efficiency and feasibility.</description></item><item><title>Modelling of AC-DC Voltage Control Coupling and Adaptive Fault Ride-Through Method for VSC-HVDC Integrated Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948156</link><description>During grid fault, the voltage source converter-based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) integrated wind farms should effectively support the grid voltage while ensuring the integrated system security. Existing studies have neglected the AC-DC voltage control coupling caused by the sudden change in the grid's complex impedance due to the fault transition impedance, which may lead to transient DC overvoltage, poor elevation of grid voltage, or active power loss of wind farms. A faulted grid equivalent model based on the virtual fault is established, and the mechanism of AC-DC voltage control coupling of the integrated system caused by the complex impedance of the faulted grid is found. A coupling model of the grid-connection bus voltage of the integrated system, maximum DC voltage deviation, and active power of the wind-end converter is established, and the quantification method for the maximum grid voltage support capability of the integrated system is proposed. Finally, the adaptive symmetrical fault ride-through method balancing between AC-DC voltage control is proposed. Through simulation verification, the proposed method can maximize the grid voltage elevation and minimize the active power loss of wind farms while avoiding DC overvoltage and the steady-state AC overcurrent of grid-end converter under the premise.</description></item><item><title>Performance-Aware Control of Modular Batteries for Fast Frequency Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947730</link><description>Modular batteries can be aggregated to deliver frequency regulation services for power grids.

In addition, real-time decision making within seconds is required to enable fast frequency response. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a performance-aware scheduling approach for battery modules to deliver fast frequency response (FFR) support. In particular, the conduction loss and switching loss of battery packs as well as converters are captured within a mix-integer quadratic constrained program (MIQCP). The cycle-based aging model identifies the aging cost of battery modules during frequent cycling by introducing the aging subgradient calculation and linearization. Case studies based on real-world battery data show that the proposed scheduling approach can effectively reduce power loss cost by nearly 28%&#8211;57% and battery aging cost by 4%-15% compared to conventional methods, which can also enhance the SoC balance.</description></item><item><title>Meta Reinforcement Learning Based Adaptive and Interpretable Energy Storage Control Meets Dynamic Scenarios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948374</link><description>As renewable energy becomes more widespread, energy storage systems (ESSs) play an important role in managing energy distribution and economic arbitrage. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduling methods face performance degradation or failure in highly dynamic environments due to their limited generalization capability, especially amid increasing fluctuations in renewable energy output, electricity prices, and load demands. This paper proposes a novel ESSs control framework based on Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL), comprising offline training and online adaptation phases. The offline training phase features a dual-loop update framework, acquiring a model with highly generalizable initial parameters through a multi-task learning approach. In the online adaptation phase, the model can make adaptive adjustments rapidly in response to environmental changes. Lastly, a Shapley Value-based Meta-RL (SMRL) method is proposed to perform an in-depth analysis of decision-making outcomes. Multiple dynamic microgrid (MG) scenarios were simulated using real data with added fluctuation factors for model training and testing. The proposed Meta-RL based model exhibits significantly better adaptability in various scenarios, achieving approximately 20% to 50% performance improvement compared to the traditional RL model. A detailed analysis of the contribution of features behind scheduling decisions shows alignment with human intuition.</description></item><item><title>Periodic-Enhanced Informer Model for Short-Term Wind Power Forecasting Using SCADA Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955286</link><description>Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems can collect abundant information about wind farm operation and environment. To better make use of SCADA data, a periodic-enhanced informer model for short-term wind power forecasting using scada data is proposed. Firstly, to effectively filter out noise in SCADA data, a v-p curve-based method is adopted by incorporating a quartile approach to remove sparse outliers; a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is then employed to eliminate stacked outliers from the power curve. Secondly, a multi-feature input set selection method based on Maximization Information Coefficient is introduced to make better use of the SCADA system data by reducing the number of features. Thirdly, a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is designed to extract the scalar projection of the input set, followed by fusing the local time stamp and global time stamp to build the periodic information enhanced prediction model embedding layer. Subsequently, the enhanced input set is fed into an informer model to predict future wind power. Finally, considering the multiple temporal scales structure characteristics present in the dataset, a multi-scale deep fusion module is established in the informer model to deeply integrate the features of different scales. It can simultaneously avoid the resource waste and overfitting problems caused by increasing the network depth. The experimental results, which are obtained from several deep learning methods on real SCADA data, demonstrate that the suggested approach has good predictive capability.</description></item><item><title>Computationally Efficient Model Predictive Control for Enhanced Primary-Level Management of Standalone Microgrids With Hybrid Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955859</link><description>This paper proposes a highly efficient model predictive control (MPC) technique for primary-level control of a hybrid storage system (HSS) in a microgrid with renewables. Generally, active set (AS)-based MPCs are used to control HSS-based microgrid systems, which are computationally complex. The high-complexity prevents making control decisions within the sampling time, which negatively affects the robustness of the control system. Moreover, high complexity necessitates powerful controllers, which increase the system's overall cost and energy consumption. On the other hand, less complex controls, such as supervisory control, reduce the storage system's stability, reliability, and lifetime. The proposed method is a closed-form AS-based MPC that shares the mutual advantages of both AS-based MPC and supervisory controllers with additional robustness. It thus significantly reduces the computational complexity while being stable and reliable, improving storage lifetime, and having higher robustness compared to MPC and supervisory controllers. The proposed method is compared to modified AS based MPC, Hildreth quadratic programming (HQP), and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) based MPC recently employed for an HSS microgrid application. The analysis showed that the proposed method could significantly outperform the conventional MPC methods in computational complexity and robustness, as well as the supervisory controller in terms of reliability, stability, enhanced battery lifetime, and robustness.</description></item><item><title>Analysis of a Disturbance Event With Inverter-Based Resources Using EMT Simulations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964428</link><description>Increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) necessitates newer methods of planning and analysis of disturbances. The existing phasor-domain transient stability (TS) analysis may not capture the dynamics of IBRs during fault events. In this paper, electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations using high-fidelity detailed model of power grid and one of the affected photovoltaic (PV) plants during the Angeles Forest disturbance in 2018 are performed. In these simulations, the processes to develop EMT models of power grid from traditional phasor-domain TS data and PV plant from collected data are described. Thereafter, using these simulations, the response of the PV plant during the fault event in 2018 is replicated and a sensitivity analysis is performed. The sensitivity analysis consists of making changes to the components within the PV plant and in the power grid to evaluate the impact they have on the response observed by the PV plant during the fault event. This analysis provides an understanding of the components that impact the operation of a PV plant during fault events and provide guidance to system planners on the studies that need to be performed to maintain a reliable power grid as new IBR plants are integrated.</description></item><item><title>Categorical Spatial Interpolation of Solar Irradiance for Regional Distributed Photovoltaic Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964342</link><description>High-spatial-resolution (HSR) solar irradiance forecast data is important for regional distributed photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting. Distributed PV sites are widely geographically distributed and the cost of obtaining HSR irradiance forecast data with full regional coverage is very high. Improving spatial resolution through interpolation based on limited sparse irradiance forecast reference points is a low-cost and feasible approach. However, existing irradiance spatial interpolation methods would produce large errors under variable weather conditions (e.g., cloudy) with limited reference points, because local abrupt changes in irradiance usually occur under such weather conditions due to cloud movement. This paper proposes a categorical spatial interpolation method to improve the accuracy of distributed PV power forecasting with limited sparse irradiance forecast data. The method first converts satellite-derived shortwave radiation images into binary irradiance maps through adaptive thresholding, then trains a 3D U-net model to predict future irradiance category probabilities for each grid. These probability maps dynamically govern two parallel interpolation processes: one using reference stations in predicted clear-sky regions, another utilizing stations in cloudy zones, with final irradiance values determined by probability-weighted fusion. Case studies on a real dataset verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Centralized Control for Paralleled VSCs With Grid-Forming and Oscillation Suppression Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965541</link><description>Paralleled multiple voltage source converters (VSCs) are adopted in photovoltaic (PV) or energy storage systems, and may suffer from oscillation and fault disturbance issues under various grid conditions. In this paper, a centralized control frame is proposed to suppress the active power oscillation and support the grid voltage/frequency via grid-forming (GFM) control. A virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control is applied as the centralized controller, which communicates with local controllers. The mutual damping and power angle feedback are adopted in the local controller to achieve an accurate active power sharing. The influence of key parameters such as the communication delay and mutual damping are analyzed. Finally, the proposed control is verified though the simulation and hierarchical controller-hardware-in-loop (CHIL) experiments.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Pseudo-Decentralized Control of Wave Energy Arrays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965503</link><description>In control of wave energy converter (WEC) arrays, since the dynamics of different devices are coupled by radiation effects, there has always been a dilemma between using centralized control, with optimal energy production but usually overwhelming computation, or decentralized control, with acceptable computation but performance degradation. This paper proposes a pseudo-decentralized control strategy that is effective in energy production but efficient in computation. In this method, a centralized estimation-forecasting scheme is applied to provide global information on the wave excitation force (WEF) experienced by each device. Then, the optimal unconstrained array motion is calculated from the WEF information, to serve as an initial guess of the optimal constrained motion. Finally, the constrained control moves of each WEC are optimized decentralizedly using model predictive control (MPC). However, in contrast to conventional decentralized control, each local controller not only maximizes its own energy production, but also takes into account the energy it contributes, through radiation, to other WECs, given their anticipated motion. In this way, the proposed controller enjoys the same computational simplicity as decentralized control, but is demonstrated, through comprehensive testing, to be capable of achieving performance close to the ideal centralized control across a wide range of sea states.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Energy Storage Configuration for Primary Frequency Regulation Performance Considering State of Charge Partitioning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965852</link><description>The proportion of renewable energy in the power system continues to rise, and its intermittent and uncertain output has had a certain impact on the frequency stability of the grid. Therefore, a multi-type energy storage (ES) configuration method considering State of Charge (SOC) partitioning and frequency regulation performance matching is proposed for primary frequency regulation. Firstly, the Automatic Generation Control (AGC) signal is decomposed and reconstructed using the variational mode decomposition (VMD) method. Specifically, by combining the charge and discharge characteristics of Li-ion battery and flywheel energy storage (FES), component signals of different frequencies are allocated to different ES systems. Secondly, a multi-type ES capacity allocation optimization model considering SOC partitioning is developed, with the objective function being the minimization of the whole life-cycle planning cost of ES. Finally, based on actual data from a region in North China, the proposed method is verified by analyzing case studies under different scenarios. The results demonstrate that the method can effectively reduce computation time, optimize ES operating conditions, and thus lower the whole life-cycle planning cost of ES.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Grid-Interactive Power Performance Enhancement Method for D-PMSG-Based Virtual Synchronous Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966203</link><description>Virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control is widely applied in grid-interactive inverters due to its similarity to synchronous generators. The VSG frequency variation is delayed by the synchronous swing equation to provide additional inertia support, which also leads to a slower power response. When applied to wind turbines (WTs), VSG reduces their power tracking ability, compromises the wind power capture efficiency, and affects the dispatch commands execution. The response to external frequency causes more power changes in WTs, making it difficult for wind power capture to keep up due to the mass of the rotor and blades, bring extra operational risks for WTs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hierarchical grid-interactive power performance enhancement method for D-PMSG-based virtual synchronous wind turbines (VSWTs). The power performance is enhanced by coordinating the synchronous swing equation and voltage excitation equation parameters. The grid-forming power flow and electromechanical status of the VSWT are integrated to extend the kinetic energy (KE) utilization limits to ensure the efficiency and safety of the VSWT during the KE utilization-based wind power capture regulation. The proposed method comprehensively improves the grid-interactive power performance of VSWTs, and the effectiveness has been validated through comparative simulations.</description></item><item><title>Novel Voltage Support Strategies for DGs in Hybrid AC/DC Distribution Networks Under Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10970419</link><description>According to the grid codes, the higher the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC), the longer duration that the voltage-source converters (VSC) can stay connected to the grid. In hybrid AC/DC distribution networks (HADNs), owing to the low capacity, VSC-based distributed generator (DG) closest to the fault point may fail to significantly support the voltage at the PCC through current injection. Therefore, other large-capacity converters such as flexible AC/DC converters (FACs) should also inject currents to help it. However, in resistive-inductive HADNs, the voltage support effect is related to the current phases of converters, and the fault conditions. In this paper, circumstances under two fault position categories (upstream and downstream fault positions of DG) for double line-to-ground fault and three-phase short-circuit fault are analyzed. The interconnected sequence networks of HADNs under these two fault positions are proposed. Based on the proposed networks, the optimal current phase angles of DG and FAC for maximumly supporting voltages at the PCC of the DG are proposed. Moreover, the line sequence impedance calculation method is proposed. The simulation results verify the proposed strategy. The proposed strategy is suitable for low-capacity DGs in resistive-inductive HADNs to achieve voltage support and fault ride-through.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Accelerated ADMM for Stochastic Power System Scheduling With Numerous Scenarios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10971244</link><description>The increasing share of uncertain renewable energy sources (RES) in power systems necessitates new efficient approaches for the two-stage stochastic multi-period AC optimal power flow (St-MP-OPF) optimization. The computational complexity of St-MP-OPF, particularly with AC constraints, grows exponentially with the number of uncertainty scenarios and the time horizon. This complexity poses significant challenges for large-scale transmission systems that require numerous scenarios to capture RES stochasticities. This paper introduces a scenario-based decomposition of theSt-MP-OPF based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Additionally, this paper proposes a machine learning-accelerated ADMM approach (ADMM-ML), facilitating rapid and parallel computations of numerous scenarios with extended time horizons. Within this approach, a recurrent neural network approximates the ADMM sub-problem optimization and predicts wait-and-see decisions for uncertainty scenarios, while a master optimization determines here-and-now decisions. Additionally, we develop a hybrid approach that uses ML predictions to warm-start the ADMM algorithm, combining the computational efficiency of ML with the feasibility and optimality guarantees of optimization methods. The numerical results on the 118-bus and 1354-bus system show that the proposed ADMM-ML approach solves the St-MP-OPF with 3-4 orders of magnitude speed-ups, while the hybrid approach provides a balance between speed-ups and optimality.</description></item><item><title>Finite-Time Stabilization of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines Under Wind and Wave Disturbances by Adaptive Barrier-Function Fractional-Order Sliding Mode Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10972122</link><description>Floating offshore wind turbines harness more vigorous and more stable winds, making them a promising solution for clean energy. However, their stability is compromised by sea waves and sudden winds, reducing power extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a finite-time fractional-order adaptive SMC for tension-leg platform wind turbines to enhance stability and efficiency. A fractional-order model ensures accurate system representation, while a barrier-function-based adaptive control strategy guarantees rapid, finite-time convergence, mitigates chattering, and suppresses external disturbances through real-time estimation. The proposed controller effectively stabilizes the system, helping to maximize power extraction. Simulation results in the MATLAB-Simulink environment demonstrate superior performance compared to conventional methods in terms of disturbance rejection and convergence speed. Furthermore, hardware-in-the-loop validation using a Speedgoat platform confirms the method's real-time feasibility and robustness under realistic operational conditions. The proposed approach offers a significant advancement in floating offshore wind turbines stability and control, ensuring efficient energy harvesting even under severe environmental disturbances. These findings contribute to the development of more reliable and resilient floating wind energy systems, supporting the transition toward sustainable offshore wind power.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Dispatch of Bi-Directional Power and Hydrogen Systems for Enhancing the Renewable Energy Integration in Grid-Connected Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10977964</link><description>The accelerating transition to renewable-based power grids is critical for carbon neutrality. Centralized renewable energy deployment usually forms grid-connected microgrids with limited power exchange with the main grid for stability concerns, which results in inadequate utilization of renewable energy. With hydrogen becoming an indispensable energy component, power-to-hydrogen (P2H) technology has become increasingly prevalent for mitigating renewable energy curtailments. In this paper, we present a coordinated dispatch model for bi-directional power-hydrogen system (BDPHS) that considers the electrolyzer dynamics for hydrogen storage and hydrogen fuel cell systems. We propose an improved alternating direction method of multipliers (I-ADMM) method that uses MILP for coordinated dispatch of renewable and hydrogen systems in a distributed manner. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed method for enhancing the economic benefits and mitigating renewable energy curtailments.</description></item><item><title>An Ultra-Short-Term Distributed Photovoltaic Power Forecasting Method Based on GPT</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10979247</link><description>With a lot of distributed photovoltaic (PV) stations connected to the grid, improving the accuracy of power prediction is helpful to safe and economical operation of the power system. However, most existing methods face challenges in dealing with data scarcity and random fluctuations. This paper proposes an ultra-short-term distributed PV power forecasting method based on Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Firstly, virtual distributed PV power data is generated with different spatial resolutions. Next, the generated data is used to pre-train a Transformer-based model for predicting PV power from 15 minutes to 4 hours. Finally, the model is fine-tuned on real PV stations with a small data volume. The attention mechanism can learn correlations from lots of historical power data by pre-training. Fine-tuning can realize lightweight deployment and accurate prediction on newly built PV stations, effectively dealing with data scarcity. Models with 12.63M and 103M parameters are pre-trained using virtual data, respectively. The experimental results on datasets from 3 locations show that when there is 1 mo real data, the average RMSE decreases by 37.22%, 32.92% and 10.87% compared with the LSTM, linear model, and Transformer-based model, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Allocation and Two-Level Control of Reactive Power for Balancing Voltage and Power Factor of Renewable Energy Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980477</link><description>Renewable energy stations(RES) must satisfy voltage security and power factor requirements for safe and efficient operation. However, these requirements often conflict, posing challenges in practical applications. This paper first analyzes the constraints and identifies the boundary of RES voltage regulation capability under power factor constraints. Building on the analysis, an optimal allocation and two-level control (TLC) of reactive power is proposed. It integrates the optimization of reactive power compensator (RPC) with the coordinated control of reactive resources, thereby balancing voltage regulation and power factor. From the allocation perspective, an RPC optimization method is proposed to maximize the feasible voltage range of RES under varying active power conditions of RES. From the control perspective, a TLC scheme is proposed, combining station and unit control. At the station level, the controller features a mode-switching function and calculates the overall reactive power reference value. At the unit level, the controller coordinates the converter-interfaced generations (CIGs) and RPC. Case studies are conducted on a real RES project in Bazhou, Xinjiang, China. Matlab/Simulink and Opal-RT real-time simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances both voltage security and economic efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Autonomous Voltage Regulation for Smart Distribution Network With High-Proportion PVs:A Graph Meta-Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982124</link><description>Smart distribution grids with a high percentage of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems often face severe voltage quality problems. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) presents great potentials in achieving optimal voltage level control in distribution grids with the advantage of learning without explicit modeling. However, when DRL is applied to active voltage regulation in distribution grids with a high proportion of distributed photovoltaic (PV) power generation, it encounters several challenges, such as uneven learning among controllable devices and environmental instability, which impede the convergence of DRL. In addition, traditional reinforcement learning represents the distribution network with vectors and ignores topology information. In this paper, we transform the voltage control problem into a partially observable Markov decision process, and propose a multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning algorithm based on graph convolutional networks to improve voltage quality by combining DRL with meta-learning (ML). By integrating ML, our approach allows agents to better predict the actions of other agents, thus mitigating the instability of the environment. To address the problem of uneven learning among agents, we incorporate a self-concern mechanism and a value decomposition method into the critique network. The proposed algorithm is validated through experiments on IEEE 33-bus, 141-bus, and 322-bus systems and compared with five other multi-agent DRL methods and model-based model predictive control algorithms.</description></item><item><title>FDCA-DSTGCN: A Wind Farm Cluster Power Day-Ahead Prediction Model Based on Frequency Domain Information Gain and Dynamic Trend Sensing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982214</link><description>Accurate wind farm cluster power prediction (WFCPP) is of vital significance for new power systems with large-scale wind power integration. The current WFCPP modeling method ignores the important role of wind direction and frequency domain information, resulting in insufficient use of spatial information and difficult to improve the prediction accuracy. In order to solve the above problems, a day-ahead power prediction model for wind farm cluster power is proposed based on information gain in frequency domain and dynamic trend sensing. Firstly, a cluster division method based on graph theory and progressive fusion of multiple information is proposed, and a virtual information node is set up. Secondly, a method to identify prevailing wind direction under time window is proposed for subsets, and a dynamic weighted directed graph structure is designed based on prevailing wind direction and wind speed. Thirdly, a dynamic spatio-temporal graph convolutional network model with frequency domain gain channel attention mechanism (FDCA-DSTGCN) is proposed to integrate the above information and complete the prediction. Finally, the proposed method is applied to a wind farm cluster in Inner Mongolia of China. Compared with the existing and traditional prediction methods, the normalized root mean square error of the proposed method is reduced by 1.13%&#8211;2.15%, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Assessing the Impact and Quantifying the Value of Flexibility in Transactive Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10989551</link><description>Distributed Flexibility (DF) is seen as a key tool in managing future distribution networks, but there are no comprehensive methods to quantify its value to stakeholders and impact on the network. Consequently, the potential costs and benefits of DF are uncertain, delaying the rollout of the concept onto real networks. This paper proposes a method to address that gap: a network-aware framework for modelling the interaction of DF with local and whole system markets to analyse the system performance in detail. The paper provides a set of mathematical models and algorithms to derive realistic supply and demand curves for flexibility in a distribution system, find the global equilibrium of multiple markets and services, model their impacts on networks, and perform cost-benefit analysis for stakeholders. The framework has been applied to a case study comprising a real network in England, forecast data of flexible demand and distributed generation, and the prices expected in the electricity system. The numerical study showed that DF can bring real value to all stakeholders when procured through markets; however, to maintain positive and consistent benefits to networks and stakeholders, appropriate price signals (i.e., tariffs and charges) must be designed for each network individually.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Control of Grid-Forming Wind Turbines and Grid-Forming Energy Storage Systems for Power System Restoration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002600</link><description>Grid-forming wind turbines (GFM-WTs) provide a promising solution for the restoration of wind-integrated power systems owing to their fast restart and grid support capabilities. However, individual GFM-WTs rely on external GFM sources for self-start, and their GFM support capability may be hindered by wind power shortages, potentially causing restoration failures. To address these challenges, this paper combines GFM-WTs and GFM energy storage systems (ESSs) to construct a black-start source for power system restoration. The GFM-ESS can provide self-start conditions for the GFM-WT while also improving its GFM support capability to withstand wind power shortages and load restoration transients. To ensure the stability of the restored system, a coordinated control strategy is proposed. First, a pre-synchronization control is designed to enable the GFM-WT to seamlessly connect with the GFM-ESS. Second, a power system stabilizer is developed to mitigate the power oscillation between the parallel GFM-WT and GFM-ESS. Third, to coordinate their power outputs during the load restoration, a model predictive secondary frequency control considering the stability of the WT rotor speed and system frequency is presented. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can improve the stability and security of the system restoration process under wind power shortages.</description></item><item><title>Rotor Thrust Control for Large-Scale Wind Turbine in Near-Rated Wind Speed Region</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003805</link><description>To limit the maximum rotor thrust in the near-rated wind speed region, this paper proposes a novel rotor thrust control scheme for large-scale wind turbines operating. It contains a rotor thrust identificator, a rotor thrust control loop, and a feedforward blade pitch controller. A simplified blade model is first proposed to achieve rotor thrust identification. Based on blade element momentum theory, the rotor thrust can be identified by the blade root out-of-plane bending moments. The rotor thrust control loop is then designed with the identified rotor thrust. Then, a feedforward blade pitch saturator is designed, called Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion based minimum Pitch Saturator (NDI-PS). It is realized by nonlinear dynamic inversion of the thrust coefficient curve. The simulation results exhibit outstanding performance of the proposed control scheme. Compared with existing controllers of NREL and Goldwind, power output is increased by 1% to 1.5%, while blade root and tower bottom loads are mitigated by about 4% .</description></item><item><title>Feature-Driven Microgrid Economic Dispatch via Solar-Induced Contingent Balancing Satisficing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11005474</link><description>For the multiple energy microgrid (MEMG), this paper builds an adaptive Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity set instead of characterizing its size for solving the economic dispatch (ED) problem considering uncertain solar outputs. With the ambiguity set, an electrothermal balancing satisficing (EBS) framework is proposed by defining a solar-induced contingent electrothermal balancing risk measure (SCEB-RM) to interpret the risk level for maintaining electrothermal balance under solar uncertainty. For comprehensive contingent cost targets, a multi-objective EBS is extended to refine the solar impact on electric and thermal energy resources, respectively, and provide the corresponding out-of-sample cost bounds. Using the realized solar data, a feature-driven EBS model is formulated by incorporating soft dynamic time warping-based k-means clustering into the ambiguity. A tractable counterpart is obtained by developing a solution approach on bilateral responsive affine resource adaptation, where satisfactory targets are specified by comparing with sample robust optimization as the baseline, serving as an instance. Using real-world datasets, combinations of IEEE test systems and thermal networks validate that EBS eliminates the risky condition of uncertainty while revealing the connection between targets and solutions. It is shown that cluster-wise information makes EBS withstand greater uncertainty as effectively as the state-of-the-art in most cases and sometimes better.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Mean-Corrected Recursive Estimation-Based Optimal DER Dispatch for Distribution System Voltage Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11004617</link><description>Recent advances in smart inverters offer opportunities to mitigate adverse grid impacts caused by high penetrations of distributed photovoltaics (PV) in distribution grids, such as voltage violations.

Imposing stability constraints in scheduling models is crucial to maintaining secure operations. This paper develops a novel voltage and frequency stability constrained unit commitment (UC) model for power systems with heterogeneous regulation resources, including synchronous generators (SGs), synchronous condensers, condenser retrofitted SGs, and wind power generators with grid-following or grid-forming converters. The frequency stability constraints encompass critical metrics across the entire frequency response process, effectively capturing the unique dynamics of diverse resources. The voltage stability constraints prioritize the long-term stability of buses with low stability margins, particularly those heavily penetrated by RESs. Furthermore, the proposed model captures the inherent coupling between frequency and voltage stability, offering extensibility for broader applications. To ensure computational efficiency, nonlinear terms in the constraints are linearized using a piecewise linearization algorithm. The proposed two-stage UC model optimizes operational costs while maintaining system stability. Case studies on the modified IEEE 9-bus system and the IEEE RTS-79 system validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Damping Evaluation Method of the Power Systems Integrated With Wind Farms During the Sub-Synchronous Control Interaction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11005697</link><description>This paper proposes a distributed damping evaluation method (DDEM) to assess the damping distribution0 in doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind farms during sub-synchronous control interactions (SSCI). The proposed DDEM identifies sensitive control parameters of the DFIG wind turbines at oscillatory frequencies through the explicit expression of the system's damping loss factor (DLF). It also evaluates the damping contribution by calculating the distributed damping loss factor (DDLF) for each element or subsystem in real-time. Initially, this paper presents the DLF concept for basic vibration systems and extends it to oscillatory power systems. Subsequently, an analytical expression of the DLF in DFIG-based wind farms is derived by calculating the dissipated energy and the maximum transient energy at the sub-synchronous frequencies. The DLF is then decomposed into DDLFs according to the physical structure of the oscillatory system, facilitating the development of the DDEM to evaluate the damping contributions. The efficacy of the DDEM is demonstrated through two case studies: the modified IEEE first benchmark model on sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) and the Guyuan wind power system model in North China.</description></item><item><title>A Secure Distributed Computation of Combined Heat and Power Dispatch Based on Transformation Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008674</link><description>The widespread utilization of combined heat and power (CHP) units creates a tight couple between the power transmission system (PTS) and district heating systems (DHS). Since PTS and DHS are always managed by different operators with information security concerns, there has been a growing interest in implementing distributed solutions for combined heat and power dispatch (CHPD). However, existing distributed algorithms require an exchange of information, such as CHP output and dual multipliers, between PTS and DHS, posing a potential risk of information leakage. To address this issue, we introduce a transformation-based method to mask the CHPD model, thereby masking the real economic and physical coefficients using random nonsingular matrices. We discuss the selection principle for encryption matrices to diminish the additional computational burden caused by transformation. Then, we develop an improved Benders decomposition method by introducing valid inequalities and strengthening Benders cut to efficiently solve the masked CHPD problem in a distributed manner. The proposed secure analysis proves that the proposed method can resist two common threat models in information security, including semi-honest adversaries and external eavesdroppers. Numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Capacity Planning of Hybrid Renewable Energy - CCHP System Considering Inter Seasonal Borehole Thermal Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008841</link><description>Combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems are recognized for their high energy efficiency, with utilization rates exceeding 80%. However, traditional CCHP systems often rely on microgas turbines, contributing to carbon emissions. In this paper, we design a hybrid renewable energy - CCHP system, where the electric load is provided by photovoltaic and wind power, and the heating/cooling loads are supplied by converting power to heat by heat pumps. Considering the seasonal variability of renewable energy generation, we introduce borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) into the CCHP system, transforming the ground into a thermal storage that stores excess energy during summer for use in winter.

Our approach is validated through a case study of an actual system in Ordos, China, where the effects of BTES integration, uncertainty budget value, and varying ratios of renewable energy are analyzed.</description></item><item><title>A Quantum Annealing-Based Three-Stage Scheduling Strategy for Multi-Stack Fuel Cell Hybrid Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11014234</link><description>Fuel cell hybrid power systems (FCHPS) face significant challenges due to the non-convex nature of their optimization problems, especially in high-power applications with multi-stack configurations that involve numerous start-stop decisions, introducing a high number of binary variables. To address these issues, this paper presents a quantum annealing (QA)-based three-stage scheduling strategy for multi-stack solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-based fuel cell hybrid power systems (FCHPS). The proposed method decouples the decision-making process across different timescales&#8212;day-ahead, intra-day, and real-time&#8212;tailoring decisions to the dynamics of various power sources within the FCHPS. In the day-ahead stage, global predictions inform the startup and shutdown of SOFCs; in the intra-day stage, short-term predictions refine power outputs; and in the real-time stage, adjustments are made to respond to immediate operational conditions. Quantum annealing is introduced to expedite the solution of the large-scale, binary optimization problems inherent in multi-stack configurations. A OPAL-RT-based experimental platform is used to validate the proposed strategy. In addition, a comparison between the proposed method and conventional methods is conducted, indicating that the proposed QA-based approach significantly speeds up the computation process&#8212;being 49.89 times faster than the dual model (DMPC) predictive control method and 22.25 times faster than the Gurobi-based method. It also optimizes the overall operational cost, achieving a reduction in the total objective function value by approximately 10.62% compared to the Gurobi-based method, and by 14.66% compared to the DMPC method.</description></item><item><title>Statistically Feasible Joint Chance-Constrained Scheduling of Integrated Distribution Network and District Heating System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021270</link><description>This paper proposes a statistically feasible joint chance-constrained scheduling framework for integrated power distribution networks (PDN) and district heating systems (DHS). The proposed method constructs data-driven uncertainty sets directly from samples, eliminating the need for prior distribution assumptions. It integrates joint chance-constrained programming (JCCP) with robust optimization (RO) to reformulate the original problem. The resulting model is both tractable and computationally efficient. Additionally, we introduce a novel constraint-specific uncertainty set reconstruction technique. This technique refines the uncertainty set by incorporating optimization-relevant information. It significantly reduces conservatism while ensuring system violation probability requirements. Comparative studies with state-of-the-art uncertainty optimization methods demonstrate the advantages of our approach. The proposed method improves computational efficiency by two orders of magnitude. It also achieves more cost-effective solutions than the best-performing benchmark method.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Solar Power Prediction Using Sky Image Sequences by a Residual Vision Reformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021656</link><description>The unpredictable nature of solar power generation, largely influenced by fluctuating cloud cover, poses a challenge to the stability of renewable energy systems. Considering this, accurate forecasting of solar power can lead to better grid management and operation. With the advent of deep learning models, various models have been suggested to enhance the ultra-short-term solar power forecasting performance. Given that cloud images offer more direct and comprehensive information about cloud patterns compared to the numerical weather prediction data, analyzing cloud images allows for more precise and efficient cloud change predictions, leading to a more accurate ultra-short-term solar power forecasting. In this way, aiming to enhance the forecasting performance, in this paper, we introduce a deep learning-based model, including three main blocks. In the first block, a Multi-Stream Video Vision Transformer (MS-ViViT) model is proposed for extracting different types of spatio-temporal features from the input image sequences. The output features from the first block are input to the second block, Fused Improved Reformer (Fused I-Reformer), including three Improved Reformer (I-Reformer) models equipped with a Fused Encoder as well as a new loss function for sequence learning. Finally, an Attentive Residual Fully Connected (ARFC) model is proposed for solar power value prediction. The comparison results with 36 comparative models on six real-world datasets using seven evaluation metrics confirm the effectiveness of the proposed ultra-short-term solar power forecasting model.</description></item><item><title>Dual Agent Framework for Scheduling Networked Microgrids Using DRL to Improve Resilience</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021619</link><description>The widely reported increase in the frequency of high impact, low probability extreme weather events pose significant challenges to the resilient operation of electric power systems. This paper explores strategies to enhance operational resilience that addresses the distribution network&#8217;s ability to adapt to changing operating conditions. We introduce a novel Dual Agent-Based framework for optimizing the scheduling of distributed energy resources (DERs) within a networked microgrid (N-MG) using the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) paradigm. This framework focuses on minimizing operational and environmental costs during normal operations while enhancing critical load supply indices (CSI) under emergency conditions. Additionally, we introduce a multi-temporal dynamic reward shaping structure along with the incorporation of an error coefficient to enhance the learning process of the agents. To appropriately manage loads during emergencies, we propose a load flexibility classification system that categorizes loads based on its criticality index. The scalability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through running multiple case-studies on a modified IEEE 123-node benchmark distribution network. Furthermore, validation of the method is provided by means of comparisons with two metaheuristic algorithms namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA).</description></item><item><title>Sample-Wise Graph-Based Multivariate Short-Term PV Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11024230</link><description>Reliable short-term photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting is of crucial significance for the rational dispatching of power sources and the effective control of operating costs for the power grid. However, temporal misalignment and regression accuracy imbalance of PV power data pose significant challenges to the reliability of forecast results. In this study, multivariate PV power forecasting is investigated from the perspective of forecast model samples. Firstly, the extent of misalignment of a sample is parameterized by a time-delay vector. Subsequently, the sample-wise graph is defined to relate the time-delay vector with PV power data. Then, the time-delay vector is estimated by minimizing the smoothness metric of the sample-wise graph. Finally, a sample-wise graph-based sample weighting strategy is introduced to address the issue of regression accuracy imbalance. The efficiency of the proposed PV power forecasting scheme is validated through extensive experiments on real-world datasets. Comparison experiments suggest that the proposed scheme can achieve remarkably improved short-term PV power forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Error-Based Active Disturbance Rejection Power Control for Large-Scale Wind Turbines Under Pitch Actuator Performance Degradation Failure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11027442</link><description>This study addresses the critical challenge of constant power control for large-scale wind energy conversion system under the combined effects of pitch actuator degradation and multiple disturbances. In the paper, a novel fault-tolerant control strategy based on error-based active rejection control (E-ADRC) is proposed. The approach incorporates a composite control architecture, comprising a disturbance rejection tracking loop and a fault-tolerant compensation loop. Within the tracking loop, an enhanced E-ADRC algorithm is suggested which not only retains the robustness and ease of implementation of traditional E-ADRC but also significantly improves the attenuation of low-frequency wind disturbances&#8212;the turbine&#8217;s primary disruption. The fault-tolerant compensation loop applies independent control signals, derived from pitch angle residuals, to each faulty actuator, mitigating the extra fault disturbances in rotor speed tracking dynamics. This dual-loop structure enables the turbine to restore high-stability power output after a fault. Furthermore, the fault-tolerant compensation mechanism ensures that, even in cases of part of the three actuators failure, the previously misaligned pitch angles are synchronized, effectively suppressing the detrimental aerodynamic imbalance and reducing adverse loads. The superiority of this approach in enhancing power output stability and reducing structure fatigue damage have been validated through a refined hardware-in-the-loop test.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming IBRs Under Unbalanced Grid Conditions: Challenges, Solutions, and Prospects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11027640</link><description>The penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into the grid is experiencing significant growth. Their control behavior during unbalanced grid conditions can impact system stability and protection. This paper evaluates the performance of prevalent grid-forming control-based IBRs (GFM-IBRs) under unbalanced grid conditions and proposes novel insights in a novel framework. First, we investigate the potential impacts of grid-forming control-based IBRs (GFM-IBRs) on system dynamics, protection, and fault ride-through (FRT) capability under unbalanced grid conditions based on extensive literature review and through EMT simulations in benchmark systems with IBRs. To discover these impacts and accommodate unbalanced grid conditions, we implement a generic control structure for full converter-based GFM-IBRs under FRT mode, then perform a comparative analysis of existing solutions that include sequence decomposition methods, positive sequence current-limiting methods, negative sequence controls, and current coordination methods, to identify their capabilities and limitations through literature review and EMT simulations in a large-scale power system. Finally, key challenges and solutions are discussed, highlighting prospects for future research.</description></item><item><title>Probability Density Function Control of Frequency Fluctuations in Renewable-Rich Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029151</link><description>The stochastic nature of renewable energy sources (RESs) necessitates treating power system frequency response as a random process with a nonstationary probability density function (PDF). Based upon the stochastic distribution control theory originated by the second author, this paper proposes a novel stochastic controller to improve the frequency PDF in power grids when integrating a large amount of RESs, thereby minimizing the effects of uncertainties and enhancing overall system stability. The key idea is to manipulate the controllable power generation resources so that the frequency PDF is make to follow a target PDF by using the stochastic distribution control theory originated by the second author. The proposed method can easily be plugged into existing automatic generation controls for multi-area transmission grids. The proposed method is validated via a modified Kundar&#8217;s two area system and 240-bus Western Electricity Coordinating Council systems. The simulation results show that the proposed control shapes the frequency PDF narrower and sharper, leading to a notable improvement toward minimizing the effects of randomness and uncertainty during grid operation.</description></item><item><title>Collaborative Operation of Renewable Energy Hydrogen Production Systems Considering Balanced Utilization and Extended Lifespan of Multi-Electrolyzers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029129</link><description>To address the challenges of low efficiency, poor economic performance, and limited adaptability in renewable energy&#8211;coupled alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) systems, this study proposes a power&#8211;state rolling optimization strategy (PSROS) based on a two-stage optimization framework. First, the large-scale AWE system is divided into multiple modules to reduce the variable dimension of the optimization problem. Then, a simplified module-level optimal efficiency model is developed based on the efficiency characteristics of AWE units. Subsequently, multi-objective optimization models are constructed at the module and unit levels, comprehensively considering hydrogen production volume, lifespan degradation, and utilization balancing. Finally, a finite-horizon rolling optimization mechanism is introduced to solve the two-stage optimization problem, improving the continuity and rationality of scheduling decisions at the end of each optimization horizon. Annual case study results demonstrate that, under the non-battery scenario, PSROS improves system efficiency by 9.92%, 11.12%, and 3.81%, and reduces the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) by 4.14, 5.43, and 2.35 CNY/kg compared with the simple start-stop strategy (SSSS), array rotation strategy (ARS), and rolling optimization strategy (ROS), respectively. With battery integration, the system efficiency is further improved by 0.77%, and the LCOH is further reduced by 0.49 CNY/kg.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Scheduling of Integrated Electric-Hydrogen-Thermal Systems Considering Hydroelectric Power Plant Peaking for Hydrogen Vessel Navigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11030854</link><description>Transporting hydrogen by vessels may be more cost-effective than hydrogen trailers and hydrogen tankers, but it is also more sensitive to environmental factors (e.g., river levels). In order to capitalize on the advantages of based-vessel waterway hydrogen chains, a new short-term scheduling strategy of integrated electric-hydrogen-Thermal systems considering the hydroelectric power plant peaking for hydrogen vessel (HV) navigation is proposed in this paper. First, a temporal-spatial operational model of waterway hydrogen chains is developed. In this model, the relationship between the electrolysis temperature, hydrogen production efficiency, and maximum available operational power of the reversible solid oxide fuel cell (RSOC) is modelled. The impact of the hydroelectric power plant underflow on HV transfer is also evaluated. On this basis, a flexible multi-day collaborative scheduling strategy of the electric-hydrogen integrated system is designed, where the main power source, i.e., thermoelectric plant (TEP), is allowed to operate in pure power generation mode or cogeneration mode to release the operation flexibility. This scheduling model is first linearized as a mixed-integer second-order conic programming (MISOCP) problem and then solved efficiently through a two-layer method. Finally, case studies on a modified IEEE 118-node power system verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Region of Attraction Estimation for Power Systems With Multiple Integrated DFIG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11031118</link><description>The lack of suitable modeling methods for power systems with multiple doubly-fed induction generator-based wind turbines (DFIGWTs) integrated has left the analytical description of the boundary of the region of attraction (ROA) of such systems largely unexplored. To address this gap, this paper derives an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model for a power system with multiple DFIGWTs integrated. The proposed electromechanical model is validated in a single-machine-infinite-bus (SMIB) power system and a modified 3 machine 9 bus power system with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of less than 9.5% for trajectory comparisons with the full model, demonstrating that it accurately captures the low-frequency dynamics of the full DFIGWT model. Subsequently, the ODE model is transformed into a polynomial differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model using a nonlinear coordinate transformation. To estimate the ROA, an enhanced expanding interior algorithm (EIA) based on sum of squares (SOS) programming is applied. The feasibility of the proposed model, along with the appropriate conservativeness of the improved EIA, is validated using two test systems that include multiple DFIGWTs and synchronous generators (SGs). By comparison, it is found that the time cost of the improved EIA is reduced by around 17% while maintaining the accuracy. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach has significant practical implications for the integration of wind farms into power systems, and offers an efficient tool for transient stability analysis.</description></item><item><title>Extreme Probabilistic Solar Power Prediction via Localized Sample Structure Recognition and Generalized Error Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11033220</link><description>The fluctuations and uncertainty of solar power constantly threaten the secure operation and economic dispatch of power systems. Existing end-to-end point or probabilistic solar power prediction methods mostly lack effective integration of the two approaches, and the latent error caused by machine learning (ML) techniques is rarely taken into consideration. Hence in this paper, a combined extreme probabilistic solar power prediction (EPSPP) scheme is proposed, by integrating point forecasting with extreme error estimation. Firstly, the localized sample structure recognition (LSSR) is conducted to determine the neighborhood of meteorological conditions, where feature weights of Euclidean distance measurement are allocated with respect to the valid mutual information (MI) derived by two-dimensional diffusion kernel density estimation (2D-DKDE). Secondly, with the neighborhood generated by LSSR, an improved localized generalization error estimation (ILGEE) algorithm is put forward to infer the real-time maximal second-order origin moment of solar power point forecasting error corresponding to designated confidence levels. Finally, the solar power at each temporal moment is deduced as distinct Gaussian distributions, by modifying the mean value and variance according to statistical principles. For the sake of the so-called &#8220;extreme&#8221;, the proposed scheme could maintain reliability even under circumstances of the worst ML model precision. Cases from a real-world solar power station in Oregon, USA, are used to validate its effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>A Mechanism-Based Convex Model of Fuel Cell Systems Considering the Effect of Auxiliary System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10976439</link><description>Fuel cell systems (FCS) are recognized as promising electric sources of power systems. However, existing FCS models are either nonconvex or inaccurate when the FCS is under heavy load. This letter proposes a mechanism-based FCS feasible operational area (FCSFOA) model, taking into account the decline in fuel cell efficiency and the dynamic power consumption of the auxiliary system. Therefore, the FCSFOA model is accurate both under light load and heavy load, and the average error is only 5.4% compared with the actual data. In contrast, the FCS linear model, the most commonly used in the dispatch of power systems, has an average error of 24.4% . Besides, the FCSFOA model is also convex, which is favorable for the dispatch of power systems.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Data-Driven Secondary Control for Renewables Dominated Islanded Microgrids and Field Tests</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016783</link><description>This paper proposes a novel adaptive data-driven secondary control method for islanded microgrids (MGs) dominated by grid-forming (GFM) inverters, without depending on accurate network parameters. Using the measured input/output data of the MG, a data-driven dynamic linearization model related to disturbances is built at each operating point of the closed-loop control system. Next, we develop a robust recursive regression method to learn the dynamic linearization parameter that is updated online. To estimate the lumped disturbance, an adaptive disturbance observer with an observer gain updated online is introduced. Subsequently, the adaptive data-driven cooperative controller with an iterative structure is developed. This method can effectively regulate the voltage and frequency of the islanded MG with adaptability to system changes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through both simulations and field tests in a real 100% PV powered islanded microgrid.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Data-Driven Frequency Control With Minimal Cost for Renewables Dominated Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045213</link><description>This paper proposes an adaptive data-driven frequency control with minimal cost for renewables-dominated microgrids, which does not rely on its accurate model. The Koopman operator provides the theoretical basis for the global linearization of nonlinear systems, and the extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD) is the most computationally efficient method for its approximation. However, insufficient disturbance in normal cases cannot excite all system modes, causing EDMD to overfit the estimated model and deteriorate the performance of the data-driven method. To address this issue, this paper develops adaptive extended dynamic mode decomposition (AEDMD). AEDMD reduces data requirements by extracting dominant dynamic modes through the persistent excitation condition and principal component analysis. It solves the issue of insufficient input excitation by designing the control matrix with the assistance of the control-affine structure of grid-forming converters. This paper utilizes model predictive control (MPC) to achieve rapid frequency recovery and minimize generation cost by coordinating different types of distributed resources. In addition, the stability of the control system is theoretically clarified. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on several systems.</description></item><item><title>State-Space Variation Induced Instability During Mode Switching in Multi-Source DC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051022</link><description>DC bus signaling strategy is a common solution for achieving multi-mode autonomous operation in multi-source DC microgrids. This strategy often results in two different types of mode switching, which are classified based on whether state-space variation occurs before and after the switch. This paper investigates the voltage instability caused by state-space variation during mode switching of multi-source DC microgrid. Firstly, this paper analyzes how the dynamic behavior of the mode switching influences system stability and provides a state-space switching stability analysis method. The switching process may cause the system state to deviate from the region of attraction (ROA), thereby triggering system instability. Additionally, the mechanism of state-space variation induced instability during mode switching is revealed: mode switching involves mutual coupling among the adjustment processes of different source control strategies. This coupling exacerbates power imbalance, ultimately leading to system instability. To improve stability, an extended mode scheduling control method has been proposed by introducing transition modes to address the power imbalances during the mode switching. Finally, the experimental results verify the analytical mechanism and control method.</description></item><item><title>Applications and Services of Solid-State Transformers in Active Distribution Networks&#8212;A Critical Review</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016957</link><description>Distribution systems have traditionally received the least attention in the bulk picture of power systems; they are yet the most &#8220;critical component&#8221; as they directly impact customers&#8217; perception and utilities&#8217; reputation. While transmission systems have seen abundant literature, innovations, and applications of power electronic-based devices to optimize their performance, distribution systems still require more attention toward a flexible and dynamic scheme to cope with volatile energy consumption and production. As a replacement or enhancement of the traditional ones, Solid-State Transformers can play a central role in the energy management of distribution systems towards this goal, in addition to the mere voltage conversion. This manuscript, developed within the IEEE Task Force on Solid-State Transformer integration in distribution grids, offers a critical review of the Solid-State Transformer potential, services, and technical challenges for its integration in distribution systems. Particular attention is given to scientific trends and open points in the current research that must be addressed before utilities extensively integrate the Solid-State Transformer in distribution systems.</description></item><item><title>Sequential Control of Individual Switches for Real-Time Distribution Network Reconfiguration Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11037458</link><description>This paper presents a study on Dynamic Sequential Distribution Network Reconfiguration (DSDNR), which considers the sequential control of individual switches in real-time distribution network operation. Traditional Distribution Network Reconfiguration (DNR) is formulated as an optimization problem that determines optimal switch states for network conditions. With the increasing variability introduced by distributed energy resources (DERs), real-time DNR research has evolved toward continuously identifying optimal switch states over time. However, in practical operations, the simultaneous change of multiple switches can compromise system stability, making it essential to optimize the sequential order of individual switch operations. This study introduces a new DNR formulation that integrates sequential switching optimization into real-time applications, enabling fast and stable operation under dynamic conditions. To achieve this, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for sequential optimization and develop an agent learning environment that incorporates constraints on conditional loop networks and individual switching conditions, newly introduced in the DSDNR problem. The proposed algorithm is validated through case studies, including unbalanced systems, demonstrating that optimized sequential switching prevents partial outages, voltage instability, and line overloading. Furthermore, the results confirm that the method ensures stable system operation even in high-DER variability environments.</description></item><item><title>Iterative and Accelerated Techniques for Distributed Robust Service Restoration Strategy in Flexible Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045214</link><description>The integration of power electronic devices and distributed energy resources (DERs) into distribution networks is crucial for enhancing service restoration performance through flexible power regulation. However, the complex operational requirements pose challenges in coordinating them during power outages. To leverage the potential application value of multiple resources, this paper proposes a distributed robust restoration strategy that incorporates iterative and accelerated techniques. A soft open point integrated with energy storage is introduced and optimized alongside the local DERs. The distributionally robust optimization (DRO) method is used during the implementation of the recovery strategy, facilitating the participation of intermittent renewable sources. These measures collectively enhance system resilience. Subsequently, a distributed robust service restoration framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is employed for multiregional networks, allowing the robust model to be solved in a distributed manner. To ensure the computability of the model with numerous integer variables, relaxation iterations and induced acceleration processes have been developed within the algorithms to effectively nest DRO and ADMM, thereby significantly improving the model&#8217;s convergence and efficiency. Two test systems, the IEEE 33-bus system and a large-scale IEEE 123-bus system, were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model and approach.</description></item><item><title>Meteorological-Electrical Integrated Real-Time Resilience Assessment for Power Systems Based on Deep Learning Methods</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11063459</link><description>Recent widespread power outages caused by extreme weather events have elevated expectations for power system resilience, thereby emphasizing the critical need for proactive resilience assessment. However, given the uncertain pathways and intensities of such events, along with the extensive range of potential failure scenarios, achieving real-time resilience assessment remains challenging. This paper proposes a meteorological-electrical integrated real-time resilience assessment method for power systems to efficiently quantify the resilience level and precisely identify vulnerable areas against imminent typhoon disasters. Firstly, a novel synergistic downscaling approach for typhoon nowcasting models is proposed. This method combines deep transposed convolutional neural networks and statistical downscaling approaches to provide wind speed forecasts with higher spatial resolution. Spatiotemporal mismatches between typhoon nowcasting models and power systems are then addressed through geographical alignment and multi-timescale coordination. Based on the aligned wind speeds and component fragility models, an edge-adapting, physics-informed ChebNet-based deep learning method is developed to attain efficient and accurate resilience assessment of power systems. This method calculates system resilience metrics and component vulnerability indexes throughout the event, enabling vulnerable area identification. Numerical simulations are conducted on the IEEE 39-bus system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through comparisons.</description></item><item><title>N-1 Evaluation of Integrated Electricity and Gas System Considering Cyber-Physical Interdependence</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029084</link><description>The deepening digitalisation of infrastructure has significantly increased the interconnection between power systems (PS) and gas systems (GS), rendering integrated electricity and gas systems (IEGS) more vulnerable to cyber-physical contingencies (CPC). This paper pioneers the investigation into N-1 contingency evaluation for cyber-physical IEGS to identify critical failures that pose threats to operational security. To accurately model various CPCs in IEGS, we introduce a nonlinear partial differential-algebraic equation (PDAE) model, which redefines CPCs as discontinuities and abrupt changes in simulation boundaries. We further propose a variable-coefficient analytical method (VC-AM) designed to robustly and efficiently handle these reformulated boundaries during CPC simulations. Building on this foundation, an N-1 evaluation framework is established to explore the contingency impact propagation and detect resultant violations, incorporating several performance indexes to quantify and rank the impacts of diverse contingencies. Case studies reveal that cyber-physical interdependence notably amplifies the effects of contingencies, underscoring the potential of VC-AM for real-time N-1 evaluation. In contrast, traditional methods are hindered by high computational complexity and convergence challenges.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Market-Aided Restoration Approach of Multi-Energy Distribution Systems Considering Comprehensive Uncertainties From Typhoon Disaster</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029621</link><description>The increasing deployment of multi-energy distribution systems (MDSs) necessitates the coordinated restoration of power and thermal loads under disasters. Nevertheless, existing research often overlooks the inherent uncertainties of disasters and the potential of market mechanisms, resulting in risks of over-investment and inefficient allocation of flexible resources. Thus, this paper presents a distributed market-aided restoration approach for MDS considering the comprehensive uncertainties from typhoon disasters. First, a stress intensity interference theory combined with a structural fragility model is utilized to characterize the uncertainty of distribution line damage caused by typhoons. Second, a tractable operational model for MDS, incorporating numerous auxiliary variables, is introduced to simplify the constraints of power and thermal networks. Then, a risk-averse two-stage restoration framework is developed to manage comprehensive uncertainties from both line damage and renewable generation. Meanwhile, a Cournot Nash-based joint bidding model of multi-energy microgrids is designed as a market-aided strategy to facilitate the restoration of MDS. Further, a distributed algorithm named alternating search procedure is utilized to protect participants&#8217; privacy and alleviate the computation burdens. Finally, case studies based on real statistics of the 2024 super typhoon &#8220;Yagi&#8221; in China validate that the proposed method creates a win-win situation for all stakeholders.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Heat and Electricity Dispatch Based on an Encrypted Equivalent Modeling Method of Heating Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11032138</link><description>The dispatch problem of integrated energy systems faces a contradiction between the unified modeling and privacy protection issues as various energy systems belong to different sectors. An encrypted equivalent modeling method is proposed to construct the feasible region of district heating system (DHS) considering its thermal inertia and elasticity. A sensitivity modeling method is adopted to equivalently construct the feasible region of DHS and hide its absolute state information. The relative state information and structural parameters of DHS is further reduced and encrypted through the redundancy-constraint-elimination technology and an equivalent constraint-transformation technique. Then, based on the DHS equivalent model, a non-iterative dispatch model was constructed for thermal and power systems. The dispatch model can fully utilize the elasticity of DHS and guarantee to obtain the global optimization. Case studies verifies the equivalence of the proposed encrypted feasible region model of DHS and the improvement in solving efficiency for the optimal dispatch problem. The solution time is reduced by two orders of magnitude compared to the heat-power iterative solution method. The redundancy-constraint-elimination technology further reduces the solution time by more than half. Economy and flexibility improvement brought by the elasticity of DHS to power systems are also verified.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Capacity Planning for Integrated Charging Microgrids Along Highways Considering Seasonal Fluctuation and Risk Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11037299</link><description>Upgrading highway service stations to integrated electric-hydrogen charging microgrids (IEHCMs) has become a significant aspect of coordinated decarbonization in the energy and transportation sectors. However, the increasing integration of variable renewable energy and charging loads intensifies uncertainties within the IEHCMs, potentially leading to energy imbalances on multiple timescales, thereby introducing a need for flexible and reliable options. This paper proposes a novel two-stage capacity planning method for interconnected IEHCMs that considers energy sharing. The method incorporates year-round operation based on a reconstructed full-scenario time series and a conditional value-at-risk model with extreme scenario tail risk characteristics. Photovoltaic generation, interconnected DC lines, and short-term and seasonal hydrogen storage resources are optimally allocated to provide a solution for the IEHCMs that balances reliability and economics, managing fluctuations on multiple timescales while keeping risk below acceptable levels. Numerical results show that the proposed model helps integrate renewables for future highway service stations and provides more reliable planning results.</description></item><item><title>SocioDiff: A Socio-Aware Diffusion Model for Residential Electricity Consumption Data Generation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021430</link><description>Disadvantaged communities face disproportionate energy burdens, yet they remain underrepresented in electricity consumption datasets. This lack of data may limit the development of targeted assistance programs and energy policymaking, thereby perpetuating systemic disparities and increasing the risk of energy poverty. To address this pressing issue, we propose SocioDiff, a novel diffusion-based model for generating synthetic residential electricity consumption data that incorporates socio-demographic information. SocioDiff introduces the Socio-aware SSSD process, which integrates social attributes into the data generation workflow. SocioDiff employs a two-step diffusion process to separately capture global trends and household-specific details to ensure representative and diverse synthetic consumption data. Additionally, adversarial training is used to improve the representation of disadvantaged communities. Experimental results using the Irish Energy Regulatory Commission dataset show that SocioDiff achieves a 63.59% improvement in Maximum Mean Discrepancy compared to traditional methods and leads to a 4.4% improvement in downstream load forecasting performance. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating socio-demographic features for generating more equitable and inclusive consumption data and supporting the development of fairer energy models and policies for disadvantaged communities.

The pumps, with their rapid response capabilities, can be effectively utilized as a DR resource to further enhance LFC performance. However, improper adjustment of pumps will cause the accumulation of pressure pulsations throughout the water distribution system (WDS), resulting in the water hammer effect. To address this issue, this paper introduces a water hammer feedback loop in LFC with DR to balance the power system stability as well as WDS operational safety. With the wave tracking method (WTM), the proposed LFC method enables efficient modeling of the hydrodynamic process with low computational complexity and acceptable accuracy.

However, the uncertainty introduced by data surges poses challenges to communication reliability, leading to load tracking pressure and additional costs for system stability. This paper proposes a computing-network convergence communication architecture that integrates the advantages of edge computing and cooperative relaying technologies. By deploying edge computing devices (ECDs) on the user side for edge data processing, the proposed framework mitigates the adverse effects of data surges and enhances demand-side communication performance. Furthermore, considering the limitations of resources, we develop a bandwidth release model (BRM) based on Amdahl&#8217;s Law and hardware performance limitations to analyze the coupling effects between communication and computation resources. On this basis, a QoS-constrained resource sharing mechanism is established. The dynamic interaction between the utility company (UC) and the telecom operator (TO) is characterized by using a Stackelberg game, allowing for balanced allocation of communication and computation resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy significantly improves system communication quality and economic efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Hardware-in-the-Loop Experimental Testbed Using Air Conditioners for Grid Balancing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11023557</link><description>Driven by the need to offset the variability of renewable generation on the grid, development of load control is a highly active field of research. However, practical use of residential loads for grid balancing remains rare, in part due to the cost of communicating with large numbers of small loads and also the limited experimentation done so far to demonstrate reliable operation. To establish a basis for the safe and reliable use of fleets of compressor loads as distributed energy resources, we constructed an experimental testbed in a laboratory, so that load coordination schemes could be tested at extreme conditions. This experimental testbed was used to tune a simulation testbed to which it was then linked, thereby augmenting the effective size of the fleet. Modeling of the system was done both to demonstrate the experimental testbed&#8217;s behavior and also to understand how to tune the behavior of each load. Implementing this testbed has enabled rapid turnaround of experiments on various load control algorithms, and year-round testing without the constraints and limitations arising in seasonal field tests with real houses. Experimental results show the practical feasibility of an ensemble of small loads contributing to grid balancing.</description></item><item><title>Unsupervised Power Load Super-Resolution Based on Contrastive and Internal Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11032179</link><description>Power load super-resolution technology aims to recover power load time series data with a high resolution from low-resolution power load data, providing a more accurate representation of actual power load. Existing deep learning-based load super-resolution methods require paired low- and high-resolution load data to train a model, and the model is used to perform load super-resolution tasks on the unseen low-resolution load data. Nevertheless, these approaches have limited applicability in real-world scenarios where high-resolution data is difficult to obtain, which makes training the model infeasible. Motivated by this, this paper proposes a new system to overcome this limitation. Supported by self-learning techniques, the system can generate load data with a desired high resolution without using high-resolution load data to train the load super-resolution model (i.e., the model can only be trained by the low-resolution load data). The system is also equipped with an unsupervised noise identification module, enabling the system to effectively identify diverse noise signals in the load sampling process and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments and comparison studies are conducted on a real-world dataset to validate the effectiveness of the proposed technology, and the results demonstrate the technology can achieve a comparable performance to supervised load super-resolution methods and has high adaptivity to load super-resolution tasks with different scaling factors.</description></item><item><title>Communication Accessibility Oriented Deployment Strategy of Hybrid IoT Terminals for Dispatching Large-Scale Flexible Loads in Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11032171</link><description>The global power system transition highlights the potential contribution of flexible loads as regulation resources for addressing fluctuations from emerging renewable energies. To dispatch flexible loads accurately and instantly, the power systems impose higher requirements of communication accessibility on local access services in communication systems, i.e., massive terminal access, frequent interaction, and cost-efficient accessibility. Thus, to enhance communication accessibility, this paper proposes a bi-level optimization framework to deploy hybrid Internet of Things (IoT) terminals for dispatching large-scale flexible loads by load aggregators to provide regulation resources in power systems. The framework includes: 1) a deployment strategy of hybrid IoT terminals considering various communication performances; 2) a bi-level optimization model integrating the interaction between the power system regulation scheme and the communication system deployment strategy; 3) an iterative algorithm addressing communication demands of load aggregators and the communication performance of different IoT terminals. Moreover, the numerical results demonstrate the proposed strategy can provide effective communication accessibility and further improve local access services.</description></item><item><title>Renewable Energy Following Strategy via Quantified Aggregated Heterogeneous Electric Vehicle Flexibility</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11037515</link><description>The rapid expansion of renewable energy (RE) generation brings environmental and economic benefits. However, the mismatch of the RE generation pattern and load profile introduces the imbalance between energy supply and demand, posing challenges to modern smart grids. While RE generation is inherently less controllable, the emergence of controllable loads, particularly electric vehicles (EVs) with their flexible charging and discharging capabilities, offers a promising solution to dynamically adjust energy consumption to match RE availability. To this end, this paper proposes a RE following mechanism for EV aggregator (EVA), enabling coordinated charging and discharging of EVs. First, we mathematically quantify the aggregated flexibility of EVs using an affine transformation of convex polytopes. This approach improves computational efficiency and accuracy in aggregating individual heterogeneous EV flexibility with different parameters. Then, a RE following mechanism for the EVA is formulated, treating the quantified EV flexibility set as an operating envelope. Two RE following evaluation methods, namely, Euclidean norm and cosine similarity, are used to assess the RE following effectiveness. Finally, we propose a pricing strategy accommodating various charging and parking decisions of EVs based on a combined framework of time-of-use (TOU) pricing and intraday-block pricing (IBP), incentivizing EV participation in RE following. The numerical results show that the proposed RE following mechanism significantly improves RE utilization, leading to an average increase of 62.04% in the RE consumption ratio and a 13.35% boost in average profits compared to the other two cases without RE following strategies.</description></item><item><title>ExDiffusion: Classifier-Guidance Diffusion Model for Extreme Load Scenario Generation With Extreme Value Theory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11062498</link><description>Extreme load scenario generation is essential for power system planning and security assessment. However, the challenges of limited data and complex external features in extreme events make it difficult for existing methods to generate realistic and diverse extreme load scenarios. To address the challenges of data scarcity and feature complexity, this paper proposes a novel scenario generation method, ExDiffusion, to generate diverse and high-quality load scenarios for both extreme and normal conditions, under limited data. This method enables effective modeling of the medium and tail behavior in time series load data by integrating the classifier-guidance diffusion model with the autoregressive model, leveraging Extreme Value Theory (EVT). Firstly, the method introduces an extremeness measure to synthesize load-level labels and augment the data via the diffusion model. A classifier-guidance diffusion model is then developed to reduce the dimensionality of the input features and guide the diffusion model to generate tailored scenarios, thereby reducing feature complexity and increasing the diversity of generated scenarios. Furthermore, extreme scenarios are modeled using the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD), refining the loss function of the diffusion model to facilitate the generation of realistic extreme load scenarios. The experiments on real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method has superior performance compared with existing methods in terms of accuracy, diversity, and effective generation of normal and extreme load scenarios, which demonstrates the potential of ExDiffusion as an efficient approach for extreme scenario generation.</description></item><item><title>Secondary Frequency Regulation via EV Aggregation-Based Virtual Power Plants: A Mean Field Game Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029625</link><description>This paper proposes a scalable mean field game (MFG) strategy for virtual power plants (VPPs) to coordinate large-scale electric vehicles (EVs) in providing secondary frequency regulation services. Firstly, in order to estimate the frequency regulation capability of the geographically dispersed EVs aggregated by the VPP, a joint data- and model-driven rolling evaluation approach based on a temporal multi-graph fusion neural network (TM-GCN) is designed, providing an essential basis for the subsequent optimal bidding and regulation signal decomposition. It is a challenging task to incentivize large-scale heterogenous and self-interested EVs to proactively response to the time-critical frequency regulation command. Therefore, a scalable MFG is formulated for the VPP to rapidly decompose the secondary frequency regulation signals and revenues among numerous EVs, effectively breaking through the curse of dimensionality. The existence and uniqueness of the mean field game equilibrium (MFGE) are validated utilizing the Brouwer fixed-point theorem and the contraction mapping theorem. Moreover, a distributed solution algorithm is developed to search for the MFGE, which exhibits good convergence performance across varying numbers of aggregated EVs. Comparative studies have validated the superiority of the proposed methodology in distributing secondary frequency regulation tasks across large EV fleets while maximizing VPP&#8217;s economic benefits.</description></item><item><title>Non-Iterative Coordinated Optimal Dispatch of Distribution System and Microgrids via Fast Approximation Equivalent Projection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11036544</link><description>Developing a coordinated optimal dispatch (COD) strategy for distribution systems (DS) and accessed microgrids (MGs) is one of the solutions to enhance the flexible operation of power systems. Under the premise of the operational autonomy of MGs, existing COD studies can be classified into iterative methods that allow for independent decision-making in DS and MGs, and non-iterative methods based on the operational region (OR) modeling of MGs. However, the iterative methods hardly guarantee computational convergence and efficiency, while non-iterative methods struggle to solve equivalent projections with high-dimensional ORs. To this end, a fast approximation progressive vertex enumerations (FAPVE) algorithm-based non-iterative COD approach is proposed, where the high-dimensional OR considering time coupling characteristics can be formed effectively. First, a reliable outer normal vectors calculation method along with a vertices and normal vectors count limiting mechanism are introduced to enhance the computational efficiency and stability of the FAPVE algorithm. Second, a time-decoupling method for day-ahead MGs&#8217; OR based on initial MG decisions is presented to ensure the applicability of the proposed algorithm to day-ahead COD problem. Statistical analysis verifies the computational efficiency and accuracy of the FAPVE algorithm, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed time-decoupling method based on non-iterative framework.</description></item><item><title>Frequency Reserve Service From Heat Pumps and Electrolyzers in Power Systems: A Sealed-Bid Auction Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11036542</link><description>With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RESs), power system inertia is steadily declining, leading to more pronounced frequency variations during disturbances. Therefore, in future low-inertia grids, frequency reserve service (FRS) from the controllable load sector will become increasingly critical. While much research has focused on FRS from RESs and Active Controllable Loads (ACLs), such as Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) and Electric Vehicles (EVs), the potential of Passive Controllable Loads (PCLs) has been largely overlooked. Additionally, there is a lack of an appropriate framework in the literature to determine the optimal price and quantity of FRS from each supplier. Hence, this paper addresses these gaps by investigating FRS from heat pumps (HPs) and electrolyzers, two key PCLs expected to play crucial roles in future power grids. Furthermore, a sealed-bid auction (SBA) framework is proposed to determine the optimal price as well as quantity of FRS from various suppliers, using nadir point deviation (NPD) and the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) criteria of the frequency response. According to the results, when the system inertia decreases from 5 seconds to 2 seconds, the required FRS reserve increases from 0.07 p.u. to 0.24 p.u., and the FRS price approximately doubles. Finally, the analyzed case studies show the effectiveness of the HPs and electrolyzers as well as the developed market model to improve the frequency response of the system.</description></item><item><title>Strategic Utilization of Cellular Operator Energy Storage for Smart Grid Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11049663</link><description>The innovative use of cellular operator energy storage enhances power grid resilience and efficiency. Traditionally used to ensure uninterrupted operation of cellular base stations (BSs) during grid outages, these storage can now dynamically participate in the energy flexibility market. This dual utilization enhances the economic viability of BS storage systems and supports sustainable energy management. In this paper, we explore the potential of BS storage for supporting grid ancillary services by allocating a portion of their capacity while ensuring Ultra Reliable Low Latency (URLLC) requirements, such as meeting delay and reliability requirements. This includes feeding BS stored energy back into the grid during high-demand periods or powering BSs to regulate grid frequency. We investigate the impacts of URLLC requirements on grid frequency regulation, formulating a joint resource allocation problem. This problem maximizes total revenues of cellular networks, considering both the total sum rate in the communication network and BS storage participation in frequency regulation, while considering battery aging and cycling constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the power compensation capabilities of a cellular network while balancing communication and frequency regulation requirements. By optimizing reliability and delay parameters, the system enhances energy efficiency and contributes to the stability of the power grid.</description></item><item><title>RoadPowerFM: Graphormer-JEPA-Based Foundation Model for Road-Power Coupling Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11030813</link><description>Coupling effects in road-power coupling networks (RPCNs) attract increasing attention, as they are crucial for addressing the road-power intertwined challenges caused by the rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs).

Our RPFM, by employing graph-pretraining methods to bridge RPCNs, demonstrates exceptional performance in downstream tasks such as EV Charging Station (EVCS) Load Prediction, Road Traffic Prediction, and EVCS Location Planning. By experimenting on real world dataset, the proposed methodology is proved to be generic and achieves state-of-the-art performance across downstream tasks by improving an average of 7.53% of baseline models&#8217; performance.</description></item><item><title>Multiple Time Scale Deep Expert System for Load Forecasting of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11036851</link><description>Different types of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) exhibit varying characteristics as affected by time-of-use (TOU) pricing rates for their peak, sharp, and valley periods. This paper develops a multiple-time-scale coordinated deep expert system framework that predicts the load demand of public, highway, and bus EVCSs. In the framework, the expert inference engine generates both the quarter-hourly and monthly predictions. For quarter-hourly load predictions, a stack ensemble learning strategy is proposed to combine heterogeneous neural network methods in a scalable, modular manner. Then, the multivariate data, regularized according to EVCS types and TOU rates, is processed via seasonal and trend decomposition using Loess (STL), and the daily profiles are grouped through multivariate time series K-Means clustering to ensure the consistency of the STL trend. For monthly energy predictions, a multi-matrix elastic net using blockwise coordinate descent is designed to correlate the remainder predictions (offered by the short-term engine and aggregated into monthly intervals) and the trend component (with cluster labels of ECVS types and TOU rates). In the case study, a real-world dataset with volatility is used, such that the proposed framework is implemented to show that forecast combinations can leverage multiple preferences, and short-term predictions can improve monthly performance.</description></item><item><title>An Equity-Aware Residential EV Charging Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11039745</link><description>The shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) in the near future is undeniable. With the integration of EVs, rising charging demands pose voltage challenges to the distribution grid. The voltage-based controlled EV charging proposed by the existing literature to manage the distribution system voltages usually has inherent locational disadvantages and can lead to inequitable or unfair EV charging. This paper proposes EqV-Volt charging control, which is an equity-aware, var-supported, voltage-based local EV charging control with no communication requirements. It uses a small percent of bi-directional charger capacity to provide var support to local point-of-charge voltage, and the EV is charged with the maximum possible charging power. The proposed charging control combines volt/watt and volt/var control based on local voltage feedback. A mathematical model of control is formulated, and its stability analysis, along with the model validation, is provided. A charging equity index is introduced to quantify equity awareness of charging control. The proposed control provides fair EV charging and keeps system voltage within stability limits. Validation is provided through multi-day phasor simulations in MATLAB/Simulink on a modified IEEE 33-bus system with 1440 EVs.</description></item><item><title>Edge Computing-Enabled Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading in a Local Energy Community</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021432</link><description>Local energy communities establish a platform for prosumers and consumers to share surplus generation via peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. Traditional optimization techniques for energy management problems necessitate precise models and accurate predictions. In contrast, reinforcement learning has gained widespread attention as it can handle system uncertainties without relying on models. However, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches for P2P energy trading involve a large volume of communications and computations, hindering the practical deployment of decision-making algorithms on edge devices whose communication and computation resources are very limited. To this end, this paper proposes an efficient and privacy-preserving MARL approach for edge computing-enabled P2P energy trading. Specifically, we design an information interaction framework that shares representations rather than sensitive observations to protect the privacy of various agents. In addition, we develop an event-triggered communication approach that controls the frequency of interactions through a gating mechanism to reduce communication overhead among agents. To save the memory footprint of each agent, we investigate an evolutionary training method that updates the networks using perturbation without backward gradient computation. Case studies on a real-world dataset demonstrate that our proposed method yields significant efficiency improvements while maintaining high decision-making performance.</description></item><item><title>Partial Information Perturbation-Based Specified Time Consensus With Asynchronous Switching: A Distributed Energy Dispatching Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11011922</link><description>With the widespread integration of distributed renewable energy, traditional centralized dispatching architectures face challenges in robustness and flexibility. It is essential to develop distributed energy optimization strategies to enhance the efficient utilization of renewable energy. Nevertheless, the exchange of information in distributed dispatching task execution entails potential risks of sensitive data exposure. This paper aims to investigate an improved privacy masking-based distributed privacy-preserving specified-time consensus algorithm for the economic dispatch problem (EDP) in energy systems (ESs). Therein, a privacy protection mechanism suitable for directed graphs is proposed by integrating state decomposition mechanisms and privacy masking techniques, ensuring both the accuracy of optimal solutions for EDP and the generality of communication topologies. Under this mechanism, a consensus algorithm with specified time performance is introduced, eliminating complex parameter constraints associated with predefined time bounds in distributed tasks. Additionally, an asynchronous switching law is incorporated into the privacy-preserving consensus protocol, allowing the algorithm to better adapt to environmental changes and dynamic parameter adjustments. Finally, the proposed method is applied to solve EDP in combined heat and power (CHP)-based ESs, demonstrating its excellent convergence and privacy performance.</description></item><item><title>Quantum Computing for Stochastic Economic Dispatch in Renewables-Rich Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11015516</link><description>Scenario-based stochastic optimization is a prevalent method for the economic dispatch of renewables-rich power systems. To reduce the time and space complexities for generating massive scenarios and solving pertinent mixed-integer stochastic optimization efficiently, quantum computing can provide critical assistance. To this end, we first propose the unified quantum amplitude estimation (UQAE) to generate massive scenarios with quadratic acceleration by a few qubits, after which the dimension of state variables embedded in the two-stage stochastic optimization also decreases exponentially. Then, by utilizing quantum-classical Benders decomposition, we accelerate the mixed integer master problem in the first stage on quantum processing units, while convex subproblems are solved on central processing units. Especially considering limited qubits in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, we propose to reduce the scale of master problem by scenario clustering and cut selection using the customized quantum approximation optimization algorithm (QAOA). Mathematically, we not only prove the decreases of complexities by UQAE-QAOA but also give the feasible ranges of penalty factors for transforming constrained problems into Ising models. Finally, we perform numerical experiments on modified IEEE systems to test the efficiency and accuracy of UQAE-QAOA, as well as the scalability of the designed quantum scheme.</description></item><item><title>LCL-AKA: Lightweight Authentication and Key Agreement Protocol for Power IoT</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016791</link><description>The rapid adoption of power Internet of Things (PIoT) systems has made security a critical concern, particularly as existing certificateless authentication and key agreement (CL-AKA) protocols face three fundamental limitations that hinder their practical deployment: excessive computational overhead from multi-round interactions, inadequate protection against advanced cryptanalytic attacks, and inflexible architectures unsuitable for dynamic grid environments. To tackle the previously mentioned challenges, this paper proposes lightweight authentication and key agreement protocol (LCL-AKA) for PIoT. Firstly, this protocol efficiently completes the process of identity authentication and session key agreement within a single round of communication interaction, significantly reducing computational costs and improving communication efficiency. Security is rigorously validated through formal proofs under the eCK model and comprehensive analysis showing resistance to key compromise impersonation, unknown key-share attack. Ultimately, comparative experiments are executed to delve into the security and performance characteristics of the proposed protocol. Compared to benchmark protocols deployed in PIoT, the authentication delay of LCL-AKA is decreased by at least 14.88%; in addition, the energy consumption of LCL-AKA is decreased by at least 11.28%.</description></item><item><title>Detection and Defense Against Multi-Point False Data Injection Attacks of Load Frequency Control in Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11032157</link><description>Load frequency control (LFC) systems operate over open communication networks, making them susceptible to cyber threats such as false data injection (FDI) attacks. These attacks, especially when launched from multiple points, present serious risks to the stability and security of the LFC system by corrupting critical measurement data. This paper proposes novel multipoint FDI attack detection and defense methods based on temporal analysis neural networks to increase the resilience of LFC systems under attack. Specifically, a data-driven dual-layer long short-term memory (DL-LSTM) attack detector is designed for efficient detection of multipoint FDI attacks. The method leverages a hierarchical LSTM architecture to capture temporal dependencies effectively and identify attack patterns within time series data. Moreover, a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BiGRU)-based defense method is proposed to mitigate the impact of such attacks, leveraging its superior performance in time series data prediction to ensure effective postattack defense. The proposed detection and defense mechanism is validated through simulations on a smart grid with three-area LFC systems, incorporating the practical complexities of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) links, renewable energy sources (RESs), and system nonlinearities, demonstrating its effectiveness in attack detection and its promising applicability to complex power grid environments.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Asynchronous Federated Learning for Digital Twin Driven Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11036541</link><description>The smart grid represents a revolutionary advancement, ushering power systems into an era of enhanced intelligence.

To enhance the resilience of DFAs to cyberattacks and hybrid attacks (contains both physical and cyber-attacks), this paper proposes an edge resilient control approach (ERCA) for DFAs, which integrates attack detection and mitigation. Two key modules are developed: 1) Edge Cyberattack Detection and Correction Module (ECDCM), achieving quick cyberattack detection and correction based on machine learning and physical constraints; 2) Consensus-based Fault Section Localization Module (CFSLM), which incorporates causality function related to agent overcurrent states and fault location to correctly localize the fault section in hybrid attack scenarios. In addition, the effective boundaries of ERCA are theoretically deduced in this paper, which proves that ERCA can retain resilience to cyberattacks and hybrid attacks even if undetected cyberattacks exist due to the failures of machine learning-based detection submodules. Finally, the proposal&#8217;s effectiveness and performance are tested and verified using the IEEE 123-bus system and the real two-feeder test platform with DFAs. By adopting ERCA, outages and load losses caused by cyber attacks are 100% avoided, and the fault caused by physical attack is correctly isolated with more than 97.6% reliability in 100,000 times-level Monte Carlo Numerical simulations of hybrid attacks.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Resilient Unit Commitment Supported by Battery-Electric Locomotives Under Decision-Dependent Uncertainties</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073155</link><description>Battery-electric locomotives (BELs) offer a promising solution for long-distance energy exchange in power systems. To address the challenge of random transmission line failures under uncertain routing before hurricanes, this paper proposes a proactive resilience-enhancing scheduling strategy that adeptly integrates unit commitment (UC), energy storage plants, and BELs. The problem is formulated as a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (T-DRO) model with risk aversion. To manage decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) arising from BEL routing decisions and distributional ambiguity caused by limited outage information during hurricanes, an event-based decision-dependent ambiguity set (DD-AS) with  $L_{1}$  distance is developed, which captures random failures in both transmission lines and railway networks to construct a decision-dependent sample space. Using Lagrangian dual method, the optimization problem is reformulated and decoupled into deterministic master problems and subproblems.

We leverage the ability of the LLM to perform in-context learning and create a topology-adaptive surrogate model for power flow calculation. The surrogate model is then integrated with a long short-term memory-based load forecaster and a model predictive control (MPC) scheme to achieve the optimal inverter control that adapts to frequent topology changes. Unlike many existing works that assume fixed-topology grids or require the knowledge of all possible topologies when training a model, the proposed in-context MPC method tackles the distribution voltage control problem under various topologies and adapts to unknown topologies with limited data requirement for fine-tuning. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated on a modified IEEE 123-bus test system.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Eco-Driving for Heavy Vehicle Platooning: An Iterative Learning-Based Integrated Speed Planning and Control Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980023</link><description>Eco-driving for vehicle platoons has attracted significant research interest due to its potential to improve traffic efficiency and reduce energy consumption by optimizing vehicle speed trajectories and inter-vehicle spacing. This paper presents a Data-Efficient Iterative Learning-based (DEIL) method for integrated speed planning and control, specifically designed for heavy-duty vehicle platoons. The proposed approach formulates the problem as a finite-horizon constrained optimization, that incorporates both a terminal energy cost and a time-domain-guided terminal safe constraint set. Unlike conventional optimization methods that rely on a one-time pre-planned reference speed, the DEIL leverages historical vehicle states and energy consumption data from previous iterations to approximate the terminal cost and constraint set, enabling closed-loop, data-efficient iterative learning. The approximated terminal energy cost decreases monotonically and converges, facilitating the derivation of an energy-optimal control strategy within a limited number of iterations. Moreover, the method integrates trajectory planning and tracking control without requiring predefined reference profiles. To improve computational efficiency, a dynamic programming (DP) strategy is employed to generate the initial feasible trajectory. Comparative analysis validates the proposed approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in producing energy-optimal trajectories and control strategies for heavy vehicle platooning.</description></item><item><title>Consensus Control of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations for Providing Performance-Based Frequency Regulation Service</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10985859</link><description>Energy storage plays a significant role in the modern power grid with high penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources. The flexible charging of numerous grid-connected electric vehicles (EVs) is exploited to act as mobile energy storage for power balancing services. This paper proposes a consensus-based control strategy for EV charging stations providing frequency regulation with limited communication among neighbors. The multi-layer control strategy is operated in the agent of each EV charging station. The charging power of EVs are controlled to track the frequency regulation signals depending on the capacity bid submitted to the market within the adjustable range of EV charging power. The algorithm also allocates the frequency regulation power according to the regulation capability of each EV station while satisfying the diverse charging needs of EVs. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is investigated on a typical power distribution network with EV charging stations scattered on several feeders. The quality of frequency regulation is assessed by the performance indicators specified by the PJM market (ISO in the United States). A high-performance score that guarantees the entire payment of frequency regulation can be achieved without violating the charging demand of EVs and the power network constraints.</description></item><item><title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface-Assisted Power Efficiency Physical Layer Security in Uplink Multiple-User Channel</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11059279</link><description>This article investigates the radio frequency (RF) power efficiency issue of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted physical layer security (PLS) in multiple-user uplink channels. Traditional methodologies relying on secrecy rate metrics prove impractical when faced with unknown eavesdropper channel state information (CSI). To tackle this issue, the concept of secrecy outage probability is introduced within IRS-assisted PLS. This paper formulates the total RF power minimization problem of multiple users in the uplink channel, considering scenarios where the eavesdropper's CSI is unknown. An alternating optimization scheme is proposed to address the problem via alternately optimizing the RF power of individual users, receiving beamforming vectors, and phase shift matrix, minimizing the total RF power while ensuring compliance with secrecy outage probability constraints. Innovative methodologies, such as manifold optimization, dynamic weighted quadratic transformation, and deep learning, are proposed to approximate optimal solutions and reduce complexity in phase shift optimization. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme markedly decreases RF power, with the DL-based approach demonstrating satisfactory performance while substantially reducing time complexity.</description></item><item><title>IRS-Assisted AAV-MEC-NOMA Networks: A Joint Optimization Design for Computational Capacity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002461</link><description>To cope with the challenges of traditional mobile edge computing (MEC), such as inflexibility and limited coverage, autonomousaerial vehicle (AAV)-MEC has been proposed as an important paradigm. However, the AAV-MEC systems are still facing the severe channel fading and obstacle blocking, which are fortunately expected to be solved by the emerging intelligent reflective surface (IRS) technique. In this paper, we propose an IRS-assisted AAV-MEC framework, where a AAV employs non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme to offload partial computation tasks to multiple ground MEC servers connecting to access points (APs) with the assistance of IRS. The problem of maximizing computational capacity of the network is proposed by jointly optimizing the phase shift of IRS, transmit power and computation resource allocation of AAV, NOMA decoding order, and AAV trajectory. Due to the complex non-convexity of the problem, we decompose the original problem into three sub-problems based on the alternating optimization (AO) structure. To be specific, we first derive the IRS reflection phase shift by using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and concave-convex procedure (CCCP) methods. Then, we obtain the computation and communication resource allocation by using the CCCP method. Finally, we determine the optimal AAV trajectory and decoding order by using the successive convex approximation (SCA) approach and the penalty-based method. A joint optimization algorithm is proposed for the AAV-MEC-NOMA framework. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) The proposed algorithm is efficient and superior to other benchmark schemes in terms of increasing computational capacity; 2) The application of IRS significantly enhances the computation capability of the network; 3) The NOMA scheme outperforms the orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme.</description></item><item><title>Robust Optimization for Multi-STAR-IRS-Aided Multi-Cell Communication System Based on GNN-Enhanced Partially Distributed Multi-Agent</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981963</link><description>Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting intelligent reflecting surface (STAR-IRS) is recognized as a promising auxiliary technology to enhance the coverage of networks. In this work, we study a multi-STAR-IRS-assisted downlink multi-cell communication system in which STAR-IRSs are strategically deployed within cells to assist transmission from base stations (BSs) to user equipments (UEs). We aim to maximize energy efficiency by designing robust beamforming for active beamforming matrices at all BSs, passive reflection beamforming, and transmission beamforming matrices at all STAR-IRSs in the presence of imperfect channel state information (CSI). Due to the non-convexity of the original optimization problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm is developed. Initially, the optimization problem is modeled as a multi-agent Markov decision problem. Next, to reduce interaction among cells, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-enhanced partially distributed multi-agent deep reinforcement learning algorithm, based on a centralized training and decentralized execution framework. Therein, the agents alternatively learn robust policies for beamforming optimization against channel errors, where the robust training strategy is applied for training networks to narrow the mismatch between the perfect and imperfect CSI. Additionally, GNNs are incorporated to facilitate effective collaboration within cell agents. Simulation results confirm the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its superior system energy efficiency performance compared to benchmarks. Moreover, the results reveal the robustness of the proposed algorithm against imperfect CSI and its ability to reduce the performance gap with the perfect CSI-based system.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Noncoherent Joint Transmission Based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Dense Small Cell MISO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981942</link><description>This paper investigates the sum rate maximization problem in dense small cell (DSC) networks, where multi-antenna small cell base stations (SBSs) serve single-antenna users over a shared frequency band using noncoherent joint transmission (JT). While noncoherent JT enhances capacity by enabling users to receive signals from multiple coordinated SBSs, its practical deployment is hindered by the nonconvex and NP-hard nature of the optimization problem, along with the high-dimensional continuous optimization variables. Existing optimization-based approaches, despite achieving near-optimal performance, require global channel state information (CSI) and multiple iterations, making them impractical for DSC networks. To overcome these challenges, we first prove that the optimal beamforming structure is the same for both the power minimization problem and the sum rate maximization problem, and then mathematically derive the optimal beamforming structure for both problems by solving the power minimization problem. The optimal beamforming structure can effectively reduces the variable dimensions. By exploiting the optimal beamforming structure, we propose a deep deterministic policy gradient-based distributed noncoherent JT scheme to maximize the system sum rate. In the proposed scheme, each SBS utilizes global information for training and uses local CSI to determine beamforming vectors. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves comparable performance with considerably lower computational complexity and information overhead compared to centralized iterative optimization-based techniques, making it more attractive for practical deployment.</description></item><item><title>Mitigating Phase Errors to Improve Signal Quality in RIS-Assisted Satellite Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988668</link><description>This research presents an advanced framework designed to enhance the received power in satellite-to-Earth communications by utilizing Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS), with a focus on mitigating phase errors that arise from hardware imperfections associated with RIS systems. A comprehensive analysis of the phase errors arising from these imperfections is conducted, leading to the development of a robust analytical model that quantitatively incorporates these errors into the assessment of received power evaluations. Subsequently, we propose a methodology to selectively exclude RIS elements that are prone to errors, thereby improving the phase alignment of the received signal and enhancing overall system efficiency. While this strategy leads to a marginal decrease in received power, Bayesian Optimization (BO) is employed to optimize the RIS configuration, maintaining the desired power levels and ensuring signal integrity. The research also delves into the complexities introduced by shadowing effects combined with phase errors. To address these compounded challenges, a decision-making framework utilizing targeted BO is introduced to dynamically optimize RIS configurations, thereby enhancing system robustness and performance under adverse operational conditions. Numerical simulations validate the framework's efficacy in adaptively managing RIS elements, ensuring robust signal integrity and improved reception despite variations stemming from environmental and hardware factors. By addressing critical challenges in RIS-augmented satellite communications, this work highlights the transformative potential of adaptive optimization strategies in advancing the reliability and efficiency of next-generation wireless networks.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Efficient Computation Offloading in Multi-RIS-Aided Cell-Free Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982126</link><description>This paper investigates the computation offloading problem in a distributed reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free network, where users offload computationally intensive tasks to their associated access points (APs) with the assistance of multiple RISs. To minimize the long-term energy cost under latency constraints, we formulate a non-convex optimization problem aimed at jointly optimizing the offloading strategy, user transmit power, RIS reflection matrix, AP beamforming, and CPU frequencies at both users and the edge server. Given the problem's complexity and the interdependence of variables, we propose a two-stage decentralized proximal policy optimization (DPPO) algorithm to effectively manage the high-dimensional decision space. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm reduces the long-term energy cost by approximately 17% compared to existing methods, while ensuring that tasks are completed within the latency constraints.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Secure Fault-Tolerant Formation Splitting Control for Multiagent Systems Under Cooperation-Antagonism Interactions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11028136</link><description>In this paper, a formation splitting control problem for multiagent systems (MASs) under actuator failures and communication attacks is investigated. By assigning positive and negative edge weights (cooperative and antagonistic interactions) to the interaction topology among agents, formation splitting can be achieved without the need to plan multiple leaders' trajectories. In addition, considering that communication attacks will inevitably cause damage to the cooperation-antagonism network, as well as the impact of multiplicative faults on control inputs, it is crucial to design a control protocol that does not rely on global topology and contains dynamic gain. Thus, based on gauge transformation and adaptive mechanism, a fully distributed secure fault-tolerant formation splitting control protocol is designed. Considering that the energy of attackers is usually limited, based on a slowly switching mechanism, the sufficient conditions to ensure the implementation of secure fault-tolerant formation splitting under different degrees of communication attacks are provided. Finally, the correctness of the theoretical analysis is verified by simulation.</description></item><item><title>Task Offloading in UAV-Assisted Mobile Cloud-Edge Computing Networks: An AoP-Aware HAPPO Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981970</link><description>In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with edge servers have emerged to expand service coverage. However, their inherent limitations in bandwidth, computational capacity, and energy resources restrict their ability to meet the demands of computation-intensive applications. To overcome these challenges, an air-ground collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC) network with enhanced resources is employed to improve Quality of Service (QoS). This network can provide support for a wide range of real-time applications where the computed results are critical. We adopt Age of Processing (AoP) as a metric to measure the freshness of processed results. This study investigates AoP-aware task offloading and resource allocation in a multi-UAV-assisted MEC system, optimizing the trade-off between user-experienced AoP and UAV energy consumption through joint design of user-UAV association, resource allocation, offloading ratios, and transmit power. To solve the formulated non-convex problem, we employ a cooperative Heterogeneous-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (HAPPO) approach, utilizing a sequential policy update strategy within a centralized training, decentralized execution framework to mitigate inefficiencies from overlapping UAV coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve better performance compared with the other approaches.</description></item><item><title>UAV-Mounted RIS Enabled Maritime Secure Sensing With Joint Beamforming and Trajectory Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981692</link><description>This paper considers a challenging maritime secure sensing system, in which, a legitimate shipborne radar L needs to detect in real-time the state of a collaborative unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in the presence of an illegitimate or unauthorized shipborne radar U. To address this challenge, we propose a novel UAV-mounted reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted approach, where the RIS is mounted on the UAV for enhancing/suppressing its reflected signal towards the L/U to facilitate/prevent its detection of the UAV. Furthermore, the UAV target can also adjust its flight route to move closer to/away from the L/U to improve/decrease the sensing performance. Due to the mobility of both the shipborne radars and UAVs, the Doppler shift effects of the RIS-ship channel need to be considered. In such a setup, the maximization of the received power at the L is formulated into an optimization problem while suppressing the received power at the U below a certain threshold by jointly designing the reflecting phase shifts of RIS and the 3D flight trajectory of UAV. The non-convex optimization problem is decomposed into two subproblems and solved via an iterative algorithm. Simulation results are presented to corroborate the effectiveness and tremendous potential of UAV-mounted RISs in the maritime secure sensing.</description></item><item><title>QoS-Aware Energy Harvesting Relaying Protocol for Multi-Rate SWIPT</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982044</link><description>This article investigates the performance of a two-hop network in which a source and energy harvesting (EH) relay has multi-rate selection capability and communicates with the destination at different rates. In particular, with fixed and dynamic power-splitting relaying (PSR) protocols, we analyze the system performance of a decode-and-forward (DF) EH relay network using a throughput metric with rate selection capability. It shows that employing a novel multi-rate scheme improves the throughput drastically over a single rate. Furthermore, we consider joint optimization of the PSR parameter denoted by $\rho$ and rate selection quality-of-service (RQ) parameter denoted by $\delta$, which determines the number of transmission rates in the feasible transmission range. In the case of statistical channel state information (CSI) availability, the joint optimization of PSR and RQ parameters is achieved through the 2D golden section search (2D-GSS) method. Closed-form expressions for the optimal $\rho$ and $\delta$ are obtained in case of instantaneous CSI availability. The numerical results demonstrate that the joint parameter optimization with instantaneous CSI provides better performance, and the obtained insights are crucial to improve quality-of-service in energy-constrained wireless networks.</description></item><item><title>Active STAR-RIS Assisted Covert Communications Against a Proactive Warden</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981608</link><description>In this correspondence, we investigate covert communications assisted by an active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (aSTAR-RIS) in the presence of a proactive warden. The transmitter adopts non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to serve both a covert user and a public user in the downlink. We consider that the proactive warden introduces additional interference channels, which affects the minimum error detection probability (DEP) at the warden. The DEP is derived and is influenced by the transmit power and interference power. Additionally, we propose an optimization framework to maximize the covert rate of the system while considering the constraints of transmitting power and covertness. The simulation results demonstrate that the proactive warden pose more challenges to covert systems compared to the passive warden. Furthermore, the proposed scheme significantly outperforms the passive STAR-RIS scheme in ensuring the covert performance of the system.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Beamforming for Multiple LEO Satellites With Imperfect Delay and Doppler Compensations: Modeling and Rate Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993472</link><description>To improve the transmission performance of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites limited by practical constraints of transmit power, antenna array size, and antenna gain in single satellites, multiple LEO satellites can be leveraged to cooperatively serve terrestrial user terminals (UTs). This paper investigates cooperative downlink (DL) transmission from multiple LEO satellites by using distributed beamforming, considering the inevitable delay and Doppler compensation errors that impact coherent processing. Firstly, we establish the DL transmission signal model for multiple LEO satellites with delay and Doppler compensation errors. On this basis, we design the transmitters and receivers to maximize the average signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio. Then, we analyze the DL transmission performance via deriving lower bounds and closed-form expressions for both the user rate and the average rate gain of cooperative transmission compared to single LEO satellite transmission. We prove that as the number of receiving antennas at the UT increases, the impact of imperfect compensation on the user rate decreases, and the average rate gain improves. In addition, we prove that the UT can achieve the optimal average rate gain when its array response vectors corresponding to different LEO satellites are orthogonal. Simulations are performed and compared to the theoretical analysis, demonstrating the performance gains brought by distributed beamforming and validating our analysis.</description></item><item><title>Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface for Secure Energy Efficiency in Wireless Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11026784</link><description>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a potential technology for the design of 6G wireless communication systems. However, the &#8220;double fading&#8221; effect in the principal reflection link limits its practical development. In this paper, we explore the use of active RIS (ARIS) to enhance a downlink multiple-input-single-output (MISO) system in the presence of a single eavesdropper (Eve) whose channel state information (CSI) is imperfect. We fomulate a secure energy efficiency (SEE) maximization problem which is addressed by jointly optimizing the BS transmit beamforming and the ARIS reflection coefficient matrix. We first decompose the SEE into a linear function exploiting a quadratic transform. The uncertainty of the channels related to the Eve is approximated by using the S-Procedure. Then, we apply the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to handle the non-convexity. An alternating optimization (AO) framework is proposed to address the coupled variables.</description></item><item><title>The Impact of Spectral Irradiance Aggregation Into Kato Bands and PV-Bands on Estimates of Photovoltaic Spectral Effects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11121565</link><description>Full-resolution spectral irradiance data can comprise upwards of 2000&#8211;3000 data points at a single time step. Given that photovoltaic (PV) modeling is regularly performed with subhourly time resolutions over multiyear periods, incorporating spectral effects can become challenging both in terms of file sizes and computational burden. For this reason, spectral irradiances are sometimes aggregated into a limited number of wavelength bands (or wavebands), such as the 32-band grouping known as Kato bands that is used in the IEC 61853 series of standards on &#8220;PV module performance testing and energy rating.&#8221; To test the impact of such aggregation, measured, and modeled spectral irradiance data from two sites in the United States&#8212;Tempe, Arizona and Golden, Colorado&#8212;are used to assess the impact on PV spectral effect estimates of aggregating spectral irradiances into Kato bands and into two other sets of wavebands known as PV-bands. Calculations using the aggregated spectra are compared with those using the full-resolution spectra, for crystalline silicon and cadmium telluride modules. Each of the three sets of wavebands yields negligible errors of less than 0.1% in the spectral derate factor, which characterizes long-term spectral effects. This indicates that both Kato bands and PV-bands should be sufficient for the purposes of PV energy rating. Meanwhile, a recent version of PV-bands performs best for evaluating the instantaneous spectral mismatch factor, leading to errors of less than 0.2% across all time steps for both sites and PV module technologies, while instantaneous errors for Kato bands reach magnitudes of up to 1.4%.</description></item><item><title>Voltage-Matched All-Perovskite Double- and Triple-Junction Solar Modules for Building-Integrated Photovoltaics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045357</link><description>We designed multijunction solar modules for installation on building walls, in which all the submodules are composed of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells, adopting the monolithically series-interconnected structures. Prior to considering concrete module configurations, we elucidated that the impacts of temporal and regional variations in the solar spectra on the vertically wall-installed modules are more notable than those on the modules installed on rooftops and in solar farms at the optimal tilt angles. As a result, the annually averaged conversion efficiencies for the double-junction (2J) modules of the conventional two-terminal configuration and other configurations that require the current matching between the top and bottom modules are notably degraded. By contrast, the voltage-matched (VM) 2J modules, in which the submodules yielding approximately the same maximal-power voltages (VMP) are connected in parallel, ensure high conversion efficiencies close to those for the four-terminal (4T) 2J modules even when wall installed because VMP is less sensitive to solar-spectrum variation than the photocurrents. The single output of the VM 2J modules is practically a great advantage over the dual output of the 4T 2J modules. An improved variant: the series&#8211;parallel-connecting VM triple-junction modules, in which the two-terminal middle/bottom modules are parallel connected with the top modules, further improve the conversion efficiencies under all the installation conditions.</description></item><item><title>A Solar PV-Based Compact EV Charging Solution for On-Board Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029121</link><description>This work is focused on a solar photovoltaics (PV)-based onboard charger using reconfigured motor windings. In the proposed scheme, the motor windings and traction converter switches form a three-phase interleaved buck converter (IBC). The IBC is interfaced with the solar PV and acts as the maximum power point tracking converter. The IBC reduces the current ripple at the battery side and improves the battery cycle life. Through IBC, a large amount of current at the battery side is paralleled in three inductors of the IBC, which reduces the on-state losses in the switches and copper loss in the inductors. Therefore, it is possible to increase the power level of the onboard charging system as high as that of the propulsion system with enhanced compactness of the system while reducing the cost. Moreover, the applied control strategy reduces the current sensor requirements in IBC and eliminates the proportional&#8211;integral controller, which is another major advantage of the proposed system compared to conventional control of the IBC. Furthermore, the switches are subjected to zero current switching. Finally, the real-time experiment of the proposed system was accomplished using the OPAL-RT platform for 6 kW of charging power.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Methodology for Solar Tracker Performance Assessment and Energy Loss Quantification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11062883</link><description>The optimal functioning of large-scale photovoltaic installations relies on effective monitoring of tracking systems.

Aerial infrared thermography has enabled fast and robust fault detection in utility-scale PV plants. In this article, we explore two key approaches to improve inspection efficiency: increase the flight altitude and deploy swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles. A larger imaging distance expands the field of view but reduces fault detectability and georeferencing accuracy. In this work, we study the tradeoff between inspection efficiency and data quality for automatic fault detection and localization. The YOLO11 machine learning model was trained to detect defects in thermal images, and its performance was evaluated to vary imaging distances and camera pitch angles. Fault detection remained robust up to approximately 80 m, but georeferencing error became the primary limiting factor. Finally, we conduct a UAV swarm-based inspection of a PV plant, integrating automatic fault detection and localization, and compare the results with ground truth data.</description></item><item><title>A Response-Nonlinearized DEMUX-TDC PUF for Resistance Against Modeling Attacks and Secure Authentication Protocols</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11027152</link><description>As a critical hardware security primitive for the authentication within the Internet of Things (IoT), the physical unclonable function (PUF) represents an innovative security design paradigm for integrated circuits. However, the linear challenge-response mapping of the arbiter PUF (APUF) and variants render these structures more susceptible to modeling attacks due to their delayed linear structure. In this article, we propose a nonlinearized demultiplexer time-to-digital converter (DEMUX-TDC) PUF. This PUF uses a quantized delay difference technique to alter the traditional response generation mechanism, demonstrating robust resistance against modeling attacks. First, the proposed PUF employs a segmented APUF variant structure configured in both front and back segmented modes to generate a source of delay difference entropy. Additionally, the scheme incorporates a multilayer differential tapped TDC circuit to quantize the delay differences into digital codes, followed by a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) to obfuscate the final output response. We further propose a highly secure mutual authentication protocol based on reconfigurable PUF, by leveraging the characteristics of front and back segments of the PUF&#8217;s challenge. Evaluation of the proposed scheme on the implementation of Xilinx Virtex-7 and Spartan-6 field-programmable gate array (FPGA) demonstrates that the uniqueness and uniformity can reach ideal value, in the condition of prediction accuracy across six modeling attacks remaining around 50%.</description></item><item><title>A 4.447 mW at 100 MHz and 49.62% Uniqueness XNOR&#8211;XOR RO PUF ASIC Using 180-nm CMOS Process for IoT Security Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988905</link><description>Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are increasingly recognized as a key technology for enhancing hardware and the Internet of Things (IoT) security.

This article presents an elaborated RISC-V-based EEG classification system, targeting on classification tasks, such as emotion recognition and seizure detection. A hardware-friendly convolutional neural network (CNN) model is proposed, which enables automatic extraction of advanced features from EEG signals through combined temporal and spatial convolution operations. A dedicated CNN accelerator is designed to efficiently execute fundamental operations, including convolution, pooling, and fully connected computations.

Based on behavioral-level simulations and prototype chip testing, ultralow-power operation and significant chip area reduction are achieved. This novel switching scheme employs voltage level shifting instead of charge redistribution for the two most significant bit (MSB) decisions, thus eliminating switching power consumption. For the remaining bit decision, the technique minimizes reference voltage transitions while involving only a single capacitor in each switching. By employing the proposed switching scheme, the capacitance spread of capacitive digital-to-analog converter (CDAC) is reduced from conventional  $2^{n-1}$  to  $2^{n-3}$ , which reduces the CDAC area, relaxes capacitor matching requirements, and improves matching linearity. A prototype of the proposed ADC was designed and fabricated in SMIC 180-nm CMOS technology. The chip operates with a 0.6-V supply voltage and consumes 45-nW power at a sampling rate of 20 kS/s. The measurement results also show the signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 56.4 dB, the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 70.4 dB, and the ENOB of 9.26 are achieved.

A high-speed hybrid-loop residue amplifier (RA) is proposed with a settling time of less than 150 ps, while a non-symmetrical pipeline timing utilizing a 25% duty cycle clock is used to increase the TD quantization time and the settling time margin of the RA. A low-power and small-area gated-ring-oscillator-based TD backend is employed, which operates at 4-GS/s with 6-bit resolution. The prototype hybrid ADC occupies an active area of 0.0114 mm2. Under a 1-V power supply and Nyquist input, the chip achieves a measured ENOB of 6.46 bits at a conversion rate of 4 GS/s, while the power consumption is 10.6 mW and the FoMw is 29.9 fJ/conversion-step.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Efficient Four-Channel Interface ASIC for IRFPAs With Optimized Resistor-Sharing Technique Achieving 88.1-dB SNDR</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11004049</link><description>This article presents a four-channel interface application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for infrared focal plane arrays (IRFPAs), where each channel integrates a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) with wide-range input common-mode adjustment capability and a 16-bit hybrid analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with resistor-sharing technique (RST). The flash stage of the ADC performs 5-bit most significant bits (MSBs) conversion, whose results are transferred to thermometer-coded capacitor array in the successive approximation register (SAR) stage, ensuring high linearity while maintaining conversion speed. This hybrid architecture of the ADC uses the RST by sharing the resistor ladder between the flash and SAR stages, reducing power consumption. The interface ASIC fabricated in the 180-nm CMOS technology achieves an input common-mode adjustment range of 0.169&#8211;3.269 V. Operating at 2 MS/s with a 3.3-V supply, it achieves an 88.1-dB signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and consumes 13.97 mW/channel. The Schreier figure-of-merit (FoM) of the ADC reaches 171.2 dB/channel.

In this study, we present a CMOS clock generator that operates at high operating voltage, achieves low frequency, and exhibits low power (LP) consumption, thus obviating the need for scaling-unfriendly step-down converters. The avoidance of step-down converters, which require passive components in their design, facilitates the development of scaling-friendly IoTs. The architecture of the prototype chip is composed of a voltage stacking and charge recycling design, which is achieved by the implementation of stacked oscillator and multiple frequency dividers in a configuration. The fabrication of the prototype chip is conducted using a 65-nm CMOS process. This work presents two configurations that are based on the concept of voltage stacking. The first configuration prioritizes LP consumption, yielding a clock generation of 2.09 Hz with a power of 0.22 nW at a voltage supply of 1.2 V and an operating range of 1.2&#8211;2.2 V. Notably, this configuration represents the lowest power achieved at a foundry-recommended nominal voltage in a sub-10-Hz clock generator. Another configuration is oriented toward generating low-frequency output signals, and the test chip attains an output frequency of 0.079 Hz and a supply voltage range of 0.88&#8211;1.3 V. The proposed architecture exhibits potential benefits in advanced technology nodes, particularly in the context of technology scaling.</description></item><item><title>A Dual-Multiplication-Mode and Reconfigurable Digital Compute-in-Memory Macro Using Precharge-Controlled 4T1C eDRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11005471</link><description>Recently, the demand for supporting diverse artificial intelligence (AI) operations within a single edge device has been increasing. However, existing compute-in-memory (CIM) architectures for edge AI are often optimized only for specific lightweight networks, limiting their adaptability. While digital CIM (DCIM) offers high accuracy and exhibits low sensitivity to variations in process, voltage, and temperature, their area and energy inefficiencies remain significant barriers to deployment in edge devices. This study proposes an embedded dynamic random access memory (eDRAM)-based dual-multiplication-mode (DMM) DCIM macro leveraging precharge-controlled 4T1C gain cells. The proposed design enables the AND/XNOR dual-multiplication mode within a 4T1C cell through controlled precharge states. It supports a wide range of neural networks for edge AI, including INT1&#8211;8 operations and binary neural networks, such as XNOR-net. An area-efficient adder tree structure reduced the transistor count by 19% compared to conventional adder trees. This structure also accommodates 1&#8211;8-bit signed and unsigned inputs and weights without wasting cells, enhancing reconfigurability. Fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS process, the 16-kb DMM-DCIM prototype chip demonstrated area and energy efficiencies of 28.9 TOPS/mm2 and 190.3 TOPS/W for 4b&#8211;4b multiply-accumulate operations, respectively.</description></item><item><title>ReHIT: Reconfigurable High-Radix Iterative-Taylor Architecture for Ultraprecise Logarithm/Exponential Functions in FPGA-Based Softmax Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11005485</link><description>The softmax function, as a pivotal component in neural network accelerators, imposes stringent demands on the precision-efficiency tradeoff for logarithmic and exponential computations. This article presents reconfigurable high-radix iterative-Taylor (ReHIT) architecture, a novel hardware framework that synergistically integrates high-radix iterative normalization with optimized Taylor expansion to achieve subunit-in-the-last-place (ULP) precision in floating-point transcendental functions. Our key innovation lies in the hierarchical pretreatment mechanism where high-radix iterations (radix-256/512) systematically decompose input operands into normalized subdomains, enabling subsequent quadratic Taylor approximations with guaranteed convergence. This codesign methodology reduces polynomial orders by 33% compared to conventional approaches while eliminating resource-intensive division operations through shift-and-add transformations. The implemented ReHIT-logarithm (ReHIT-L) and ReHIT-exponential (ReHIT-E) modules demonstrate configurable precision scaling from half to double precision (FP16/32/64), validated through exhaustive error analysis over 1 000 000 random test vectors with worst case errors bounded at 0.78 ULP. Field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementations on Arria 10/Virtex-7 platforms can achieve up to 13.8% logic resources reduction and 32.3% latency improvement over state-of-the-art designs, with post-synthesis results in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) 28-nm showing up to  $1.34\times $  giga operations per second (GOPS)/W energy efficiency and  $3.97\times $  GOPS/mm2 area efficiency for softmax acceleration.

This article introduces an energy-efficient neural rendering coprocessor that implements the popular and widely used instant neural graphics primitive (Instant-NGP) algorithm. In particular, we address the challenges of limited resources for deploying Instant-NGP on edge by proposing a dedicated architecture, which incorporates three main innovations: 1) we optimize occupancy grid queries in the ray marching module by partitioning the grid and decoupling the query process from sampling point generation, which improves both efficiency and memory usage; 2) we introduce a bilinked list-based ray switching strategy, which ensures continuous pipeline utilization to overcome the inefficiencies caused by sequential processing; and 3) we optimize the hash encoding process by incorporating quantization-aware training (QAT), enabling the hash table to fit into on-chip memory, thereby improving performance on resource-constrained devices. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture, we design and fabricate a proof-of-concept chip using 40-nm CMOS technology and develop a testing system to evaluate its performance. Measurement results validate the advantages of the proposed design, showing that our chip achieves superior energy efficiency compared to both server and edge graphics processing units (GPUs), as well as other state-of-the-art neural rendering chip designs.</description></item><item><title>A General-Purpose Computing Core With Cooperative Motion Detection and Feature Extraction for Always-On PWM Image Sensors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11049953</link><description>This article presents a mixed-signal general-purpose computing core designed to support real-time inference applications in always-on low-power pulsewidth modulation (PWM) CMOS image sensors (CISs), functioning as a processing-in-sensor (PIS) circuit. This core can be integrated into the columns of CISs to perform low-power edge processing on images, without affecting the pixel fill factor and imaging quality. It employs a coordinated mechanism in which motion detection (MD) triggers the activation of feature extraction (FE), thereby achieving an organic integration of MD and FE functionalities, and maximizing the system&#8217;s power efficiency. MD is implemented via in-column frame difference (FD), while FE is performed using a programmable-weight  $3\times 3$  convolution, a rectified linear unit activation function, and a  $2\times 2$  max-pooling (MP) operation. Both functionalities are computed based on real-time PWM signals from the CIS and the principle of current integration, with partial circuit reuse achieved through different switching operations. A 0.8-V computing core prototype, with an area of 720 &#215; 272  $\mu$ m, was fabricated and verified using 0.18- $\mu $ m standard CMOS technology. The experimental results at an image frame rate of 250 fps demonstrated an average power consumption of  $5.23~\mu $ W for MD and  $17.53~\mu $ W for FE. The prototype core computes the first two layers of an ultra lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) for the task of MNIST digit classification, achieving an accuracy loss of only 0.86% compared to the ideal scenario. This analog computing core can be used in multimode, low-power, edge-intelligent vision sensors.</description></item><item><title>A 1.28-&#956;W Heart-Rate SoC Achieving 99.68% QRS Detection Accuracy for Long-Term Continuous Cardiac Monitoring Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045431</link><description>This work presents an ultralow-power heart-rate system-on-a-chip (HR-SoC) for long-term continuous cardiac monitoring applications. A modified QRS-complex detection algorithm, verified on the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database, achieves a sensitivity (SE) of 99.99%, a positive predictive rate (PPR) of 99.68%, and an accuracy (ACC) of 99.68% while significantly reducing the power consumption compared to the conventional Pan-Tompkins algorithm. The system outputs averaged HRs (AHRs) and operates in an interrupt-driven architecture, dramatically saving memory resources and power consumption. The HR-SoC integrates an analog front end (AFE) for electrocardiograph (ECG) recording and a digital signal processing (DSP) back end for QRS detection, storage, and system scheduling and configuration. The AFE strikes a compromise among noise, linearity, and power consumption. Fabricated in 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS technology, the HR-SoC features a compact area of 1.55 mm2. When operating at a 1-V power supply, it consumes only  $1.28~\mu $ W in the AHR monitoring mode, with  $0.48~\mu $ W consumed by the AFE and  $0.8~\mu $ W by the DSP back end.</description></item><item><title>A 56-Gb/s, 6.3-pJ/bit PAM-4 DFB Laser Driver Incorporating Asymmetric Equalization and Integrated CDR in 28 nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11049954</link><description>This article presents a 56-Gb/s distributed feedback (DFB) laser driver integrated with a PAM-4 clock and data recovery (CDR). A mixed-signal digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is adopted for power-efficient linear driving. With the help of the CDR, high-speed PAM-4 input is digitized into thermometer code, which is processed in NRZ format along the data path before summation at the output node. In this way, higher modulation linearity is realized by independently adjusting the weight of each slice. A dc-coupled differential drive stage is devised to improve signal integrity and energy efficiency at high speed. Employing a fractional-UI delay asymmetric feed-forward equalization (FFE) extends the laser&#8217;s bandwidth while the nonlinearity is compensated. The proposed driver is fabricated in 28-nm CMOS and co-packaged with a DFB laser diode. Measurement results show the modulated optical output reaches a 56-Gb/s data rate and consumes 353-mW power, thus corresponding to the energy efficiency of 6.3 pJ/bit, including the integrated CDR.</description></item><item><title>A Compound Timing Detection of Both Data Transition and Path Activation for Reliable In Situ Error Detection and Correction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11040007</link><description>Timing error detection and correction (EDAC) in resilient circuits helps eliminate excess timing margins. However, it faces misdetection risks when critical paths (CPs) remain inactive. We propose a 15-transistor timing error and path-activation detector (TEPD) capable of detecting both timing violations in late-arriving signals and CP activation, with robust operation down to 0.33 V. Regarding circuit-level error correction, we introduce an error-correcting flip-flop (ECFF), leveraging time-borrowing for zero-cycle response latency without requiring pipeline refresh. The custom-optimized ECFF adds only six transistors, increasing delay, dynamic power, and static power by 15%, 11%, and 14%, respectively, compared with a standard flip-flop, ensuring efficient error correction with minimal cost. A system-level voltage tuning strategy is further developed to handle continuous timing errors, ensuring robust adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) operation. Implemented on a neural network (NN) accelerator in the 28-nm CMOS, the system operates across a wide voltage range from 0.54 to 0.9 V. It achieves up to 52% power gain or 123% frequency gain at the near-threshold region, with negligible area and power overhead compared with the margined baseline.</description></item><item><title>TUTPFL: Triple Node Upset-Tolerant and Single-Event Transient-Filtered Low-Power Latch With HSPICE and FPGA-Based Verifications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021686</link><description>In nanoscale CMOS technology, harsh radiations in the environment can now easily cause soft errors, e.g., single-event transients (SETs) and triple node upsets (TNUs), severely affecting the reliability of space applications. In this article, TNUs tolerant and SET-pulses filtered latch (TUTPFL) with low power is proposed, which comprises from four input-stage C-elements (CEs), four inverters, and three output-stage CEs. The CEs&#8217; delay differential enables the TUTPFL latch to effectively filter SET-pulse, while the CEs&#8217; multilevel error-interception property enables the TUTPFL latch to tolerate any possible TNU. The results of HSPICE-based simulations and FPGA-based emulations demonstrate the TNU tolerance and SET filterability of the TUTPFL latch. Meanwhile, compared to the alternative radiation-hardened latches, the TUTPFL latch reduces power dissipation by roughly 20.43% on average.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Approximate Multipliers With Merits Balance for Digital Processing and Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11086519</link><description>In this article, hybrid approximate multiplier (HAMs) designs based on the combination of logarithmic multiplication and piecewise linear (PWL) fitting are proposed. After extracting the exponent and mantissa of the input operands, two new variables are introduced to perform spatial mixed linear fitting on the 3-D surface of the mantissa product in different regions. Limited power-of-2 elements in line slopes make the multivariable mixed PWL computational simple and friendly to logic circuit complexity. With iterative adjustment of the slopes and bias of the lines in the PWL calculation, the relative error distance (RED) distribution is well balanced and zero concentrated. In addition, we detail the logic architecture to implement approximate hybrid accumulation and error-tolerant complement conversions. In the 45-nm library-based performance comparison, the proposed multipliers&#8212;mainly 16-, 8-, and 32-bit floating-point multipliers&#8212;exhibit &gt;55% power, &gt;23% delay, and &gt;43% area reductions compared with the exact multiplier. In addition, they outperform other state-of-the-art designs in terms of delay, power, area, and error, as evaluated by the joint delay&#8211;power&#8211;area product (PPA) and mean RED (MRED). In case experiments, the proposed multipliers perform nearly equivalently to the exact multiplier in error-tolerant digital processing and neural network computations.</description></item><item><title>Efficiency Optimization of Voltage-Mode CMOS Digital Doherty Power Amplifiers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073819</link><description>This article analyzes the behavior of a single supply asymmetric Doherty power amplifier, made of two switched-capacitor power amplifiers (SCPAs) and a power combining network. The proposed analysis shows that there is an optimal power partition between the two SCPAs that maximizes the efficiency at each output power level. The optimal control of the PA leads to two power back-off (PBO) efficiency peaks, whose magnitude depends on the size of the switches of each SCPA and on the matching network design. The optimization of both switch sizing and output network design is carried out analytically. The achieved theoretical results are then verified by transistor-level simulations. They have also been validated by measurements performed on a prototype, fully integrated in a commercial 22-nm CMOS technology, at an operation frequency of 2.3 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A 0.97 nJ/Conversion BJT-Based Temperature Sensor With a Low-Power Two-Stage Dynamic Comparator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11096720</link><description>This article presents a low-power fully CMOS temperature sensor in a 65 nm process, suitable for monitoring the battery-powered application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) designs. The circuit converts a proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) current to a complementary-to-absolute-temperature (CTAT) binary code using a low-power time-to-digital converter to-digital converter (TDC). To enhance conversion efficiency, we introduce a two-stage dynamic comparator that consumes 40% less power than conventional designs by enabling the preamplifier only when precise detection of the integration stop time is required. The 0.16  $\text{mm}^{2}$  prototype consumes only 0.97 nJ/conversion, achieving a resolution figure of merit (FoM) of 0.018 nJ  $\cdot $   $\text{K}^{2}$ .

Current works mainly focus on prior off-chip or intuitive/heuristic access optimization and lack a theoretically holistic analysis. Therefore, this article proposes an overall on- and off-chip communication-minimized CNN acceleration framework. First, we derive the layer-wise off-chip communication analytic expressions (AEs) based on different data reuse strategies and give their lower bound (LB), reaching 6%&#8211;18% lower than that proposed in work CLB. For practical off-chip access, we achieve 22%&#8211;35% reduction compared with the adaptive access strategy of work Sense and 11% with the dataflow selection approach of work Versa. Second, on-chip communication AEs and LB are derived within the tile range, and overall on- and off-chip access analysis is conducted to obtain the unified energy LB (ELB). Guided by our theoretical model, we design window-primitive (WP) dataflow and an energy-efficient systolic-cross-line (SCL) CNN accelerator. Finally, a holistic framework, Comma, is proposed to streamline the workflow of model-architecture co-design. SCL is implemented in 65-nm technology and achieves  $4.2\times $  pJ/Multiply and ACcumulation (MAC) energy reduction at  $1.4\times $  less on-chip memory area compared with Eyeriss, and 1.4~ $1.9\times $  reduction at 3~ $4\times $  less area compared with work CLB; as for systolic architecture, Sense, it achieves 29%&#8211;44% energy reduction with 4% area overhead. For the near memory processing (NMP) situation, we reduce around  $2\times $  access energy compared with the systolic NMP architecture.</description></item><item><title>ASiM: Modeling and Analyzing Inference Accuracy of SRAM-Based Analog CiM Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11152313</link><description>Static random-access memory (SRAM)-based analog compute-in-memory (ACiM) demonstrates promising energy efficiency for deep neural network (DNN) processing. Nevertheless, efforts to optimize efficiency frequently compromise accuracy, and this trade-off remains insufficiently studied due to the difficulty of performing full-system validation. Specifically, existing simulation tools rarely target SRAM-based ACiM and exhibit inconsistent accuracy predictions, highlighting the need for a standardized, SRAM compute-in-memory (CiM) circuit-aware evaluation methodology. This article presents ASiM, a simulation framework for evaluating inference accuracy in SRAM-based ACiM systems. ASiM captures critical effects in SRAM-based analog compute in memory systems, such as analog-to-digital converter (ADC) quantization, bit-parallel encoding, and analog noise, which must be modeled with high fidelity due to their distinct behavior in charge-domain architectures compared to other memory technologies. ASiM supports a wide range of modern DNN workloads, including CNN and Transformer-based models such as ViT, and scales to large-scale tasks like ImageNet classification. Our results indicate that bit-parallel encoding can improve energy efficiency with only modest accuracy degradation; however, even 1 LSB of analog noise can significantly impair inference performance, particularly in complex tasks such as ImageNet. To address this, we explore hybrid analog-digital execution and majority voting schemes, both of which enhance robustness without negating energy savings. ASiM bridges the gap between hardware design and inference performance, offering actionable insights for energy-efficient, high-accuracy ACiM deployment.

For rapid prototyping of these types of application-specific processors, designers leverage hardware (HW)/software (SW) co-design to create hardware implementations and retarget the compiler using a high-level description of the instruction set extension. Ideally, the architecture description should be flexible enough to support both hardware generation and compiler retargeting from the same description format. The challenge with these methods lies in coupling hardware extensions with the processor core, because using microarchitecture-specific interfaces leads to low design reuse and increased verification effort. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a HW/SW co-design toolset capable of adapting to a user-defined architecture description that captures the instruction set extension semantics. Based on the architecture description, the toolset can both retarget the compiler and generate co-processors interfacing with the Core-V eXtension interface (CV-X-IF) and Rocket custom co-processor interface (RoCC) protocols that are widely used standard interfaces for RISC-V processors. To demonstrate our methods, we integrate the co-processors with two different variations of CVA6 and Rocket core. The resulting execution time reduction is up to 40% on average, with an area overhead of 8% for the CVA6. For the Rocket core, the execution time reduction is 27% with a 6% area overhead.</description></item><item><title>A Secure-by-Design Hardware/Operating System as a Substrate for Trustworthy Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11068203</link><description>Nowadays, digital devices like sensors, cell phones, and home servers are deeply embedded in our world to make our daily lives easier. Since we heavily rely on these systems, it is crucial to guarantee their correct functionality and to ensure security and privacy properties. As systems become increasingly complex, it is difficult to maintain security since it necessitates a thorough understanding of all functionalities in hardware and software. Complexity may lead to vulnerabilities that malicious components can exploit. These components can compromise security features provided by the processing cores and the operating system (OS), jeopardizing the overall trustworthiness of the system. In this article, we provide a secure-by-default hardware/OS co-design to build a substrate for trustworthy computing in digital devices. The design is based on a tiled architecture that can integrate untrusted hardware components. Instead of relying on isolation mechanisms of potentially malicious components, isolation is achieved by dedicated and independent hardware components called trusted communication units (TCUs). By keeping the attack surface small and isolating all components by default, malicious hardware and software are restricted in access permissions and, hence, cannot easily break the system&#8217;s security. We implemented a TCU-based multiprocessor architecture in a silicon research chip, called Masur23, and ran transfer workloads and selected portions of the microkernel-based OS M3. Our measurements demonstrate the feasibility of such a hardware/OS co-design for trustworthy computing. Compared to the entire chip implementation, security features require minimal latency, area, and power consumption overhead.</description></item><item><title>FASE: An FPGA-Based Accelerator for Lightweight Sample Entropy With Monte Carlo Sampling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11115970</link><description>Sample entropy (SampEn) is an algorithm within information entropy that enables effective analysis of biological signals. Due to the need for extensive similarity matching operations, the SampEn calculation process is time-consuming. Although a series of fast SampEn algorithms have been proposed, they remain time-intensive when processing large data volumes. Additionally, previous field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based hardware accelerators designed for SampEn suffer from architectural design limitations, consuming substantial on-chip memory resources and operating at low frequencies. In this article, we propose FASE, an FPGA-based accelerator for lightweight sample entropy (LW-SampEn) with Monte Carlo (MC) sampling. The FASE design comprises two main parts: algorithm and hardware optimizations. On the algorithmic side, we introduce MC sampling into the merge-sort-based LW-SampEn algorithm, named MCLW-SampEn. MCLW-SampEn effectively reduces the computation load for large data volumes while maintaining algorithmic accuracy. For hardware, we first design efficient sorting and allocation modules to address boundary localization and load imbalance issues in previous accelerator designs. Then, we replicate the computation across the main phases to enable parallel processing. Finally, we deploy the design on the Pynq-Z2 board for validation. Experimental results show that the proposed MCLW-SampEn algorithm achieves an average speed up of  $3\times $  over the LW-SampEn algorithm, with accuracy losses kept within 0.5%. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) designs, FASE achieves an average speed up of  $12.8\times $  while reducing power consumption by 89.3%. Ablation studies indicate that, for the same algorithm, FASE offers a  $7.4\times $  speedup over related FPGA designs.</description></item><item><title>A 3-bit/Unit Time-Domain Compute-In-Memory Macro With Adjustable Unit Delay</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11074771</link><description>With the increasing demand for high-energy efficiency in multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations within deep learning accelerators, computing-in-memory (CIM) has gained significant attention. Time-domain (TD) CIM eliminates the need for analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), but single-bit delay units suffer from low computational efficiency. To address these issues, this work presents a TD multibit-per-unit CIM macro that leverages a precision-configurable time-to-digital converter (TDC) to enable accuracy configurability. Experimental results show that the proposed design achieves a 3-bit delay unit as a multibit CIM unit and an overall of 3-byte weight precision and 8-bit input precision. Compared to using three 1-bit/unit CIM delay units with an adder, it achieves a linearity with linear offset less than 3%. Besides, bias voltage adjusts the frequency and precision of the circuit (from 600 to 900 mV), enabling a minimum delay step of 0.11 ns. This system achieves a maximum energy efficiency of 268 TOPS/W under different VDD, making it a promising solution for always-on edge AI applications.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Integrated 4:1 DC&#8211;DC Converter With Series Transmission and Parallel Reception Through Electromagnetically Coupled Class-D LC Oscillators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002629</link><description>This article presents a fully integrated 4:1 dc-dc converter based on electromagnetically coupled Class-D LC (EMLC) oscillators. A series-transmission and parallel-reception (STPR) topology is proposed to achieve a scalable conversion ratio without significant efficiency degradation. Three power-transmitting oscillators (PTOs) and one merged power-receiving oscillator (PRO) are coupled at once via an on-chip quad-stacked transformer, resulting in a compact layout that reduces the required area and complexity. A prototype IC implemented in a 28-nm CMOS process achieves a high conversion ratio of 4:1 with a peak efficiency of 74.5% and supports input voltage up to 3.6 V. It achieves a peak power density of 0.78 W/mm2 while maintaining efficiency above 67% at peak power density. The converter also supports 1:4 step-up and 4:3 step-down conversions, delivering peak efficiencies of 74.3% and 90.3%, with peak power densities of 0.68 and 3.27 W/mm2, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Compact Low-Power 16 b SAR ADC Using Reservoir-Charge-Redistributed DAC and Configurable FIA-Based Comparator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045282</link><description>This article presents a reservoir-charge-redistributed (RCR) successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that facilitates a high linearity and compact area in low power. Conventional on-chip passive charge sharing (PCS) mitigates the bondwire influence on the off-chip reference voltage for the capacitive digital-to-analog converter (DAC) ( $C_{\text {DAC}}$ ). It, however, suffers from a considerable reservoir capacitor ( $C_{\text {REF}}$ ), poor linearity, and dynamic range (DR) loss. Unlike prior PCS schemes, the proposed RCR offers an individual  $C_{\text {REF}}$  to each bit trial, and each  $C_{\text {REF}}$  only performs charge redistribution once, which is enabled by the subranging architecture. These unique characteristics significantly decouple the compromise between linearity and DR loss and area. Furthermore, a configurable sequentially charged floating inverter amplifier (SC-FIA)-based comparator is also presented to improve energy efficiency further. Incorporated these techniques in a 16-bit SAR ADC, the prototype in 65-nm CMOS process achieves an 80.9-dB signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and 100.3-dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) at Nyquist input, consuming  $291.7~\mu $ W power from a single supply at 1 MS/s, and yielding a 32.1-fJ/conv.-step Walden figure of merit (FoMW) and 173.3-dB Schreier FoM (FoMS).</description></item><item><title>A 320-MHz NS TD-ADC-Assisted C/DT Hybrid Pipelined ADC With Single OTA Second-Order RAF</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11072697</link><description>This article presents a noise-shaping time-domain analog-to-digital converter (NS TD-ADC)-assisted continuous/discrete time (C/DT) hybrid pipelined ADC architecture in conjunction with a single operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) second-order residue amplifying filter (RAF), facilitating high power efficiency at wideband target. Besides, using a high-speed NS TD-ADC as the 1st-stage sub-quantizer (QTZ) effectively suppresses the tonal behavior due to the low-resolution residue. The RAF exploits the single-amplifier biquad (SAB)-based structure to realize a single OTA second-order filtering, thus simplifying the design and preserving high energy efficiency. The backend DT QTZ is with  $2{\times }$  time-interleaved (TI), which eases the compromise between speed and power efficiency in the CT pipelined (CT Pipe) ADC design. Fabricated in a 28-nm process, the design obtains 65.4-dB signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) with 320-MHz bandwidth while consuming 56.17 mW from 1.4- to 0.95-V power supplies. The prototype exhibits a dynamic range of 68 dB with a Schreier figure of merit (FoM) of 163 dB, demonstrating a high power efficiency under 2.4-GHz sampling frequency.</description></item><item><title>An LTPS-TFT-Based Large-Area PPG Readout Circuits With Improved Linearity and Robustness for Flexible Healthcare Ring</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11104841</link><description>Thin-film transistor (TFT) can be fabricated on flexible substrates, offering potential for seamless, long-term wearable health monitoring. However, the limited performance, process variation, and motion artifacts hinder the widespread adoption of flexible wearable devices. This article presents a TFT-based photoplethysmography (PPG) acquisition circuit for flexible healthcare rings, integrating a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) based analog front-end (AFE) to overcome the performance limitations caused by the low mobility of TFT devices. Meanwhile, a dead-zone free (DZ-Free) phase-frequency detector (PFD) was proposed and integrated into the VCO transimpedance amplifier (TIA) to enhance the linearity. Additionally, a 0-1 MASH VCO-analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) structure was adopted to improve the quantization dynamic range (DR). The system is implemented using  $\text {3-}$  $\mu $ m low-temperature poly-silicon (LTPS) TFT (LTPS-TFT) process of TIANMA Microelectronics. The measurement results show that DZ-Free PFD improves the linearity and the proposed VCO-TIA achieves a 61.5-dB DR. The proposed ADC demonstrates a 72-dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR), a 65.8-dB SNDR and an 80-dB DR. Under temperature sweeping from  ${-40}~{\mathrm {~^{\circ}C}}$  to  $80~{\mathrm {~^{\circ}C}}$  and supply voltage variations of  $10~{\pm }~2$  V, the ADC maintains performance variations within 3%, while the TIA stably sustains a gain of 110 dB $\Omega $ . Finally, PPG and blood oxygen saturation ( $\text {SpO}_{{2}}$ ) measurements were demonstrated, including ambient light compensation. This work provides a feasibility demonstration for TFT-based fully integrated flexible electronics in bio-signal monitoring applications.</description></item><item><title>A Wireless Battery-Free Cerebral-Oxygen-Monitoring Micro-System Featuring 0.21-mmHg Sensing Resolution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11039219</link><description>Cerebral oxygen reflects the oxidative metabolism in neurons, which can be monitored by detecting the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) in brain, to evaluate various brain diseases such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) as well as study the brain activities in response to transient oxygenation changes. To continuously detect the cerebral oxygen of freely moving subjects, cerebral oxygen monitoring (COM) devices are required to be wireless, high resolution, and long lifetime. In conventional wireless PO2 sensors, the optical devices present a short lifetime due to the power-hungry LED driver, whereas the existing electrochemical sensors suffer from both a bulky battery and a low resolution. In this work, we propose two techniques to address the issues in conventional PO2 sensors: 1) a sensing-current-reuse technique is proposed to cut down the power of current-detection circuit, which eliminates the power-hungry trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) and current-mirror amplifier in conventional potentiostats and 2) a bipolar residual zoom-in (BRZ) technique is proposed to improve the current-sensing resolution with low power dissipation. The proposed wireless COM chip is fabricated in a 55-nm CMOS process, which is integrated with a self-designed electrochemical PO2 sensor. The measured results show that an in vitro sensing resolution of 0.21 mmHg in oxygen value is achieved by the proposed BRZ technique. In addition, the 25- $\mu $ W low power enables 2-m range battery-free telemetry based on wireless power transfer (WPT) and backscatter communication.</description></item><item><title>A Rail-to-Rail Input NS-Pipelined-SAR ADC With Self-Boosted Input Impedance and Reused Residue Amplifier for Biosignal Acquisition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11098881</link><description>This article presents an energy-efficient 3rd-order noise-shaping (NS) pipelined-SAR ADC (NSP-ADC) with rail-to-rail input range and high input impedance over-the-bandwidth for biosignal acquisition. The two-stage pipelined-SAR architecture provides high resolution with low oversampling ratio (OSR) and inherent wide linear input range. In the proposed self-boosted input impedance technique, the previous sampled charge is exactly recovered without additional charging circuits, significantly improving the input impedance with high energy and hardware efficiency. Besides, to fit in the NS-pipelined-SAR architecture, the charge-sharing-based sampling noise cancellation (SNC) is presented. It boosts the input impedance further by reducing sampling capacitance and improves linear input range by nonlinearity cancellation. In addition, benefiting from the compact charge-sharing-based NS, the interstage residue amplifier (RA) of the pipelined-SAR ADC is reused by the SNC and NS circuits of both stages to further save power. Fabricated in 180-nm 1P6M standard CMOS, the proposed NSP-ADC shows an input impedance of &gt;150 M $\Omega $  over 1 kHz. With a low OSR of 10, it achieves the SNDR and SFDR of 87.3 and 95.2 dB, respectively, with a 1.96-Vpp differential input, while only consuming  $7~{\mu }$ W at a sampling rate of 20 kS/s.</description></item><item><title>A Compact D-Band Phase Shifter With 0.1-Degree Phase Resolution and Ultra-Low Phase Error in 65-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11039215</link><description>This article introduces a compact D-band phase shifter, which achieves high-resolution phase steps and ultra-low phase error, designed for the sixth-generation (6G) mobile network. The proposed design integrates two novel circuit architectures: a feedback fine-tuning phase shifter (FFPS) provides precise phase control with fine 0.1&#176; steps over a 22.5&#176; range by using a feedback transmission line (TL) to enhance gain and tuning range. The second architecture is a two-mode non-uniform propagation delay phase shifter (2-mode NU-PDPS), which enables coarse phase tuning with 22.5&#176; steps, covering a full 360&#176; phase range. It employs non-uniform MOSFET sizing to realize ideal TL operation. In addition, two modes are introduced in the quarter-wave TL to increase phase resolution without increasing area and thus achieves a core area of 0.06 $\text {mm}^{2}$ . The proposed phase shifter operates with 0.1&#176; steps over a 360&#176; fine-tuning range within the frequency range of 150&#8211;160 GHz. It achieves an rms phase error of 0.68&#176;, the lowest among reported phase shifters in this frequency range.

The proposed TX implemented in 65-nm CMOS achieves a high system efficiency of 25.1% at 0-dBm output with closed-loop modulation.

In the proposed time-modulated architecture, phase-shifted beam signals are sequentially fed into dedicated power amplifiers (PAs) at different time slots, contrasting with the conventional voltage-domain beam combination. Thus, the linearity and efficiency problems in conventional architecture are avoided, while maintaining comparable effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) performance. On the other hand, as each beam is transmitted in turn through different PAs, the phase compensation provided by phase shifters (PSs) deteriorates outside the main lobe region, providing the desired physical layer security. The proposed TX is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, where a canceling-based time modulator and a synchronous clock distribution network are implemented to support the time modulation. A measured 20.9-dBm saturation output power (Psat) and 9.37% power-added efficiency (PAE) at 6-dB power back off (PBO) from Psat are achieved. A two-beam, four-element TX system is implemented for over-the-air (OTA) measurements. The dual-beam measurement reveals the expected PAPR reduction, with an output power improvement of 1.1 dBm in 16-QAM for the 5% EVM and a 1.5-dBm improvement for 256-QAM at 4% EVM. Furthermore, the time-domain combination also suppresses the inter-beam power contention, resulting in constant performance regardless of the power of the other beam. When PA is saturated by beam 1 signal, the EVM of beam 2 is improved by 5.2%. The desired physical layer security is proved in single beam measurement, where the EVM of the eavesdropper increases from 4.8% to 18% at a 30&#176; angle.</description></item><item><title>A 14-to-32-Gb/s Deadzone-Free Referenceless CDR With Autocovariance-Based Seamless Frequency Detector in 40-nm CMOS Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029275</link><description>This article proposes a deadzone-free clock and data recovery (CDR) without an external reference clock. To extract a frequency difference, the proposed referenceless CDR adopts a stochastic frequency detector, which utilizes consecutive data and edge samples. Although the probability-based frequency detection (FD) technique is promising, a deadzone should be carefully considered to prevent false locking. Therefore, by analyzing the stochastic FD thoroughly, this work proposes an autocovariance-based stochastic FD (ASFD) to resolve the deadzone issue and provide a more robust CDR operation. Since the autocovariance function is easily implemented in the digital domain, the proposed digital CDR with the ASFD improves the frequency tracking ability with minimal hardware overhead. Fabricated in 40-nm CMOS technology, the prototype CDR occupies an active area of 0.032 mm2. The CDR achieves a seamless frequency locking with a capture range from 14 to 32 Gb/s and frequency acquisition time within  $7~{\mu }$ s. At 32 Gb/s, the CDR achieves a bit error rate (BER) of less than  $10{^{-12}}$  and an energy efficiency of 1.15 pJ/b at a supply voltage of 1.0 V.</description></item><item><title>A Monolithically Integrated DWDM Si-Photonics Transceiver for Chiplet Optical I/O</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11080352</link><description>A monolithically integrated dense wavelength-division multiplexing (DWDM) silicon photonics (SiPh) transceiver is presented.

However, fine-tuning RRAM-based SoCs remains challenging due to the inherent limitations of non-volatile memory (NVM) characteristics. This work proposes an NVM-endurance/latency-aware collaborative RRAM/static random access memory (SRAM) compute-in-memory (CIM) accelerator that addresses the difficulties associated with RRAM write operations during fine-tuning tasks for both CNN and transformer models. The major contributions are: 1) RRAM-most significant bit (MSB)&#8211;SRAM-least significant bit (LSB) (RMSL)-based collaborative CIM macros, mitigating RRAM cell flipping times and alleviating the endurance concern; 2) an RRAM-sparse-SRAM-dense (RSSD) weight updating engine, minimizing the long reading and writing latency associated with RRAM access; and 3) a row-wise pipeline weight gradient (WG) computing data flow with low-hardware overhead. With a maximum bit update of ten times per fine-tuning (20 epochs, from start to convergence), the system achieves an energy efficiency of 76.25 TOPS/W for the CIM macro and 22.07 TOPS/W for the overall system. Thanks to the bit-level collaborative CIM, the RRAM CIM macro achieves the same hardware utilization during fine-tuning and inference processes to support RRAM&#8217;s energy-efficient computing. The proposed CIM accelerator, fabricated using 28-nm CMOS technology, achieves up to  $143{\times }$  RRAM endurance improvement,  $117{\times }$  and  $144{\times }$  reduction in RRAM write power and latency.</description></item><item><title>A 28 nm 128-kb Exponent- and Mantissa-Computation-In-Memory Dual-Macro for Floating-Point and INT CNNs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966029</link><description>Floating-point computing-in-memory (FP-CIM) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the energy efficiency of cloud and edge artificial intelligence (AI) devices.

Previous 3-D PNN processors solely focused on the acceleration of algorithm structure [e.g., nearest neighbor searching, shared multi-layer perceptron (MLP), etc.] required due to the unordered and unstructured characteristics of point-cloud with the assumption that the entire point-cloud data are stored in external memory. However, they were impractical for real-time PNN in outdoor environments with LiDAR, because the LiDAR takes ~100 ms of sensing latency to obtain the 360&#176; fully scanned LiDAR points, causing a waste of system latency and additional delays due to external memory accesses. Moreover, their Cartesian-based bin partitioning method exacerbates workload imbalance in outdoor applications due to spatial sparsity as the point distribution becomes increasingly sparse with distance from the sensor, causing severe performance degradation. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient 3-D PNN processor with LiDAR&#8211;PNN processor pipelined structure that eliminates the external memory between LiDAR and processor and hides sensing latency behind processing time by utilizing the mechanical characteristic of LiDAR with the following hardware features: 1) cylindrical partitioning core with novel cylindrical bin partitioning method as well as halo indexing to process with the partially scanned ( $2{\theta }$ ) data and mitigate the PNN accuracy loss; 2) pseudo-random number generator-based sampling unit and k-nearest neighbor searching cores with unified neighbor searching algorithm to reduce the computation cost; and 3) linked-list memory management unit and predicted memory allocator to efficiently manage the point-cloud and support the parallel processing of neighbor searching and shared MLP. As a result, the proposed PNN processor achieves 2.18 M point/s of peak performance and  $0.40~{\mu }$ J/point of energy with 108 K points.</description></item><item><title>A High-Resolution Solid-State LiDAR Sensor With Reconfigurable Histogramming Time-to-Digital Converter and Filter for Depth Refinement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021650</link><description>An area-efficient, high-resolution CMOS light detection and ranging (LiDAR) capable of generating  $400 \times 112$  depth images is proposed. This sensor employs a rolling-scan architecture that is compatible with a row-addressable solid-state LiDAR system. To achieve high resolution, a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) analog front-end (AFE) circuit was implemented using only five nMOS transistors. A reconfigurable-resolution (RR) hTDC, capable of converting one-/two-channel signals with variable time resolutions of 1, 2, or 4 ns, is further proposed to implement a 400-channel histogramming time-to-digital converter (hTDC) with low memory overhead. The sensor leverages RR-hTDC to support two image resolution modes: macro and quadruple resolution (QR). In the macro mode,  $200 \times 56$  depth images can be acquired with a 1-ns time resolution. In the QR mode, the sensor can achieve  $400 \times 112$  high-resolution depth images with a 2-ns time resolution. In the range-enhanced (RE) mode, the time resolution is halved for distances beyond 100 m, enabling the detection range to be extended up to 200 m. A laser profile-based depth refining (DR) filter was used to compensate for the reduction in time resolution and ensure sub-centimeter time resolution, improving depth precision by 40% compared with the conventional QR mode. The prototype LiDAR sensor was fabricated as a 90-nm CMOS image sensor (CIS) process. In outdoor conditions under 135-klx sunlight, the worst case depth precision and accuracy for distances of 15&#8211;60 m were measured as 10 and 17 cm, respectively. Moreover, a relative precision of less than 0.18% was achieved over a 60&#8211;130-m range under 90-klx sunlight. The total power consumption of the sensor was measured to be 572 mW when operating at 20 frames/s under 70-klx sunlight.</description></item><item><title>A 50-MHz Pulse-Width Modulator Embodying Low-Loss Quasi-Dynamic Comparators for Very High-Frequency DC&#8211;DC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988788</link><description>In the next-generation Internet of Things (NG-IoT) applications with sub-50-mA loads, the state-of-the-art very high switching frequencies (VHFs, e.g., 50 MHz) dc-dc converters are typically power-inefficient at light loads, e.g., 60%. This is largely due to the high power losses of high-speed static comparators employed in the pulse-width modulator of the VHF converter, e.g., ~40% of the overall power losses. Dynamic comparators may mitigate the high loss, but they are impractical to pulse-width-modulation-based converters due to the high-speed clock generator requirement. To mitigate the power losses, we present a pulse-width-modulator converter embodying a proposed quasi-dynamic (QD) comparator (and its hysteretic variant). The innovation is the first-ever comparator that features a clock-free regenerative latch (CFRL), thereby enabling the comparator to simultaneously feature the high-speed and low-loss advantages of dynamic comparators, yet clockless operation of static comparators. Our 50-MHz pulse-modulator converter, realized in 65-nm CMOS and embodying the proposed QD comparators, features a high ~82% power efficiency at 10 mA (20% of max load)&#8212; ${\ge }20$ % higher power efficiency than the state-of-the-art VHF converters. The proposed QD comparator therein dissipates ~145- $\mu $ W power and features 2.9-ns propagation delay&#8212; ${\ge }40$ % lesser power-delay product than the state-of-the-art static comparators. The proposed QD comparator can be advantageously applied to replace static comparators in a myriad of applications, potentially improving their power efficiency without compromising high-speed operation.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic Voltage-, Frequency-, and Resolution-Scalable (DVFRS) 8&#8211;10 b 12.5-to-734 MS/s Non-Interleaved SAR ADC With 0.8-to-5.9 fJ/conv-Step in 22-nm FDSOI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10936988</link><description>High-efficiency analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) are designed to operate over narrow supply, resolution, and frequency ranges.

The proposed ADC uses a fully dynamic flexible successive-approximation register (SAR) architecture with a wide range of supply adaptation to acclimate across a wide range of sampling rates. Furthermore, it also incorporates resolution-scalable DAC, comparator, and SAR logic to attain efficient conversion at multiple resolutions. A prototype is fabricated in 22-nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI) technology, with the dynamic voltage-, frequency-, and resolution-scalable (DVFRS) ADC core occupying an active area of  $40\times 70~{\mu }$  m.

The inter-stage gain and digital-to-analog converter (DAC) mismatch are calibrated by leveraging the proposed auxiliary-latch-based comparison-threshold dithering (CTD) and separate-averaging algorithm. This calibration achieves fast convergence, requiring only 4096 dither-injected samples for background gain-error correction. Fabricated in a 22-nm CMOS process, the ADC consumes 9.93 mW at 475 MS/s and achieves a peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 71.5 dB, yielding a Schreier figure of merit (FoMS) of 175.3 dB and a Walden figure of merit (FoMW) of 6.8 fJ/conversion-step.</description></item><item><title>dAJC: A 2.02-mW 50-Mb/s Direct Analog to MJPEG Converter for Video Sensor Nodes Using Switched Capacitor MAC-Quantizer With Process Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11090156</link><description>With the advancement in the field of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Bodies (IoB), video camera applications utilizing video sensor nodes (VSNs) have become increasingly significant. These applications are pivotal in areas such as autonomous driving, health monitoring, machine vision, and security. Notable examples include their use in uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), body-worn cameras, and surveillance systems. However, these applications often face challenges related to power consumption, primarily due to the large data volumes generated by analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) during the transmission of digitized high-resolution video signals. This data deluge introduces additional processing and storage overheads, exacerbating the problem of resource-constrained sensor nodes having limited battery capacity. To address this challenge, we propose a low-power solution that performs video compression directly at the sensor while shifting computation from the digital domain to the energy-efficient analog domain (suitable for peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values below 40&#8211;50 dB). Unlike conventional architectures, which rely on digital signal processing (DSP) blocks for computation and compression after the ADC stage, our approach eliminates the need for these power-intensive digital blocks at the sensor. Instead, we employ a switched capacitor (SC)-based computation unit operating in the analog domain, significantly reducing overall power consumption. Additionally, we utilize a dynamically activated ADC that activates only for significant samples, which constitute a small fraction ( ${\le }5$ %) of the total captured analog video samples. This approach enables us to achieve approximately  ${\sim } 20{\times }$  lower analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion energy. By combining analog computation with the dynamically activated ADC, our proposed solution achieves at least  ${\gt } 2{\times }$  reduction in power consumption compared to a digital implementation, with only a ~5-dB degradation in PSNR&#8212;an imperceptible difference to the human eye. We also propose a calibration scheme to mitigate the impact of variations introduced by analog computation, thereby enhancing the PSNR of the decoded video or image.</description></item><item><title>RAC-NAF: A Reconfigurable Analog Circuitry for Nonlinear Activation Function Computation in Computing-in-Memory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988857</link><description>The emerging computing-in-memory (CIM) architecture shows promise in efficiently processing deep neural networks (DNNs) by minimizing the data movement through analog in-memory computing. Unfortunately, the energy efficiency of CIM is still limited since it struggles to efficiently process the massive nonlinear activation functions (AFs) widely used in DNNs. In the current solutions, AFs require to be fulfilled in the digital domain with co-processors or lookup table (LUT). Therefore, a significant amount of data requires a round-trip conversion between the analog and digital domains at each AF process. The unavoidable analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog (AD/DA) conversions dominate the system&#8217;s power consumption and reduce the overall energy efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a reconfigurable analog circuitry for nonlinear AF computation, named RAC-NAF. It is a pure analog circuitry that utilizes Taylor approximation (TA) to fit the arbitrary AFs, thereby reducing AD/DA conversions. To enhance the accuracy, RAC-NAF adopts a segmentation calculation method (SCM) based on the characteristics of nonlinear AFs. Moreover, the RAC-NAF provides the capability for reconfiguration to support various AFs and can be easily integrated with the existing CIM accelerators. The experimental results show that the proposed RAC-NAF significantly improves the performance of the CIM accelerators and reduces the energy consumption. When performing inference on various CIM accelerators, the energy consumption of AD/DA conversions can be reduced up to  $12.31{\times }$ , while the overall energy efficiency can be increased by  $2.34{\times }$ &#8211; $5.20{\times }$ , and the accuracy loss is below 1%.</description></item><item><title>A 65-nm Digital Stochastic Compute-in-Memory CNN Processor With 8-bit Precision</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10949867</link><description>Compute-in-memory (CIM) is an emerging solution that embeds compute logic inside the memory array to achieve high energy efficiency and reduce memory access cost. However, current CIM solutions require bulky analog-to-digital converter (ADC)/digital-to-analog converters (DACs) that make the accelerator power hungry and unable to scale in the more advanced process with a low power supply. Stochastic computing (SC) is an attractive alternative digital compute scheme that uses tiny bit-serial logic, e.g., AND and OR, to perform the basic MAC operations on stochastic sequences. In this work, we propose a stochastic CIM (SCIM) approach that combines the benefits of SC and CIM accelerators. It eliminates the DACs/ADCs in CIM and adds CIM&#8217;s benefits to SC. We demonstrate a highly programmable convolutional neural network (CNN) accelerator that achieves up to 7.96-TOPS/W peak energy efficiency in 65 nm and inference accuracy comparable to 8-b fixed point.</description></item><item><title>A High-Accuracy and Ultra-Energy-Efficient Cardiac Arrhythmia Classification Processor for Wearable Intelligent ECG Monitoring</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10967238</link><description>Wearable intelligent electrocardiography (ECG) sensors with integrated cardiac arrhythmia classification processors have been used to detect and classify arrhythmia, alerting users to potential cardiac diseases. While state-of-the-art arrhythmia classification processors employ neural networks (NNs), the high computational complexity of NNs results in significant energy consumption, limiting the model size and classification performance of NNs. Additionally, inter-patient variation in ECG can lead to accuracy degradation when applying a trained NN to patients whose ECG features differ from those in the training dataset. In this work, we propose an ultra-energy-efficient cardiac arrhythmia classification processor incorporating three key technologies: 1) heartbeat difference-based classification to improve accuracy under inter-patient variation and reduce energy consumption; 2) event-driven NN computation with shared feature extraction to reduce energy consumption; and 3) an adaptive NN wake-up technique to reduce energy consumption while maintaining accuracy. The design was fabricated using 55-nm CMOS process technology and evaluated using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia dataset. For arrhythmia classification, it demonstrates an energy consumption of  $0.09~{\mu }$ J per classification with 98.7%/96.6% accuracy for intra-patient and inter-patient testing, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 28-nm 239-bp/&#956;J Agile Pangenome Analysis Accelerator for Multi-Scheme Read Mapping</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955400</link><description>Recent advancements in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequencing have brought about a significant paradigm shift in genome analysis, moving from linear approaches to pangenome graphs. Pangenome analysis demands powerful computation capabilities to handle graph data structures, which are irregular and complex, as well as the flexibility to adapt to various algorithms and data types.

To enhance performance without compromising accuracy, we introduce a neural architecture search (NAS) method to develop layer-wise mixed-precision and mixed-sparsity DNNs. However, the optimization cannot be directly applied to existing DNN accelerators due to the specific data requirements of layer-wise mixed precision and mixed sparsity. To address this issue, this research proposes separate mixed-precision and mixed-sparsity accelerators. Both accelerators demonstrate cutting-edge results. The mixed-precision accelerator utilizes a split-and-combination vector (SCV) to re-use variable precision units (1/2/4/8 bit) at each layer with a further vector systolic array (VSA) implementation. By optimizing NAS for mixed-precision VGG-16, the VSA achieves mixed energy efficiency reached 29.12 TOPS/W, which is equivalent to 2 bit and equivalent accuracy at 4 bit. The mixed-sparsity accelerator introduces a log-scale structured sparse encoding strategy, combined with MAC and group VSA (G-VSA) optimization, to enhance system performance. It achieves an average energy efficiency of up to 21.7 TOPS/W at 0.7 V and 400 MHz using 28-nm CMOS. The measured results show that the mixed-precision chip exhibits better energy efficiency and accuracy than the mixed-sparsity chip.</description></item><item><title>C-Transformer: An Energy-Efficient Homogeneous DNN-Transformer/SNN-Transformer Processor for Large Language Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964134</link><description>In this article, we propose a new language model processor named the C-Transformer to address the external memory bottleneck of language models.

Based on a simplified large-signal transistor model, we study the frequency-doubling mechanism of THz PPFDs and reveal that the input second harmonic, tuned by the common-mode (CM) source impedance, makes a profound impact on circuit performances, especially the bandwidth. Hence, to enable broadband THz PPFDs, we develop a source-tuning-based design scheme. In the scheme, a mode-decoupling harmonic source/load-pull strategy is used to identify the broadband optimal CM source and second harmonic load impedances, and a slotline-based second harmonic source-tuning technique then helps to realize the source impedance and simultaneously implements the broadband input matching. As a proof-of-concept, the proposed design scheme is applied in a full H-band amplifier-doubler chain in 0.13- $\mu $ m SiGe BiCMOS.

The proposed current-reused coupled oscillator with order of 2, where the noise circulation oscillator is stacked on top of PMOS cross-coupled oscillator solves the strict trade-off between power consumption and phase noise. The degeneration transistors for noise circulating operations are biased in triode-region instead of in saturation to provide an optimum delay in loop gain, such that the positive and negative phase change in the normalized impulse sensitivity function (ISF) become more symmetric. Thus, the  $1/f^{3}$  phase noise is significantly improved.

This paper proposes a high-speed energy-efficient integrated AFC with asynchronous hybrid searching technique. The asynchronous architecture breaks the minimum limit of search time, while the hybrid method overcomes nonmonotonic variation of frequency errors in binary search. A true single-phase clock (TSPC)-based RF digital counter further accelerates AFC by directly quantizing the VCO output frequency.

To this end, this paper proposes the use of a pulsed (chopped) voltage stimulator, implemented using a low-complexity switch network with fully adaptive real-time control. The fully-integrated control architecture guarantees current waveform reconstruction and charge balancing by continuously monitoring the charge delivered to the electrode, thus offering robustness towards power-supply voltage and electrode impedance variations. The architecture has a high energy efficiency across the entire output operating range. The output waveform is generated in charge samples (slices) of controlled amount; by controlling these slices properly, the desired arbitrary stimulation waveform is constructed. A voltage monitoring circuit is used to apply active charge balancing; the duration of the balancing phase is adjusted by varying the number of charge samples. The feasibility of the architecture is demonstrated with a chip prototype manufactured in a 180&#8198;nm, 1.8&#8198;V/5&#8198;V CMOS process, and has an area of only 0.027&#8198;mm2 per non-multiplexed stimulator channel. Across the entire output operating range, the experimental validation of the prototype demonstrates a source energy efficiency that is up to  $35\,\%$  better than previously published implementations.

Processing time series data by spiking neural networks can further reduce the power consumption of neuromorphic computing devices because most of the energy in the network is consumed only when the neuron generates and transmits a spike. In this study, we designed fully analog two-variable spiking neuron and spiking neural network circuits, taking advantage of the physical properties of transistors as analog devices. The energy consumption of the circuit for generating a spike was 22.7 fJ/spike when the MOS transistors were operating in the subthreshold region. The proposed circuits were implemented on an analog very large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuit chip in a  $0.18~\mu $ m CMOS process.

The primary components of the image sensor system include a  $16\times 8$  SPADs array fabricated using 130nm CMOS technology, along with 128 passive quenching circuits and 128 pulse shaping circuits within the pixels, a digital signal processing (DSP) circuit implemented on the FPGA, and a laser driving circuit with adjustable pulse width. The laser pulse width can be adaptively modified according to the bin size of the partial histogram, thereby improving the signal-to-background light ratio (SBR) and reducing measurement jitter. The DSP incorporates a hybrid partial histogram (HPH) algorithm based on both direct time-of-flight (DToF) and indirect time-of-flight (IToF), along with a non-linear spatiotemporal coincidence detection (NSCD) circuit. The proposed HPH algorithm significantly reduces the storage resource requirements for histograms, eliminating the need for in-pixel time-to-digital converter (TDC). Each pixel&#8217;s histogram requires only 180 bits of storage resource. Moreover, the IToF algorithm effectively enhances the system&#8217;s measurement precision.

Efficient hardware utilization hinges on effective number representation. Integer representation, a widely adopted method, uses scaling factors and offsets to enhance network accuracy and simplify fractional bit selection through uniform quantization. On the other hand, non-uniform quantization is well-suited for DNNs with parameters following a normal distribution, helping reduce data width requirements. This paper introduces a novel non-uniform representation called MLB (Multi-Level Binary), which encompasses and extends integer representation. We propose an architecture that objectively compares these representations, demonstrating that MLB is a superset of integer representation in terms of accuracy. Our comprehensive analysis spans various data widths, parallel factorization, and DNN models. Our findings indicate that MLB outperforms integer representation in energy efficiency for lower bit widths (2&#8211;5 bits), whereas integer representation is more advantageous for higher bit widths (4&#8211;8 bits). Specifically, our work shows an average energy improvement of 1.1 to  $2.3\times $  and area saving up to  $1.7\times $  compared to integer multiply-accumulate (MAC) units, while preserving network accuracy.

These scenarios require operation in extreme temperature environments, with cross-temperature read/write occurring frequently. However, cross-temperature affects programming reliability, leading to high raw bit error rates (RBER), which degrades read performance and increases energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a novel temperature-aware differential programming (TADP) scheme to optimize read performance and energy consumption under cross-temperature read/write. Specifically, first, a temperature-aware compensatory programming scheme is proposed to reduce the cross-temperature-induced degradation of RBER. Second, a layer variation-aware compensatory programming scheme is proposed to reduce the compensatory programming latency. Finally, a degraded programming scheme is proposed to enhance the temperature toughness of poorly temperature-tough word-lines by using them as MLC. Evaluated on 233-layer 3D triple-level-cell (TLC) NAND flash, TADP achieved encouraging optimizations in programming reliability, energy consumption, and read performance with minimal capacity loss.</description></item><item><title>FlexDCIM: A 400 MHz 249.1 TOPS/W 64 Kb Flexible Digital Compute-in-Memory SRAM Macro for CNN Acceleration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916950</link><description>This work proposes a 64Kb fully reconfigurable SRAM compute-in-memory (CIM) macro for convolutional neural network (CNN) acceleration using a 65nm node.

To address this need, we conduct a design space exploration and comparative evaluation of four prominent technologies&#8212;8T SRAM, ferroelectric transistors (FeFETs), resistive RAM (ReRAM), and spin-orbit torque magnetic RAM (SOT-MRAM) &#8211; at the 7nm node. We focus on the computational robustness in crossbar arrays and the influence of the technologies on DNN inference accuracy. We conduct IMC-driven optimization of each technology, accounting for both device- and circuit-level non-idealities. Using a cross-layer simulation framework that integrates physical models of synaptic devices and interconnects, we compare the inference accuracy of these technologies. Further, we throw light on the unique device attributes and device-circuit interactions that impact the DNN accuracy. Following this, we analyze the response of each technology to array size, bit-slice, and dataset/network complexity and how such design knob impact DNN accuracy. Our results for ResNet-20 with CIFAR-10 show that optimized FeFETs, due to their compact bit-cell layout and high distinguishability, lead to the highest accuracy, especially for large arrays. For more complex datasets (such as ResNet-50 with CIFAR-100) and larger bit-slices, ReRAM achieves performance comparable to that of FeFET. Lastly, we evaluate Partial Wordline Activation (PWA) and propose custom ADC reference levels as non-ideality-mitigating solutions and compare the response of each technology to these techniques.</description></item><item><title>Toward Efficient Eye Tracking in AR/VR Devices: A Near-Eye DVS-Based Processor for Real-Time Gaze Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947097</link><description>This paper presents an efficient near-eye dynamic vision sensor (DVS)-based processor for real-time eye tracking in augmented reality/virtual reality (AR/VR) devices. The processor takes advantage of the sparse event data with fine time resolution from the DVS, addressing the need for high frame-rate, low-power, and accurate eye tracking on wearable devices with extended battery life. Exploiting the inherent sparsity of event data, we propose an event-density-based region of interest (ROI) determination method that operates directly on event stream, which requires  $47\times $  fewer operations than the traditional methods, effectively overcoming the latency problem caused by the heavy computational loads. To eliminate the issue of decreasing accuracy at the edges of the field of view (FoV), we customized and fine-tuned a neural network for gaze estimation, ensuring uniformly distributed sub-degree accuracy. An estimator with a streamlined output mapping strategy and an adaptive window-sliding convolution scheme is implemented for gaze estimation acceleration. The processor is designed and fabricated in UMC 40-nm LP technology with a core area of 2.52 mm2 and performs end-to-end eye tracking exclusively with the raw event stream from DVS, achieving an average accuracy of 0.91&#176; within a  $96^{\circ } \times 64^{\circ }$  FoV. Operating at 200 MHz, it achieves a dynamic frame rate of up to 1.2 kHz and requires only  $12.7~\mu $ J of energy per gaze estimation. By integrating the DVS, the processor enables real-time, low-power, and accurate eye tracking, enhancing the immersive experience on AR/VR devices and offering intuitive and seamless interactions.</description></item><item><title>Single-Reference-Based Multi-Level Cell Sensing Scheme for Spin-Orbit Torque MRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955725</link><description>Spin-orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) is a strong candidate to replace static RAM and dynamic RAM due to its high speed, near-zero standby power, and high density. Moreover, employing multi-level cell (MLC) techniques can further increase storage density. However, there are several challenges when sensing MLC: 1) The sensing margin is too small. 2) Three references and several different sensing are required to distinguish four states. As a result, significant read yield degradation, area overhead, and performance penalty are unavoidable. There are two conceptual methods for sensing MLC. The one-step parallel sensing scheme (SS) allows for data reading at once, but suffers from low read yield due to the offset of sensing circuit. On the other hand, the two-step SS using offset-cancellation technique can achieve a higher read yield but requires twice the time. To address these challenges, the single-reference-based MLC-SS using offset-cancellation technique is proposed. HSPICE simulation results, based on industry-compatible 28 nm model parameters demonstrate that the proposed MLC-SS can achieve a comparable read yield of 94.19% compared to 86.17% for the one-step parallel SS and 96.77% for the two-step SS, while requiring only one reference and incurring just a 20% increase in sensing time.</description></item><item><title>Domain-Specific Hyperdimensional RISC-V Processor for Edge-AI Training</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10931124</link><description>Edge AI has become the cornerstone of many applications. Yet, progress is limited by the large complexity of training a deep neural network (a DNN). hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is positioned as an alternative approach for Edge AI that is compact enough to enable training. The main challenge for an HDC model is to maintain its key features while balancing high inference accuracy with efficiency. A simple binary HDC model lacks accuracy, while the computational complexity of a floating-point model is too high. This work presents FixedHD, a novel 16-bit fixed-point HDC model enabling training at the Edge. FixedHD achieves an accuracy similar to floating-point model while lowering computational complexity. The model is supported by a customized RISC-V processor tailored to speedup both training and inference. The processor is extended with advanced HDC-specific instructions, a vector unit to utilize HDC&#8217;s parallel nature, and, for the first time, approximate computing to exploit its robustness. Further, memory requirements are reduced by quantizing mathematical functions and reducing the large HDC encoding matrix by up to 390 x. Compared to the baseline processor, inference and training are accelerated on average by 6.9 x and 3 x, respectively. The energy consumption is reduced by 4.6 x and 1.9 x at the cost of an increase in area by 45 %. The inference accuracy remains at the high level of floating-point models despite the heavy quantization and approximation.</description></item><item><title>An Ultra-Low-Power Flip-Flop With Near-Threshold Robust Operation and Redundant-Free Internal Clock Transitions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10937042</link><description>Optimizing the power consumption of flip-flops (FFs), as basic building blocks of sequential digital circuits, can substantially reduce the power of the whole system. This work proposes a new Robust Redundant-Free Flip-Flop (RRFF) for ultra-low-power purposes that addresses both aspects that have the potential to reduce power consumption: it has static and contention-free characteristics that provide the robustness required for supply voltage scalability down to the near-threshold region and, at the same time, it eliminates all internal redundant transitions, so that the circuit exclusively consumes dynamic energy when data changes. Measurement results from a test chip fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology show that the RRFF achieves 63.4% clock power reduction across a wide voltage range (0.4-1.1 V) and 15.0% power reduction at 100% activity for the same supply voltage range with minimal area overhead compared to the conventional transmission gate flip-flop (TGFF).</description></item><item><title>SKI-SAT: A CMOS-Compatible Hardware for Solving SAT Problems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945719</link><description>Nature-inspired computation is receiving increasing attention. Various Ising machine (IM) implementations have recently been proven to be effective in solving numerous combinatorial optimization problems including maximum cut, low density parity check (LDPC) decoding, and Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. In this paper, a novel method is presented to solve SAT or MAX-SAT problems with a CMOS circuit implementation.

This phenomenon is particularly significant in circuits with distorted current waveforms, often found in systems with non-linear loads. The increase in resistance leads to higher power losses within the contact system and the entire current path, contributing to excessive heating. As a result, the operational reliability and lifespan of the connector can be significantly reduced. To address this issue, this study determines a correction factor that allows for proper adjustment of the rated current in the mechanical connectors used in such conditions, ensuring improved performance and durability in practical applications.</description></item><item><title>A High-Performance Memristive Circuit Design for DCGAN in Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947361</link><description>Edge computing devices based on the von Neumann architecture can&#8217;t fulfill the demand for computational resources in Generative Adversarial Networks.

The primary side of the converter consists of two series-connected forward converter units, and the secondary side incorporates a resonant tank in the semiactive variable-structure rectifier (SA-VSR), which adjusts the voltage gain range through fixed-frequency PWM control. By controlling the duty cycle of the bidirectional switch in SA-VSR, the proposed converter can operate in three modes: voltage doubling rectification (VDR) mode, full bridge rectification (FBR) mode, and PWM control mode, which can achieve a regulation of twice the voltage gain range. This paper provides a detailed working principle and voltage gain analysis of the converter. All switches of the proposed converter can achieve ZVS, and there is no issue of direct short-circuiting through the switches, making it highly reliable and appropriate for applications in aerospace.

To ensure proper power supply acquisition under positive input conditions and isolation under negative input conditions, a negative input isolation circuit is first used for the non-power circuit. Then, two protective NMOS transistors are used to pull the gate and substrate of the power NMOS transistor to the negative VIN to prevent leakage current in the power NMOS transistor. At the same time, two simple switches which conduct under positive VIN and cutoff under negative VIN are used to effectively turn off the two protective NMOS transistors, preventing them from affecting the normal multi-mode operation of the power switch during positive VIN. This circuit does not require an additional positive voltage power supply and does not introduce voltage drop, providing negative protection for all devices and circuits between VIN and GND as well as between VIN and VOUT. The proposed power switch is implemented using a 180 nm BCD process, and the test results show that the power switch can effectively mitigate &#8722;5 V negative voltage at the input power supply.</description></item><item><title>An Inductor-First Tri-Path Hybrid Buck Converter With Reduced Inductor Current Suitable for USB Power Delivery Adapter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10935648</link><description>This paper presents an inductor-first tri-path (IFTP) buck converter suitable for USB power delivery adapter to charge 1-2 cell battery. The proposed topology adopts the inductor-first strategy and the tri-path strategy of one inductor path and two capacitor paths to extend the output voltage conversion range, realize the continuous input current, eliminate the input EMI noise, and reduce the inductor current. In addition, a phase-interleaved symmetric inductor-first tri-path (PIS-IFTP) buck converter is proposed to alleviate the inrush current in the flying capacitor under extreme duty cycle of IFTP converter, while further reducing inductor current ripple.

Effective management of DC MG clusters requires a control system designed for rapid response to fluctuating renewable source behavior and load demands. Traditional control methods lack the ability to pre-specify desired system performance, including convergence time and transient/steady-state behavior. Therefore, this work explores a prescribed performance function-based predefined time (PPF-PDT) control for optimizing the power dispatch of interconnected DC MGs according to the user-assigned preplanned desired performance. This scheme comprises secondary and tertiary control layers to handle the optimal operation for individual MGs and interconnected MGs, respectively, using a dual-layer sparse cyber network. In each MG, the secondary control matches the incremental costs of all distributed generation units while stabilizing the MG&#8217;s average voltage to the assigned voltage level within an adjustable predefined settling time independent of initial states. Adopting PPF significantly enhances transient and steady-state behavior, ensuring the tracking errors remain within desired performance limits. Additionally, distributed tertiary controllers across multiple MGs adjust their voltage references to optimize the exchanged power among them within a user-assigned tunable settling time. A thorough Lyapunov analysis verifies the stability of the proposed control algorithm within the predefined time and confines the tracking errors within acceptable bounds. Extensive simulation and experimental studies confirm the feasibility of the control strategy under various conditions.</description></item><item><title>A 3.4-GS/s 12-Bit Time-Interleaved Pipelined SAR ADC With Non-Foster Ring Amplifier-Based High-Linearity Track-and-Hold Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11111691</link><description>This brief presents a 3.4-GS/s 12-bit time-interleaved pipelined SAR ADC fabricated in 28-nm CMOS, incorporating a high-linearity track-and-hold amplifier (THA) based on the proposed non-Foster ring amplifier (NFRA).

The gated-ring oscillator (GRO) TDC is usually used in the pixel, but it suffers from timing error in the stabilization time and high power consumption. A three-segment TDC with a half-cycle single-stage Vernier ring is presented in this brief. The ring delay line has no stabilization time. The time resolution of Vernier-ring TDC is not directly related to the oscillation frequency, thus enabling lower power consumption. There is only one stage delay unit in this ring delay line, and its compact area makes it suitable for pixels. A half-cycle Vernier judgment circuit is proposed, which shortens the operating time of the Vernier TDC and reduces its power consumption. An  $8\times 8$  SPAD readout integrated circuit (ROIC) was fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS technology.

To address this challenge, this work proposes a timestep-parallel 4D neuromorphic computing array of size  $N_{T}\times N_{Z}\times N_{X}\times N_{Y}$ , simultaneously enabling parallel computing in temporal and spatial dimensions. The  $N_{T}$  dimension supports timestep-parallel computing, the  $N_{Z}$  dimension supports neuron-parallel computing, and the  $N_{X}$  and  $N_{Y}$  dimensions are used for synapse-parallel computing. The architecture facilitates flexible data reuse across different dimensions (with weights reuse along different timesteps and spikes reuse along different neurons), significantly reducing storage access. Meanwhile, it treats the membrane potential as a short-term computational variable that can be stored in a small buffer, thereby eliminating large-scale membrane potential storage overhead and access. The reduction in data access and storage costs is beneficial for lowering system power consumption and enhancing synaptic energy efficiency. Ultimately, the architecture is evaluated using a 28 nm process library and demonstrates a high computing power density of 1160 GSOP/s/mm2 and a high synaptic energy efficiency of 0.36 pJ/SOP, surpassing related state-of-the-art works. This work significantly reduces the hardware cost of neuromorphic computing and is expected to enhance the competitiveness of neuromorphic hardware in contemporary artificial intelligence applications.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced Small-Signal Model for Charge-Controlled LLC Resonant Converters Using Time-Domain Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11115087</link><description>The conventional models employ fundamental harmonic approximation for charge-controlled LLC resonant converter.

However, the transient response of the traditional digital low-dropout regulators (DLDOs) is limited by the closed-loop response, which makes it difficult to meet the speed requirements of the PWM power output. This brief presents a State-Switching DLDO (SS-DLDO), specially optimized for PWM thermo-optic tuning. Two state selectors, controlled by a PWM signal, are inserted into the SS-DLDO structure to control the connections and operational states of the DLDO asynchronously. This enables the speed of PWM tuning to be decoupled from the feedback loop of the DLDO. The proposed design is fabricated in a 65nm CMOS process with an active area of 0.00634 mm2. Measurement results show that the rising-edge settling time and falling-edge settling time of the PWM power output are 16.3 ns and 14 ns, respectively, which effectively reduces the limit of the edge settling time to the achievable PWM duty cycle range. Under a 2 MHz PWM frequency, this design can achieve PWM duty cycles ranging from 5.92% to 97.2%, corresponding to output power ranging from 1.47 mW to 24.12 mW.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Control for Power System Signal Processing: A Joint Edge Collaboration and Relay Assistance Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11133475</link><description>This brief presents a signal processing system and its optimize control strategy for power systems.

However, when the deep neural network (DNN) accelerator performs inference tasks at the edge end, the sensitive data of DNN will generate leakage through side-channel information. The adversary can recover the model structure and weight parameters of DNN by using the side-channel information, which seriously affects the protection of necessary intellectual property (IP) of DNN, so the hardware security of the DNN accelerator is critical. In the current research of Side-channel attack (SCA) for matrix multiplication units, such as systolic arrays, the linear multiplication operation leads to a more extensive weights search space for the SCA, and extracting all the weight parameters requires higher attack conditions. This article proposes a new power SCA method, which includes a Collision-Correlation Power Analysis (Collision-CPA) and Correlation-based Weight Search Algorithm (C-WSA) to address the problem. The Collision-CPA reduces the attack conditions for the SCA by building multiple Hamming Distance (HD)-based power leakage models for the systolic array. Meanwhile, the C-WSA dramatically reduces the weights search space. In addition, the concept of a Side-channel star map (SCSM) is proposed for the first time in this article, and the adversary can quickly and accurately locate the correct weight information in the SCSM. Through experiments, we recover all the weight parameters of a  $3\times 3$  systolic array based on 100000 power traces, in which the weight search space is reduced by up to 97.7%. For the DNN accelerator at the edge, especially the systolic array structure, our proposed novel SCA aligns more with practical attack scenarios, with lower attack conditions, and higher attack efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Model Switching in RRAM-Based DNN Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10922769</link><description>Resistive random access memory (RRAM) has emerged as a promising technology for deep neural network (DNN) accelerators, but programming every weight in a DNN onto RRAM cells for inference can be both time-consuming and energy-intensive, especially when switching between different DNN models. This article introduces a hardware-aware multimodel merging (HA3M) framework designed to minimize the need for reprogramming by maximizing weight reuse, while taking into account the hardware constraints of the accelerator. The framework includes three key approaches: 1) crossbar (XB)-aware model mapping (XAMM); 2) block-based layer matching (BLM); and 3) multimodel retraining (MMR). XAMM reduces the XB usage of the preprogrammed model on RRAM XBs while preserving the model&#8217;s structure. BLM reuses preprogrammed weights in a block-based manner, ensuring the inference process remains unchanged. MMR then equalizes the block-based matched weights across multiple models. Experimental results show that the proposed framework significantly reduces programming cycles in multi-DNN switching scenarios while maintaining or even enhancing accuracy, and eliminating the need for reprogramming.</description></item><item><title>CMD: A Cache-Assisted GPU Memory Deduplication Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10930882</link><description>Massive off-chip accesses in graphics processing units (GPUs) are the main performance bottleneck. We find that many writes are duplicate, and the duplication can be inter-dup and intra-dup. While inter-dup means different memory blocks are identical, and intra-dup means all the 4B elements in a line are the same. In this work, we propose a cache-assisted GPU memory deduplication architecture named cache-assisted GPU memory deduplicated (CMD) to reduce the off-chip accesses via utilizing the data duplication in GPU applications. CMD includes three key design contributions which aim to reduce the three kinds of accesses: 1) a novel GPU memory deduplication architecture that removes the intra-dup and inter-dup lines. We design several techniques to manage duplicate blocks, reducing massive off-chip writes; 2) we propose a cache-assisted read scheme to reduce the reads to duplicate data. When an L2 cache miss wants to read the duplicate block, if the reference block has been fetched to L2 and it is clean, we can copy it to the L2 missed block without accessing off-chip DRAM. As for the reads to intra-dup data, CMD uses the on-chip metadata cache to get the data; and 3) when a cache line is evicted, the clean sectors in the line are invalidated while the dirty sectors are written back. However, most read-only victims are rereferenced from DRAM more than twice. Therefore, we add a full-associate FIFO to accommodate the read-only (it is also clean) victims to reduce the rereference counts. Experiments show that CMD can decrease the off-chip accesses by 31.01%, reduce the energy by 32.78% and improve performance by 42.53%. Besides, CMD can improve the performance of memory-intensive workloads by 57.56%.</description></item><item><title>GPOS: A General and Precise Offloading Strategy for High Generality of DNN Acceleration by OCP and NDP Co-Optimizing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10939009</link><description>The arithmetic intensity (ArI) of different DNNs can be opposite. This challenges the generality of single acceleration architectures, including both dedicated on-chip processing (OCP) and near-data processing (NDP). Neither architecture can simultaneously achieve optimal energy efficiency and performance for operators with opposite ArI. It is relatively straightforward to think of combining the respective advantages of OCP and NDP. However, few publications have addressed their real-time co-optimization, primarily due to the lack of a quantifiable offloading method. Here, we propose GPOS, a general and precise offloading strategy that supports high generality of DNN acceleration. GPOS comprehensively considers the complex interactions between OCP and NDP, including hardware configurations, dataflow (DF), DNN model, and interdie data movements (DMs). Three quantifiable indicators&#8212;ArI, execution cost (Ex-cost), and DM-cost&#8212;are employed to precisely evaluate the impacts of these interactions on energy and latency. GPOS adopts a four-step flow with progressive refinement: each of the first three steps focuses on a single indicator at the operator level, while the final step performs context-based calibration to address operator interdependencies and avoid offsetting NDP benefits. Narrowing down offloading candidates in step 1 and step 3 significantly accelerates real-time quantitative analysis. Optimized mapping techniques and NDP-input stationary DF are proposed to reduce Ex-cost and extend operator types supported by NDP. Next, for the first time, sparsity&#8212;one of the most popular methods for energy optimization that can alter data reuse or ArI&#8212;is quantitatively investigated for its impacts on offloading using GPOS. Our evaluations include representative DNNs, including GPT-2, Bert, RNN, CNN, and MLP. GPOS achieves the minimum energy and latency for each benchmark, with geometric mean speedups of 49.0% and 94.1%, and geometric mean energy savings of 45.8% and 89.2% over All-OCP and All-NDP, respectively. GPOS also reduces offloading analysis latency by a geometric mean of 92.7% compared to the evaluation that traverses each operator and its relative combinations. On average, sparsity further improves performance and energy efficiency by increasing the number of operators offloaded to NDP. However, for DNNs where all operators exhibit either very high or very low ArI, the number of offloaded operators remains unchanged, even after sparsity is applied.</description></item><item><title>Efficient and Scalable Post-Layout Optimization for Field-Coupled Nanotechnologies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916761</link><description>As conventional computing technologies approach their physical limits, the quest for increased computational power intensifies, heightening interest in post-CMOS technologies. Among these, Field-coupled Nanocomputing (FCN), which operates through the repulsion of physical fields at the nanoscale, emerges as a promising alternative. However, realizing specific functionalities within this technology necessitates the development of dedicated FCN physical design methods. Although various methods have been proposed, their reliance on heuristic approaches often results in suboptimal quality, highlighting a significant opportunity for enhancement. In the realm of conventional CMOS design, post-layout optimization techniques are employed to capitalize on this potential, yet such methods for FCN are either not scalable or lack efficiency. This work bridges this gap by introducing the first scalable and efficient post-layout optimization algorithm for FCN. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficiency of this approach: when applied to layouts obtained by a state-of-the-art heuristic method, the proposed post-layout optimization achieves area reductions of up to  $ {\mathrm {73.75~\%}}~({\mathrm {45.58~\%}}$  on average). This significant improvement underscores the transformative potential of post-layout optimization in FCN. Moreover, unlike existing algorithms, the method exhibits scalability even in optimizing layouts with over 20 million tiles. Implementations of the proposed methods are publicly available as part of the Munich Nanotech Toolkit (MNT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/fiction.</description></item><item><title>PTPS: Precision-Aware Task Partitioning and Scheduling for SpMV on CPU-FPGA Heterogeneous Platforms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10937993</link><description>The CPU-FPGA heterogeneous computing architecture is extensively employed in the embedded domain due to its low cost and power efficiency, with numerous sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) acceleration efforts already targeting this architecture. However, existing work rarely includes collaborative SpMV computations between CPU and FPGA, which limits the exploration of hybrid architectures that could potentially offer enhanced performance and flexibility. This article introduces an FPGA architecture design that supports multiprecision SpMV computations, including FP16, FP32, and FP64. Building on this, PTPS, a precision-aware SpMV task partitioning and dynamic scheduling algorithm tailored for the CPU-FPGA heterogeneous architecture, is proposed. The core idea of PTPS is lossless partitioning of sparse matrices across multiple precisions, prioritizing low-precision SpMV computations on the FPGA and high-precision computations on the CPU. PTPS not only leverages the strengths of CPU and FPGA for collaborative SpMV computations but also reduces data transmission overhead between them, thereby improving the overall computational efficiency. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed approach offers an average speedup of  $1.57\times $  over the CPU-only approach and  $2.58\times $  over the FPGA-only approach.</description></item><item><title>GRACE: An End-to-End Graph Processing Accelerator on FPGA With Graph Reordering Engine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10939011</link><description>Graphs play an important role in various applications. With the rapid expansion of vertices in real life, existing large-scale graph processing frameworks on CPUs and GPUs encounter challenges in optimizing cache usage due to irregular memory access patterns. To address this, graph reordering has been proposed to improve the locality of the graph, but introduces significant overhead without delivering substantial end-to-end performance improvement. While there have been many FPGA-based accelerators for graph processing, achieving high throughput often requires complex graph prepossessing on CPUs. Therefore, implementing an efficient end-to-end graph processing system remains challenging. This article introduces GRACE, an end-to-end FPGA-based graph processing accelerator with a graph reordering engine and a pull-based vertex-centric programming model (PL-VCPM) Engine. First, GRACE employs a customized high-degree vertex cache (HDC) to improve memory access efficiency. Second, GRACE offloads the graph preprocessing to FPGA. We customize an efficient graph reordering engine to complete preprocessing. Third, GRACE adopts a graph pruning strategy to remove the activation and computation redundancy in graph processing. Finally, GRACE introduces a graph conflict board (GCB) to resolve data conflicts and a multiport cache to enhance parallel efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that GRACE achieves  $7.1 \times $  end-to-end performance speedup over CPU and  $1.8 \times $  over GPU, as well as  $27.3 \times $  and  $8.7 \times $  energy efficiency over CPU and GPU. Moreover, GRACE delivers up to  $34.9 \times $  performance speedup compared to the state-of-the-art FPGA accelerator.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Sample Preparation With Fully Programmable Valve Arrays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10926526</link><description>The 2-D architecture of fully programmable valve arrays (FPVAs) is designed as a crossbar consisting of reaction chambers and microvalves, functioning as a versatile, flow-based microfluidic lab-on-chip for implementing biochemical protocols. While an FPVA enables efficient execution of various fluidic operations&#8212;such as mixing, loading, and storage, transporting fluids between chambers remains a challenging task. Furthermore, mapping a general mixing tree (representing a sequence of mixing steps) onto an FPVA is complex. It requires careful placement of reagents into specific chambers and the scheduling of subsequent mixing operations. Most sample preparation algorithms aim to generate a minimum-depth mixing tree to achieve the target mixing ratio. However, due to constraints on fluid transportation and scheduling, such a tree may not be the most practical for FPVA implementation. In this article, we harness the power of a satisfiability solver to derive a skewed mixing tree/graph that can be efficiently mapped onto an FPVA using a single mixer. This approach localizes most fluidic operations to a small region of the crossbar. Simulation results show that, for most mixing ratios, a skewed mixing tree can be found which not only reduces fluid-transportation distance and scheduling complexities but also the number of loading cycles, reagent volumes, and waste production in sample preparation, when compared to the approach based on the minimum-depth mixing tree.</description></item><item><title>Evaluation of FONOS FDSOI FET for Synapse-Inspired Artificial Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10930942</link><description>In this article, a well calibrated FDSOI ferroelectric (Fe)-FET/FeFET is gate-stacked with a charge trap nitride (CTN) for investigating memory and synaptic applications. The CTN is sandwiched between Fe and silicon channel of FeFET to obtain ferroelectric/oxide/nitride/oxide/semiconductor (FONOS) FET for improved memory and synaptic applications. This approach of using both Fe and CTN layers to improve memory and synaptic applications is labeled as hybrid approach. Since, both the Fe or CTN as a standalone gate-stack dielectric can give threshold-voltage ( $V_{T}$ ) shift leading to hysteresis transfer characteristics with a program (PGM)/erase (ERS) schemes that predict a memory window (MW). The FeFET uses spontaneous polarization ( $P_{S}$ ) to obtain memory operation which offer low power and area. The CTN uses highly mature and reliable charge-trapping-memory (CTM)-based e ${}^{-} $ /h+ trapping  $\Leftrightarrow $  de-trapping mechanism with PGM/ERS scheme to obtain MW that has high- $V_{T}$  (HVT) and low- $V_{T}$  (LVT) transfer characteristics. Hence, a combination of these leading to a FONOS FET architecture, which is investigated for improved memory properties like MW and retention followed by examining on synaptic attributes for realistic device training accuracy toward artificial neural networks (ANNs). From the investigations: 1) FONOS memory device has predicted improvement in MW with 2.65 V for 8-nm thick CTN layer and retention of Fe-electric field ( $E_{\mathrm { Fe}}$ ) and charge density for  $\approx 11$  years and 2) synaptic device has shown an accuracy of 93% for MNIST digit dataset in ANNs. These predictions from the FONOS FET aimed at providing hybrid solutions to next-generation devices with extended applications in memory and neuromorphic applications with reliable device operation.</description></item><item><title>Ultralow Power Zirconium Electrolyte-Based Synaptic Device for Neuromorphic Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10926909</link><description>This work presents a novel electrolyte-based artificial synaptic device mimicking mammalian synaptic behavior because of an Electric Double Layer (EDL) for various neural-based applications. ZrO2, as an Electrolyte, with Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide (IGZO) as a channel material, has been utilised for Synaptic Device (ZEISD). A novel electrolyte, ZrO2, with intercalation property, produces synaptic behaviors similar to biological neurons. The device shows sound synaptic functions, such as excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC), inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC), and paired-pulse facilitation (PPF). With different spike amplitudes and frequencies, the device transitions from short-term potentiation (STP) to long-term potentiation (LTP) and depression characteristics, an essential neural behavior. FERMI, PRINT, and SRH modelling have been utilised to obtain neural behaviors. A higher On/Off ratio  $\approx ~10^{5}$  has been obtained in line with designed and calibrated synaptic devices with ultralow power consumption as low as 0.162 pJ. Our findings hold significant implications for advancing the field of artificial neuromorphic devices, allowing for the creation of adaptable, dynamic functionalities.</description></item><item><title>An Optimization-Aware Prerouting Timing Prediction Framework Based on Multimodal Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909720</link><description>Accurate and efficient prerouting timing estimation is particularly crucial during placement to alleviate time-consuming design iterations. Machine-learning (ML)-based methods have been introduced recently to predict the post-routing timing results at placement stage, but most of them neglect the impact of timing optimization during physical design, suffering from accuracy loss due to inconsistent circuit netlist. In this work, an optimization-aware prerouting timing prediction framework based on multimodal learning is proposed to calibrate the timing changes between placement and routing stages, where the local netlist and layout information are extracted by graph neural network (GNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN), respectively, while the global information along the path is further extracted by Transformer network. Based on the predicted post-routing timing results by the proposed framework, timing optimization guidance is generated to enhance traditional design flow with better physical implementation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that for the OpenCores benchmark circuits under TSMC 22nm process, the proposed framework achieves significant correlation and accuracy improvement with an average of 0.9219 in terms of R2 score and 2.12% of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as well as an average runtime acceleration of  $645\times $  compared with traditional design flow on testing designs. With the timing optimization guidance, significant worst negative slack (WNS) and total negative slack (TNS) improvement are achieved compared with traditional flow after placement and routing, respectively, without noticeable area, power, wire length, and the number of design rule check (DRC) violations increase.</description></item><item><title>SaaP: Rearchitect SoC-as-a-Processor to Orchestrate Hardware Heterogeneity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10935670</link><description>Due to the end of Moore&#8217;s Law and Dennard Scaling, Domain-Specific Accelerators (DSAs) have come to a Cambrian explosion. Especially when advancing into the intelligent era, more and more DSAs are integrated into System-on-Chips (SoCs) as intellectual property (IP) blocks to provide high performance and efficiency. Currently, IPs usually expose IP-dependent hardware interfaces, requiring SoCs to manage them as isolated devices with software running on the host CPU. However, such software-managed heterogeneity in CPU-centric SoCs leads to low IP utilization. This inefficiency arises from the dependence on software optimization, coupled with the control and data exchange overheads. To improve IP utilization of heterogeneous SoCs, in this article, we rearchitect the SoC as a processor (i.e., SaaP) to orchestrate hardware heterogeneity. SaaP features an orchestration pipeline where DSAs are integrated as execution units and managed directly by the hardware pipeline to conceal the hardware heterogeneity from software. Moreover, SaaP redesigns the register file and data paths to implement an IP-level data-forwarding mechanism, avoiding the costly control and data exchange in the CPU-centric execution model. Block data dependence among different DSAs is carefully resolved to exploit mixed-level parallelism and inter-IP data exchange. SaaP abstracts tasks as mixed-scale instructions, where each instruction can be mapped to different IPs. Experimental results show that compared against Xavier on six fully software-optimized benchmarks from different domains, SaaP-rearchitected Xavier achieves a  $2.08{\times }$  speedup, with an 8.21% area reduction and only 2.98% increase in power consumption.</description></item><item><title>On Optimizing Inter- and Intra-Chiplet Interconnection Topologies for Robust Multi-Chiplet Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10922749</link><description>Inter- and intra-chiplet interconnection networks play a vital role in the operation of many core systems made of multiple chiplets. However, these networks are susceptible to faults caused by manufacturing defects and attacks resulting from the malicious insertion of hardware Trojans and backdoors. Unlike conventional fault-tolerant or countermeasure methods, this article focuses on optimizing network robustness to withstand both faults and attacks, while considering the constraints of chiplet area and power budget. To achieve this, this article first defines network robustness as a quantifiable measure based on various network parameters, after which an optimization problem is formulated to optimize the robustness of the network topology. To efficiently solve this problem, a reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is capable of generating inter- and intra-chiplet interconnection networks that are significantly more robust than existing topology generation methods. Specifically, the proposed method improves robustness over ButterDonut and Kite, respectively, by an average of 10.88% and 14.06% under random faults and by 9.37% and 7.81% under targeted attacks. These experimental results confirm that the proposed method is capable of generating robust inter- and intra-chiplet interconnection networks that can withstand both faults and attacks. By optimizing the network topology&#8217;s robustness, it provides a valuable contribution to the design and security of chiplet-based core systems.</description></item><item><title>Intermittent-Friendly Neural Architecture Search: Demystifying Accuracy and Overhead Tradeoffs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10944793</link><description>The fusion of tiny energy harvesting devices with deep neural networks (DNN) optimized for intermittent execution is vital for sustainable intelligent applications at the edge. However, current intermittent-aware neural architecture search (NAS) frameworks overlook the inherent intermittency management overhead (IMO) of DNNs, leading to under-performance upon deployment. Moreover, we observe that straightforward IMO minimization within NAS may degrade solution accuracy. This work explores the relationship between DNN architectural characteristics, IMO, and accuracy, uncovering the varying sensitivity toward IMO across different DNN characteristics. Inspired by our insights, we present two guidelines for leveraging IMO sensitivity in NAS. First, the overall architecture search space can be reduced to exclude parameters with low IMO sensitivity, and second, network blocks with high IMO sensitivity can be primarily focused during the search, facilitating the discovery of highly accurate networks with low IMO. We incorporate these guidelines into TiNAS, which integrates cutting-edge tiny NAS and intermittent-aware NAS frameworks. Evaluations are conducted across various datasets and latency requirements, as well as deployment experiments on a Texas Instruments device under different intermittent power profiles. Compared to two variants, one minimizing IMO and the other disregarding IMO, TiNAS, respectively, achieves up to 38% higher accuracy and 33% lower IMO, with greater improvements for larger datasets. Its deployed solutions also achieve up to a 1.33 times inference speedup, especially under fluctuating power conditions.</description></item><item><title>Formal Synthesis of Neural Barrier Certificates for Dynamical Systems via DC Programming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10943236</link><description>Barrier certificate generation is an ingenious and powerful approach for safety verification of cyber-physical systems. This article suggests a new learning and verification framework that helps to achieve the balance between the representation ability and the verification efficiency for neural barrier certificates. In the learning phase, it learns candidate barrier certificates represented as convex difference neural networks (CDiNNs). Since CDiNNs can be rewritten as difference of convex (DC) functions that can express any twice differentiable function, thus have outstanding representation ability and flexibility. In the verification phase, it employs an efficient approach for formally verifying the validity of the neural candidates via DC programming. Due to the convexity-based structure, CDiNNs can significantly facilitate the verification process. We conduct an experimental evaluation over a set of benchmarks, which validates that our method is much more efficient and effective than the state-of-the-art approaches.</description></item><item><title>Fully Programmatic Automated Design Procedure of Comparators for Analog-to-Digital Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10963892</link><description>This article proposes a system-aware, fully programmatic and automated, process agnostic design methodology, which utilizes system-level simulations with the layout parasitics of the circuit under optimization included.

The procedure is shown to effectively converge toward performance achieved with ideal comparator in post-layout across two different semiconductor processes. While the methodology was demonstrated for design of comparators, the proposed system-aware methodology is generally applicable to any analog circuit, drastically reducing design time while providing a silicon ready circuit implementation purpose designed to the higher level system without human-in-the-loop.</description></item><item><title>Make It Easy!
