CCM model-based control methods suffer from degraded performance under such conditions, whereas hybrid model-based control methods are limited by complex mathematical formulations of logical variables, piecewise structures, and inequalities and high computational costs. This article proposes a state quadrant modeling approach, which includes circuit state classification and state descriptor construction, offering high-precision and simplifying models for model-based control. The circuit state classification method identifies circuit states based on freewheeling conditions and current trends, ensuring comprehensive coverage of operating scenarios and enhancing modeling accuracy. Furthermore, the state descriptor construction method employs logical operations to derive one or two logical variables that uniformly represent different circuit states, eliminating the need for inequalities and piecewise structures. This method is highly scalable and applicable to single-inductor, dual-inductor, multiphase, and isolated converters. It significantly enhances control performance, simplifies design, and improves computational efficiency when integrated into model-based control methods. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed models achieve 99.99% accuracy relative to simulink results and 98.99% accuracy relative to experimental results. They also reduce computation time by 36.85% in model predictive control and decrease voltage response time by 35.69%.</description></item><item><title>Multimodal Split-Bus Boost-LLC Resonant Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11204831</link><description>This article proposes a multimodal split-bus boost-LLC resonant converter suitable for wide-range applications. In the proposed topology, the bus of the conventional full-bridge LLC resonant converter is split. Specifically, the bus of the first half-bridge arm is directly connected to the input voltage source, while the bus of the second half-bridge arm is boosted by an integrated boost circuit formed by the boost inductor connected to the input voltage source and the second bridge arm. A fixed-frequency duty cycle control is applied to the second switching bridge arm to raise its bus voltage, thereby adjusting the equivalent input voltage of the resonant tank and modifying the voltage gain of the converter. In addition, through topological reconfiguration, the primary-side inverter bridge can transition from full-bridge mode to half-bridge mode, enabling the converter to achieve a fourfold voltage gain range. Finally, a 1-kW laboratory prototype with 400 V input and 200&#8211;800 V output voltage was developed. Experimental results show that the prototype achieved 97.5% peak efficiency under full-bridge LLC mode, which increased to 97.8% when operating in half-bridge LLC mode. The efficiency remained above 96.2% within the whole output voltage range under the rated output current.</description></item><item><title>Modulated Parameter-Less Predictive Voltage Control for Dual-Active-Bridge Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165003</link><description>Conventional model-based predictive voltage control in dual-active-bridge (DAB) converters suffers from voltage regulation limitations because the limited phase-shift angle candidate set impacts dynamic response and the parametric sensitivity impacts robustness. To address the above limitations, this letter proposes a modulated parameter-less predictive voltage control (MPL-PVC), where a parameter-less modeling architecture replaces the conventional mathematical models, eliminating dependence on precise circuit parameters through real-time parameter-less model updating, and a modulated optimal phase-shift angle calculation replaces conventional phase-shift angle candidate set, enhancing voltage regulation capacity while decoupling control performance from parametric variations. Experimental validation on a DAB prototype confirms the effectiveness of proposed MPL-PVC in enhancing dynamic performance and eliminating parametric effect.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Spatial Temperature Monitoring of Power Modules via Fourier Neural Operator-Based Thermal Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168963</link><description>Accurate monitoring of power module spatial temperature (PMST) remains a critical challenge in power electronics. This letter proposes a Fourier neural operator-based thermal model (FNO-TM) to enable efficient and precise prediction of PMST for the first time. Built on a data-driven paradigm, FNO-TM extracts spatial-frequency features, facilitating faster convergence and reduced training costs compared to conventional neural networks. To further enhance generalization, a Trunk-and-Branch architecture is employed to adapt to varying boundary conditions. In addition, an electrothermal coupling strategy tailored for FNO-TM is developed and validated on a practical inverter platform. Experimental results show that FNO-TM maintains high accuracy across different current levels and cooling conditions, with maximum errors below 1.8&#176;C. Furthermore, the PMST prediction is completed within 0.1 s, significantly outperforming traditional methods in computational efficiency. The prediction accuracy can be further enhanced through fine-tuning with measured data. These features make FNO-TM a promising solution for thermal monitoring and digital twin applications in power electronics.</description></item><item><title>Dissipation-Based Dynamics-Aware Learning Scheme for Transient Stability Analysis of Networked Black-Box Grid-Forming Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11175507</link><description>Dissipation-based stability analysis, leveraging Lyapunov functions, is popular for assessing the transient stability of inverter-based power systems. However, the proprietary nature of vendor-specific inverter control schemes often results in &#8220;black-box&#8221; inverter models with limited transparency, while there remains a need for a &#8220;generalized&#8221; transient stability assessment framework, as opposed to the case-specific designs typically employed in current practice. To address these limitations, this letter proposes a dissipation-based dynamics-aware learning scheme for transient stability analysis of power grids with networked black-box grid-forming inverters. Unlike classical black-box modeling approaches that learn pointwise trajectory mappings as output characteristics, the proposed method directly learns state variable derivatives to uncover the underlying dynamics that govern system evolution. Leveraging the universal approximation capability of neural networks (NNs), the unknown system dynamics are first captured by a NN. Subsequently, data sampled from this NN facilitates the training of a separate NN that represents the Lyapunov function. The proposed bilevel approach enables generalized transient stability evaluation for highly nonlinear system without requiring explicit system models, making it applicable to diverse practical scenarios. Case studies are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Repairable, Recyclable, and Reliable Power Electronics Using Liquid Metal Interconnection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11175024</link><description>The progression of power electronics technologies prioritizes efficiency and power density, often paying scant attention to the converter&#8217;s own lifecycle environmental impact, resulting in significant and unnecessary waste. Traditional packaging and assembling methods of power electronic devices and converters rely on rigid bonding, such as soldering and sintering, to interconnect parts, causing challenges of disassembling and separating parts when repairing and recycling are needed. This letter introduces liquid metal (LM) as a bonding mechanism in power electronic device packaging and converter assembling. The fluidic interconnection using LM is invented to enable parts separation and thermomechanical stress reduction without compromising electrical performance. Therefore, repairable, recyclable, and reliable power electronics is achieved. Straightforward assembling and disassembling processes are demonstrated by a real repair case of the LM-based power stage. Electrical performance is validated by a buck converter, achieving an efficiency of up to 98.2%.</description></item><item><title>Multiparameter Identification Algorithm With Constant-Voltage Control for Fractional-Order Wireless Power Transfer Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11204690</link><description>Fractional-order wireless power transfer (FOWPT) systems improve robustness by utilizing fractional-order components, addressing the performance degradation of traditional integer-order systems caused by parameter variations. However, they are still limited by the load range, coupling distance, and resonant frequency offset. Moreover, existing research seldom considers the influence of multiparameter changes such as coil self-inductance, mutual inductance, and load on the output characteristics in practical applications. Therefore, this letter proposes a parameter identification method for FOWPT system based on differential evolution algorithm, which realizes the simultaneous identification of multiple parameters including load, self-inductance, and mutual inductance. Based on the parameter identification results, a constant-voltage output control strategy is further presented. Experimental results show that the system stably outputs 12 V with an error of only 0.083%, verifying the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method and providing new insights for the optimization and application of FOWPT systems.</description></item><item><title>Turn-on Switching Loss Reduction for 10 kV SiC mosfets Without Increasing dv/dt Using Desat Protection Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11206520</link><description>Enabled by the fast switching capability of emerging 10 kV SiC mosfets, medium voltage (MV) power converters can achieve significantly reduced power loss. However, high dv/dt of 10 kV SiC mosfets also poses challenges for MV converter design. This letter proposes a simple method to reduce turn-on switching loss of 10 kV SiC mosfet without increasing dv/dt. The proposed circuit employs a widely used desat short-circuit protection circuit to determine the dv/dt stage of the turn-on switching transient and adjust the gate resistance to accelerate current rise period, while maintaining voltage fall period unchanged. The proposed circuit can achieve switching loss reduction under various dc voltages and load currents similar to a closed-loop active gate driver, but the circuit required is quite simple.

During testing, the measurement circuit must accurately detect the brief low-voltage portion of VDS while withstanding its full high-voltage swing, which presents significant challenges for circuit design. This letter introduces a novel approach for measuring turn-off delay times by detecting the current across the gate-loop resistor caused by the displacement current in the counterpart switch. In this case, the detection circuit can be entirely implemented using gate drive signals without detecting VDS and fully integrated into the gate driver, enhancing the flexibility of applications utilizing turn-off delay time for online junction temperature monitoring. Subsequently, a nonisolated circuit design (requiring fewer components) is presented, calibrated with a double-pulse test, and further validated through continuous operation in a buck converter.</description></item><item><title>An Antimisalignment Electric Vehicle Wireless Charging System Based on Two Transmitting Coils With LCC-S Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11218841</link><description>In an electric vehicle (EV) wireless power transfer system, a critical challenge is to address mutual inductance variations and output fluctuations caused by the misalignment along the lateral direction of the EV. This letter proposes an antimisalignment method using two transmitting coils. First, an inductor&#8211;capacitor&#8211;capacitor series topology is adopted on the transmitting side. The relationship between the output voltage and the mutual inductance is derived, and a compensation parameter design method is proposed. Second, an output voltage compensation method is proposed to enhance the misalignment tolerance performance. Finally, an experimental prototype is built to verify the validity of the theory. The experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve an output performance of 200 V and 1 kW, with a peak efficiency of 95.17% over the misalignment range.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Frequency Ultra-Wide-Load Resonant Inverter for Electrosurgical Generator System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224601</link><description>This letter presents a dual-frequency electrosurgical generator (ESG) based on a Class EF inverter, designed to accommodate ultra-wide impedance variations encountered during surgical procedures. The inherent load-insensitive characteristics of the Class EF inverter at a single frequency are further enhanced through the adoption of a dual-frequency operation strategy. To explore the design potential, inequality constraints and an impedance-based analysis method are employed. High operational efficiency is established as the primary design goal, and a simple dual-frequency and current control scheme is implemented to maintain stable output power. In the experimental validation, a 3/4-MHz ESG system is developed, achieving an efficiency above 63% and delivering 20 W of output power across a wide load range of 50&#8211;1500 $\Omega$.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Capacitance Extraction Method for Multichip Power Modules for EMI Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151216</link><description>Extracting parasitic capacitances in multichip power modules (MCPMs) is essential for reliable electromagnetic interference (EMI) analysis, especially in switching systems such as automotive inverters or converters. Such applications increasingly employ multibridge MCPMs&#8212;where multiple half-bridge cells are integrated and each bridge drives a different motor or load&#8212; making the characterization of capacitance more critical. Conventional approaches, such as curve tracers and transient fitting techniques, suffer from limitations including single-frequency measurement, a complex measurement setup, and the need for repeated tests under different bias conditions. These drawbacks limit their practicality for complex module-level characterization. This article proposes a generalized capacitance extraction method based on two-port S-parameter measurements. The proposed method enables modeling of both static and dynamic capacitances under various voltage biases, with minimal reconfiguration of terminal connections. Experimental validation using a commercial IGBT-based MCPM demonstrated that the proposed method significantly reduces setup complexity compared to conventional measurements. These results confirm that the method is effective for EMI analysis and modeling of advanced MCPMs.</description></item><item><title>GaN-Based Inductive Charging DOS Pulse Generator Using IGBT-Isolated Modules With Bipolar Output and Adjustable Stacking for DBD Plasma Jet</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11157733</link><description>High-frequency, fast-rising nanosecond pulses have attracted considerable interest in various fields, particularly for driving dielectric barrier discharge plasma jets. The rapid reverse cutoff of diodes enables the diode opening switch (DOS) to generate ultrashort nanosecond pulses. However, it relies on small resistors and a high-power dc source for high-frequency operation, leading to low charging voltage gain and significant charging losses. Additionally, the limited controllability of diodes makes it difficult to adjust output polarity. Herein, a new DOS utilizing GaN with LC charging (L-DOS) is proposed. An inductor stores energy that is dissipated in the charging resistor of traditional DOS, achieving a higher charging voltage gain. Additionally, a new modular L-DOS circuit with IGBT isolation is designed. IGBT provides a controlled current path for the fast-rising pulses generated by the diodes, allowing for bipolar output with adjustable stacking. Results show that L-DOS achieves a fivefold increase in charging voltage gain with only 25% of the charging loss of traditional DOS, thereby enabling the generation of 5.8-kV pulses with a duration of 6.8 ns under a low input voltage of 100 V. The 4-stage prototype can not only output bipolar pulses but also achieve amplitude stacking up to 10.6 kV and bipolar frequency stacking up to 2 MHz.</description></item><item><title>Achieving ZVS in Asymmetrical Half-Bridge Structures: A Thorough Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11164343</link><description>As the demand for more efficient and compact power converters grows, the trend points to a progressive raise of their switching frequency. However, even with wide-bandgap semiconductors, switching losses limit the maximum frequency at which they can operate, requiring zero-voltage switching (ZVS) to maximize efficiency and to prevent overheating. Existing studies state that the conditions to achieve ZVS depend only on the stored charge in the output parasitic capacitances of the transistors, but this statement is not applicable for the asymmetrical half-bridge (AHB) structure defined in this article, commonly found in topologies such as the buck and the asymmetrical half-bridge flyback. This article addresses this limitation by deriving a novel condition for achieving complete ZVS in the AHB, showing that both, the stored charge and the stored energy in the transistors must be considered. It also proposes a simplified circuit for analyzing dead times and discusses the issue of having different switches in a half-bridge, stating the advantage of placing high capacitance transistors in the low-side. Furthermore, this article proposes some consideration for dimensioning the converter that facilitate achieving ZVS. Experimental measurements validate the theoretical analysis, demonstrating its potential in the design of high efficiency and high power density converters.</description></item><item><title>Safe-Operation-Area Extended IGBT Module With Enhanced Near-Junction Thermal Capacitance and Advanced Cooling for Transient High-Current Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11184245</link><description>With the growing integration of renewable energy sources, grid-connected converters are expected to provide overcurrent (OC) capability similar to those of synchronous generators. To address this challenge, we propose a power module that incorporates both enhanced near-junction thermal capacitance (NJTC) and exceptional cooling capacity. The module utilizes copper blocks as top-side interconnects, substantially enhancing NJTC and enabling dual thermal paths. Concurrently, it integrates a substrate-embedded manifold microchannel (MMC) heatsink to achieve ultralow thermal resistance. Using the simulation-optimized structural parameters of the NJTC and MMC heat sink, a 1200 V/100 A IGBT half-bridge power module with reliable connections is fabricated through silver sintering technology. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed module achieves a 50% higher steady-state current-carrying capacity than the pin-fin module at identical junction temperatures. Under OC conditions, the module operates stably for 3.33 s at 3 p.u. (per unit) with 1000 W heat dissipation per IGBT. At 2.5 p.u., it sustains safe operation over extended periods, outperforming the pin-fin module by a factor of ten. The heat extraction of different mechanisms during OC conditions is quantitatively analyzed through simulation. Double-pulse test results indicate that the proposed module exhibits a parasitic inductance of 25.91 nH, including the parasitics of the test circuit, which is slightly lower than that of typical wire-bonded modules. The demonstrated safe-operation-area extension makes this packaging approach highly promising for future high-reliability, high-performance grid-connected converter systems.</description></item><item><title>Partial Power Converter Based on the Gate Voltage Self-Balancing Supercascode Power Switch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11184860</link><description>To simplify the topology and control under medium-voltage dc input, a novel partial power dc transformer (DCX) based on gate voltage self-balancing supercascode power switches (GVSB-SCPSs) is proposed. The front stage of DCX is constructed by GVSB-SCPSs, which realize the medium-voltage dc input of a single module and a fixed voltage ratio. The closed-loop stabilized voltage output is achieved through the proposed partial power processing circuit, which handles a small portion of the output power. In the proposed converter, the high-frequency operation process of GVSB-SCPSs and the unique gate switching pattern during the dead time are analyzed. Based on this, the boundary condition of soft switching in the proposed converter is derived. Under this condition, the loss of the proposed converter is analyzed, and the dead time is optimally designed. Based on the proposed topology, a partial power converter experimental prototype is built. The prototype is constructed through the designed GVSB-SCPSs, which have been tested at 10 kV and demonstrate outstanding switching characteristics. The experimental results of the partial power converter prototype show that all the GVSB-SCPSs realize a ZVS soft switch at 4 kV, 20 kHz. Furthermore, the closed-loop stabilized voltage output is achieved, verifying the feasibility of the proposed PPP and DCX circuit.</description></item><item><title>Stability-Enhanced Low-Dropout Regulator With High PSRR in 40-nm CMOS for System-on-Chip Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11190462</link><description>Power supply noise can significantly degrade the performance of complex systems by reducing the signal-to-noise ratio. To address this, a low-dropout regulator (LDO) with both high power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) and robust stability under large load currents is essential. Conventional LDOs often face a trade-off between achieving high PSRR and maintaining stability, especially at large load currents and wide bandwidths. This article presents a simple yet effective LDO design approach that achieves excellent PSRR without compromising stability, even under large load current conditions. Two novel compensation techniques, adaptive zero compensation and dc-coupled zero compensation, are introduced to enhance stability margins. Stability is rigorously evaluated under process and temperature variations, as well as varying equivalent series resistance (RESR), load equivalent series inductance (LESL), and output capacitance. The proposed design demonstrates a phase margin exceeding 45 degrees and a gain margin greater than 10 dB in worst-case scenarios. Fabricated in 40-nm bulk CMOS technology, the LDO achieves PSRR greater than 60 dB up to 5 MHz and supports load currents up to 250 mA. It also delivers excellent line and load regulation, making it well suited for noise-sensitive system-on-chip applications that demand both high dynamic performance and enhanced stability.</description></item><item><title>Utilizing Silicone Gel Encapsulation in Power Semiconductor Module to Improve Manufacturability While Reducing Common-Mode Noise</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192658</link><description>The novel power module introduced in this article features an etched section of the bottom copper layer of a direct-bonded copper substrate, encapsulated in silicone gel.

The measured CM noise in prototype hardware was decreased by maximum 5 dB&#956;V in steady-state operation. Thermal cycling tests with a total of 1000 cycles confirmed the proposed power module does not compromise mechanical stability.</description></item><item><title>A &#8220;Hand-in-Hand&#8221; Dynamic Current-Sharing Layout for Hybrid Double-Sided Cooling GaN Module</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192784</link><description>Gallium nitride HEMTs provide exceptional advantages for high-power, space-constrained applications owing to their ultrahigh di/dt and dv/dt capabilities. However, these strengths render them prone to parasitics from layout, making current-sharing between multiple parallel chips difficult. This article develops a parasitic coupling network model for vertical commutation structures, quantitatively analyzing layout-dependent parameters (&#916;Ls, &#916;Ms, &#916;Mds, &#916;Mbs, &#916;Mpg, &#916;Mpks.) and their impact on current imbalance while offering optimized layout guidelines for power and gate-drive loops. A novel &#8220;hand-in-hand&#8221; parallel layout integrated with hybrid double-sided cooling is proposed, achieving parasitic consistency (&#916;Ls &#8804; 11.67%, &#916;Ms &#8804; 17.55%, &#916;Mds &#8804; 2.76%, &#916;Mbs &#8804; 1.96%, &#916;Mpg &#8804; 2.5%, and &#916;Mpks &#8804; 4.5%) and suppressing dynamic current deviation to &#916;Ion &#8804; 1.7 A and &#916;Ioff &#8804; 2.6 A. By adopting a unilateral gate-drive configuration, spacers are eliminated during heat dissipation substrate assembly, reducing thermal resistance by 50.5%. Experimental validation under 300 V, 48&#8211;208 A, and a case temperature range of 30&#8211;90 &#176;C confirms a current imbalance of less than 10%. Continuous operation at 300 V/50 A with forced-air cooling stabilizes module temperature at 33.6 &#176;C (deviation &lt; 1.8% from simulations), verifying thermal performance and sustained operational ability.</description></item><item><title>A Symmetrical Five-Switch Hybrid Boost Converter With Output Voltage Ripple Reduction and Right-Half-Plane Zero Elimination</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11193728</link><description>This article proposes a symmetrical five-switch hybrid (SFSH) boost converter, which has the same voltage conversion ratio as the conventional boost converter and eliminates the right-half-plane zero. By making the output current path always include an inductor current path and a capacitor current path, the continuity of the output current is enhanced and the ripple of output voltage is reduced. In addition, the SFSH converter solves the flying capacitor inrush current problem in extreme duty cycle, further reducing the conduction loss in capacitor path. An experimental prototype with switching frequency of 200 kHz is designed to verify the performance of the proposed converter. The measurement results demonstrate that the SFSH converter achieves a peak efficiency of 94.5% under the condition of $V_{IN}$ = 4 V, $V_{OUT}$ = 6 V, and $I_{Load}$ = 200 mA. Compared with conventional boost converter, the output voltage ripple is reduced by up to 40 mV. The recovery time is less than 120 &#956;s under the load transient between 100 and 500 mA.</description></item><item><title>Control Strategy Against Capacitance Degradation for BLDC Drives With Small DC-Link Capacitor in Series With IGBT</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165484</link><description>In brushless dc motor (BLDCM) drives with a small dc-link film capacitor and a series-connected IGBT, capacitor degradation can significantly compromise system performance and reliability. To address this challenge, this article proposes a control strategy specifically designed to mitigate capacitance degradation effects. The core of the strategy involves intentionally advancing the natural voltage separation point between the film capacitor and diode rectifier outputs, thus establishing an artificial voltage separation instant. This approach ensures that the capacitor voltage consistently remains above the peak ac voltage despite capacitor degradation, effectively compensating for reduced energy storage capability. Compared to the modulation strategy optimized for initial capacitor capacity, the proposed method only increases inverter switching actions during a limited portion of the control cycle in Zone I, without altering the switching frequency of the dc-link series IGBT. The proposed strategy does not require shutting down the system to replace the capacitor after degradation. Compared to the fault-tolerant topology of paralleling capacitors, the proposed strategy incurs no additional hardware cost. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Generalized INFORM Method for Low-Speed Position Sensorless Control of PMSM Using Single Current Sampling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11195770</link><description>In ac variable frequency drive systems, permanent magnet synchronous machines are highly favored for their remarkable efficiency, high power density, and compact mechanical structure. Position sensorless control of PMSMs offers notable advantages in enhancing reliability and reducing cost. At the same time, high-precision current sensors are expensive, and the use of single current sampling can further reduce costs. However, the reliability of position sensorless control, particularly at low speeds, is impacted by the distortion of applied voltage due to the phase shift of unmeasurable regions, which, in turn, leads to the failure of position observation. In order to solve the problem of combining single current sampling with position sensorless control, this article proposes the Generalized Indirect Flux detection by Online Reactance Measurement method, where the angles of injected voltage vectors can be arbitrarily assigned to minimize the negative impact of unmeasurable regions and enhance control reliability. Furthermore, the dynamic PWM modulation method is proposed, where the field-oriented control execution frequency is increased to further enhance the dynamic performance of the control system. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experiments on a 2.2-kW platform.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Two-Dimensional SVPWM and Phase Difference Boundary Analysis for Transformerless Back-to-Back Cascaded H-Bridge Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11159157</link><description>Conventional space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM) schemes for back-to-back cascaded H-bridge converters suffer from problems such as limited available sectors and the risk of capacitor short-circuit faults under phase difference conditions. To address these issues, a two-dimensional (2-D) SVPWM strategy based on bilateral voltage balancing is proposed in this article. The strategy optimizes the vector synthesis paths, expanding the boundary range of available sectors by 20% . It also ensures smooth transitions in port voltage levels, effectively reducing switching losses and voltage stress. Furthermore, the constraints between the modulation index and phase difference are clarified, providing a theoretical foundation for parameter design and stable operation.

Recent studies have shown that certain grid transformer configurations allow the full control of dc-side pole power flows by multitasking the converter-side windings to carry the required dc balancing current through a dedicated neutral line (NL). NL-based NPC converter systems offer a simpler and more cost-effective alternative to VB-based systems, but suffer from significant NL current ripple caused by the pulsewidth modulation (PWM) switching of the converter. This article addresses the issue on two fronts. First, an in-depth analysis of the NL current ripple is conducted in a dual NPC converter system. Analytical expressions are derived to characterize the harmonic distribution under both phase disposition (PD) and alternate phase opposition disposition (APOD) PWM strategies. Second, based on the analysis, an improved PD-PWM strategy incorporating triple degrees-of-freedom (PD-TDoF) is proposed for dual NPC converters, effectively reducing current ripple and significantly enhancing NL current performance compared to conventional PD-PWM. The theoretical analysis and effectiveness of the proposed PD-TDoF strategy are validated through laboratory experiments.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical DC Current Balancing Strategy for Multilevel Current-Source Converters Based on Differential-Mode Sectional Power and Dual-Redundant Vector Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192597</link><description>Unbalanced dc inductor currents in multilevel current-source converters can degrade power quality and potentially lead to overloading of individual modules or bridge arms. Traditional current balancing strategies either require extensive processing of redundant vectors or exhibit limited degrees of freedom, which increases complexity or directly affects current balancing performance. This article proposes a novel hierarchical current balancing control strategy based on the analysis of differential-mode (DM) and common-mode (CM) components of dc currents. By adjusting the component aligning with the capacitor voltage in the module current reference, the ac DM-sectional power of the module is regulated, thereby balancing the dc DM components across modules. Furthermore, by adjusting the duration allocation ratio of two distinct zero vectors within the vector sequence of the module, the dc CM components are suppressed, ensuring balanced currents in the upper and lower branches. The proposed method is easily implementable, eliminating the need for complex redundant vector management and intricate multivariable sorting, while introducing minimal additional switching frequency. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Compensation-Based 3D-SVPWM Strategy Employing Positive and Negative DC-Link Voltages Sampling for Three-Phase Four-Wire Three-Level Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11164875</link><description>Three-phase four-wire three-level (3P4W-3L) converters demonstrate broad application prospects in off-grid systems, while facing complex and variable operating conditions. Under asymmetrical loads, their dc-link neutral-point potential (NPP) exhibits fundamental-frequency oscillation proportional to the load unbalance factor. The adoption of traditional three-dimensional space vector modulation (3D-SVPWM) based on the assumption of balanced positive and negative dc-link voltages leads to substantial output errors during large-amplitude NPP oscillation, ultimately causing three-phase voltage unbalance and elevated total harmonic distortion (THD). Further theoretical analysis confirms that such errors introduce third-harmonic components in the output voltages. A compensation-based 3D-SVPWM strategy employing positive and negative dc-link voltages sampling is proposed in this article, which constructs the 3D space vector diagram based on the real-time sampling values of positive and negative dc-link voltages. Using the real-time positions of basic vectors, subsectors in the vector diagram are optimally redivided and the vector dwell times are calculated accordingly. This strategy effectively suppresses third-harmonic components in the output voltages, ensuring that the system can still output high-quality voltage waveforms even when the NPP oscillates greatly. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified through comparative experiments, showing a high balance degree and low THD of the output voltages.</description></item><item><title>On Magnetic Shielding for Axial Winding Segmented Coreless Transformers in Self-Sustained Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11168464</link><description>In this article, the magnetic field characteristics and shielding design for the axial winding segmented coreless transformer (CLT) in self-sustained converters are studied. The axial winding segmented design can reduce the volume of CLTs, and its magnetic field is constrained in a smaller space, effectively decreasing the dimensions and cost of the electromagnetic shielding enclosure. The shielding is equivalent to a passive RL circuit coupled with CLTs, and then the virtual magnetic permeability is introduced to derive the expressions for self- and mutual impedance, transformation ratio, power loss, operating frequency, and the current phase angle. The analysis results show that the self-sustained converter with CLTs can adapt to the parameter variations caused by the shielding insertion, i.e., the electrical, thermal, and structural parameter design of CLTs be separated from its shielding design. Meanwhile, in order to solve the contradiction among power density, magnetic shielding, and heat dissipation, a closed-form design method of conductive shielding with aperture array is proposed, which integrates the heat sink with the shielding to satisfy the magnetic shielding and improve the heat dissipation capability of the system. A 1.5 kW prototype is fabricated to verify the theoretical analysis. Compared with the unshielded design, the peak efficiency of the shielding design is almost the same, reaching 95.65%, but a lower hot spot of only 58.1 &#176;C and magnetic field radiation (9.28 &#956;T) below the standard limit (27 &#956;T) can be achieved.</description></item><item><title>A Stage-by-Stage Soft Start-Up Strategy for Multiple-Modes Resonant Switched Capacitor Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11159323</link><description>A safe and rapid soft start-up mechanism is critical and essential for enhancing the reliability of the resonant switched capacitor converter (ReSCC). This article proposes a soft start-up strategy for a ReSCC with two-stage resonant tanks and multiple operating modes. Based on the principle of establishing the capacitor voltage with maximum possible rate, the state trajectories of the first-stage and second-stage resonant tanks are sequentially designed within the resonant current limiting band. After that, the output voltage is built up with an optimal switching frequency. The proposed strategy is elaborated in detail under one of the operating modes. On this basis, a generalized soft start-up procedure applicable to all operating modes is designed. Furthermore, the comparison with hard start-up and the impact of component tolerances are investigated. The proposed strategy enables rapid and sequential establishment of capacitor voltages across three stages, while ensuring that there are no inrush currents or voltage spikes on components. The correctness of the proposed strategy is verified by soft starting a 48-V/100-W converter prototype under two different operating modes.</description></item><item><title>Pseudo Partial Power Processing Multilevel Modular High Gain Switched Tank Converter for Data Center Intermediate Bus Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165508</link><description>In this article, a pseudopartial power processing (P-PPP) multilevel modular high step-down gain switched tank converter (HGSTC) is proposed for data center application.

Therefore, in this article, power cycling tests (PCTs) considering moisture intrusion is conducted for the 6.5 kV IGBT modules. Whether it is conventional PCT or PCT considering moisture intrusion, its failure mode is manifested as an increase in thermal resistance with solder layer degradation. In conventional PCT, the failure mechanism of the module is chip solder aging, while for modules with moisture intrusion, the chip solder only shows slight aging, indicating that there are other factors causing the increase in module thermal resistance. Through comparison with scanning acoustic microscope, it was found that modules with moisture intrusion had uneven thickness of the system solder layers after PCT. This is because the high temperature during the PCT process increases the expansion stress of moisture, causing deformation of the system solder layer, then accelerating its ageing process. Furthermore, by comparing the transient thermal impedance (Zth) before and after moisture intrusion, it was found that the curve separated around the system solder layers inside the module.</description></item><item><title>An Interleaved Boost Converter With an Integrated Active Ripple Cancellation Filter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11099530</link><description>In this article, an interleaved boost converter with an integrated active ripple cancellation filter (IARCF) is presented, which is able to offer nearly duty-cycle-independent and switching-frequency-independent switching ripple cancellation capability. The inter-bridge positive coupling and inter-phase negative coupling of the integrated filter actively cancel the switching current ripple by generating mutual-inductance voltage to offset the switching voltage on the main inductor in a wide voltage range. An integrated magnetic core structure is proposed to implement the active filter, which is able to achieve partial flux cancellation and convert the ripple cancellation condition into adjusting the winding turn ratio, thereby making parameter matching easier. The accuracy of the theoretical analysis and the validity of the proposed converter and the magnetic core structure are verified by simulation and experimental results. Importantly, the proposed interleaving IARCF and magnetic core structure are versatile and can be readily applied to inverter and rectifier applications.</description></item><item><title>Resilient Operation for Grid-Connected Cascaded H-Bridge Multilevel Inverter Based on Neutral Offset</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11121403</link><description>In power systems increasingly dominated by renewable energy generations, cascaded H-bridge (CHB) multilevel inverters are well-suited for high-power applications. However, CHB topologies are prone to unbalanced conditions due to submodule faults. While redundant submodules are commonly employed to mitigate these issues, they lower efficiency and increase the costs and complexity of circuits. This article addresses unbalanced grid currents caused by faulty submodules in CHB inverters through a neutral point-shifting control strategy. When submodules are bypassed due to faults, all remaining submodules, across both normal and faulty phases, share the lost voltage of the bypassed submodules. The corresponding control strategy is presented in this article, constraints and source voltage stress reduction are analyzed, and the effectiveness is verified by simulation and experimental tests. The proposed method can reduce system costs and downtime, thus enhancing the resilient operation of the entire system.</description></item><item><title>Power-Transfer Performance Improvement for S-S Compensation IWPT System Based on Self-Adaptive Impedance Matching</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11097020</link><description>Power-transfer performance has always been one of the main obstacles to restrict the widespread deployment of series&#8211;series (S-S) compensation inductive wireless power transfer (IWPT) system. Thus, the main objective of this article is to improve the power-transfer performance of system, which enables it to better meet the demand of different application scenarios. First, coupling coefficient and load equivalent resistance are selected, to reveal one of the reasons why it is hard to realize high power-transfer efficiency from a hardware perspective.

However, conventional modulation strategies face challenges in simultaneously eliminating power backflow and achieving balanced output power among cascaded units. In response, this article proposes a double-tier power matching (DPM) hybrid frequency modulation strategy for a nine-level ACHB inverter with a dc-link voltage ratio of 2:1:1. In the upper tier power matching scheme, an improved staircase modulation for the high-voltage unit ensures power balance between high-voltage unit and low-voltage units by regulating the pulse width of the high-voltage unit. In the lower tier power matching scheme, a novel level-shift modulation is employed for the low-voltage units, utilizing carrier rotation with intervals of half a fundamental period to achieve power balance within a single fundamental period. Additionally, in order to prevent power backflow, the proposed strategy undergoes further optimization. This optimization also leads to a substantial reduction in both the implementation complexity of the DPM strategy and the switching losses in the inverter. Ultimately, this strategy is validated by both simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Nonlinear Automatic Power-Decoupling Control of a Differential Buck Grid-Tied DC&#8211;AC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11099551</link><description>A nonlinear automatic power-decoupling (APD) control strategy for a single-phase grid-tied differential buck dc&#8211;ac converter is proposed in this work.

Considering the long rail-type coil structure, circuits on transmitting (Tx) and receiving (Rx) sides, an equivalent model of displacement current paths is proposed for predicting the floating potential on sorting transfer vehicles in monorail IPT systems. An expression for floating potential is then derived, revealing that the placement of compensation components for Tx coil is the main factor affecting the floating potential. Based on it, we propose the novel suppression approaches through symmetrical split resonant inductors and strategic repositioning of the Tx coil compensation elements. Experimental validation is conducted using 1-kW power pick-ups with a 3-m-long Tx coil. Experimental and simulation results confirm the validity of the analysis.

Improved distance relays in the existing literature often rely on communication from the remote end or specific IBR control strategies, limiting the compatibility of these relays. This article proposes a distance protection method at the IBR side of the line. First, the sequence equivalent circuits of IBRs are treated as three unavailable boxes. Next, the proposed method combines the information within multiple the sequence networks, to accurately consider the impact of fault resistance and remote end infeed current. Finally, the unknown fault distance is analytically solved as a root of the quadratic equation. The proposed method does not have specific assumption on IBR control schemes, step-up transformer winding connections, or branches at the local bus, and can therefore work in power systems with various grid codes. Moreover, the proposed method is compatible with present phasor data acquisition systems at local terminal and does not require remote end information. Simulations, hardware experiments and field data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distance protection.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic Power Management Strategy for Cascaded Multilevel Converter With Hybrid Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11096102</link><description>A cascaded multilevel converter (CMC) with hybrid energy storage system (HESS) offers a promising solution for high-voltage and high-power hybrid dc&#8211;ac systems.

In addition, battery state-of-charge (SOC) balancing and SC energy management strategies are introduced to maintain optimal energy distribution and ensure long-term operation. The approach enhances overall system performance by fully leveraging the complementary strengths of batteries and SCs. The effectiveness of this strategy is validated through simulations and experiments, confirming its scalability and adaptability to various CMC-based HESS configurations.</description></item><item><title>Precise Sizing of Supercapacitor Packs by Accurate Prediction of Energy Using Fractional Order Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11095724</link><description>Designing a supercapacitor (SC) pack for any application involves choosing the optimum value of capacitance that meets the energy and power demands of the application. However, this is not straight forward due to the nonlinear variation of the value of capacitance with operating conditions. The conventional sizing methodology determines the capacitance value by equating the energy demand with the energy predicted using the RC model. It assumes a constant capacitance value, which results in over sizing of the SC pack. To overcome this drawback, this article proposes a fractional order (FO) model (FOM) based method to accurately predict the stored energy in SC pack. Although FOM accounts for the nonlinear capacitance variation due to the charge redistribution in the porous SC electrodes, there are certain shortcomings. First, the identification of the FOM parameters is cumbersome due to their dependence on the charge/discharge history. Second, the scaling of the FOM parameters from cell to pack level for the performance analysis of SC systems is not clearly addressed so far. Considering these, a predictor-corrector methodology for SC pack sizing is proposed. A rough estimate of the number of SC modules for meeting the specified energy and power demand is determined in the prediction stage. The correction stage evaluates the power, energy and efficiency of the selected module with FOM parameters and adjusts the sizing. The proposed methodology is then validated with a case study on a supercapacitor-based city bus, where a 27% reduction in sizing is observed.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability Analysis of Hybrid GFL-GFM System Considering Various Damping Effects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11103749</link><description>As converter-based resources keep expanding in power systems, it is urgent to clarify the transient coupling mechanisms between different control types of converters. It has already been found that both the grid-following (GFL) control and the grid-forming (GFM) control could introduce significant damping effects on transient angle motions. However, the damping effects on the relative motion between different control types of converters remain unclear, which impedes the transient stability evaluation of systems containing various converters. To fill the gap, this article explores the transient damping effects present in a hybrid system containing both the GFL and GFM converters. Two distinct damping effects introduced by the GFL and the GFM algorithms are first identified. It is found that the damping terms can introduce negative damping effects during transients, which would deteriorate the system transient stability. To quantify the damping effects, a critical trajectory approximation (CTA) method for the GFL-type damping and a damping energy approximation (DEA) method for the GFM-type damping are proposed. On this basis, a transient stability criterion for the hybrid systems is developed to directly identify the critical fault-clearing point without any repetitive iteration. Simulations and hardware-in-loop experiments are both implemented for validation. The proposed method effectively evaluates the complex damping effects and quantitatively solves the transient stability boundary for hybrid GFL-GFM systems, which may provide some valuable insights for transient stability analysis of hybrid systems.</description></item><item><title>A Carrier-Based Multiswitch Virtual Space Vector Modulation With Dead-Time Effect Elimination for Multiport DC&#8211;AC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11112519</link><description>Multiport dc&#8211;ac converter has gained attention due to its power density and low cost. However, in virtual space vector pulse width modulation (VSVPWM) where common-mode voltage (CMV) reduction and power control are considered, there are multiple switching actions in a period, which can be called multiswitch-VSVPWM (MS-VSVPWM). This leads to complex vector synthesis rules, and dead-time effect (DTE) needs to be analyzed due to variable port voltages. To simplify computation, a carrier-based MS-VSVPWM with DTE elimination is proposed. First, according to volt-second balance and dwell time relations, variable and fixed modulation waves are derived. Then, final output sequences are obtained by using phase opposition disposition (POD) carrier. Second, shifted modulation wave is derived on this basis. The drive signals are obtained by the variable/fixed modulation wave and the shifted modulation wave, respectively. Thus, DTE is eliminated on the premise of avoiding shoot-through of power switches. In addition, a variable shift value strategy is investigated to obtain the maximum shift value. Finally, the proposed method is verified experimentally on photovoltaic (PV)-battery hybrid system prototype, showing its high efficiency and relatively low output harmonics based on CMV reduction and power control.</description></item><item><title>Step-Wave AC Collection System: A More Efficient Solution for Wind and Photovoltaic Power Transmission</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11095885</link><description>The sinusoidal alternating current (ac) synchronous generator-based power system has served as the backbone of electricity generation and distribution for over a century.

The newly developed DT is based on a time-domain mathematical modelling approach. Moreover, a novel optimal equilibrium optimizer (OEO) algorithm is employed to find the values of unknown parameters of developed DT. Initially, the system&#8217;s unknown parameters are estimated under healthy operating conditions through novel OEO algorithm. As the system operates, the DT continuously monitors and updates these parameters, identifying any deviations or degradation in system components.

In parallel, cascaded-bridge converters (CBCs), such as cascaded H-bridge converters (CHBs), enjoy the advantages of modularity and expandability, thus being promising candidates in high-voltage GFMCs. Although the serial connection of submodules enables high-voltage stresses, CHB submodules fail to jointly share the current. Therefore, conventional CHBs can hardly comply with short-term overload requirements, which remain a tricky problem for GFMCs. By leveraging the parallel capacity of symmetrical half-bridge submodules, this article proposes grid-forming CBCs with parallel connectivity, which benefits from: 1) implementation of multilevel converter GFM functionality and customized grid-supportive services; 2) increased current capacity; 3) minimization of sensor usage and control complexity; and 4) GFM capability sustainment under submodule faults.

As such, the prior knowledge of line resistances is very helpful for achieving the coordinated regulation of multiple dc&#8211;dc converter-interfaced distributed generators (DGs). Nevertheless, line resistances are difficult to estimate, particularly when only local measurements are available. To fill the research gap, this article proposes a novel method to estimate line resistances by applying a disturbance to the output voltage of each DG sequentially. Notably, each DG simply measures its local output current and performs simple calculation with measured parameters. Different from existing methods, the proposed method allows impedance estimation without any additional hardware or communication link. Furthermore, the proposed method can be extended to heterogeneous systems, where DGs feature different parameters and/or line impedances. In this case, we employ a particle swarm optimization algorithm for accurate estimation. Finally, simulation and experimental results validate that the proposed method achieves an approximately 3% improvement of line resistance estimation accuracy as compared with the conventional estimation methods in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Simulation Method for High-Frequency Power Electronic Converters With Blocking Mode</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11112543</link><description>For the bridge-based high-frequency power electronic converters (BHPECs) using the Ron/Roff model, the identification of blocking mode is crucial for the real-time simulation to avoid oscillation and ensure model accuracy.

The proposed method ensures model stability by the backward Euler method and achieves decoupling between half-bridge arms. Besides, by correcting the predicted state variables at the diode status-changing time point, this method significantly reduces the computational amount compared to the existing blocking mode identification methods without iterative operations. Finally, a series load resonant (SLR) converter with 100 kHz switching frequency and an LLC resonant converter with 200 kHz switching frequency were implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA), achieving simulation time steps as low as 20 ns. Comparisons with existing methods confirm the advantages of the proposed method in terms of timing and resource consumption.</description></item><item><title>Development, Control, and Application of a Parallel-Type Hybrid-Actuated 6-$\underline{\mathrm{P}}$SS Precision Stage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11103746</link><description>Six degree-of-freedom (DOF) precision stage is crucial in optical engineering applications, which necessitates rapid velocity, submicrometer resolution, extensive workspace, and power-off self-locking functionality. Conventional multi-DOF precision stages may excel in certain motion performances while underperforming in others. This study introduces a hybrid concept of a 6-$\underline{\mathbf{P}}$SS precision stage actuated by frictional and electromagnetic forces in a parallel arrangement, with the frictional force generated by a multimode piezo-motor and the electromagnetic force produced by a voice coil motor. Unlike the conventional macro/micro precision stage, the proposed one features parallel-type actuation, avoiding some drawbacks such as complex kinematics and internal interference. The theoretical model of the system is established. A controller integrating proportion integration differentiation (PID) and sliding mode controller incorporating a disturbance compensator (SMC-DC) is developed to mitigate shock interference from the two forces, allowing the precision stage to attain optimal performance in resolution, stroke, and velocity, while also incorporating a power-off self-locking feature. The experimental setup is established to assess the feasibility of the suggested design. To further display the superiority in versatile actuation, the proposed 6-$\underline{\mathbf{P}}$SS stage is employed to align the single-mode fiber. The spatial optical coupling achieves 81% efficiency in just 32 s. The proposed methodology can be extended to further precision positioning applications.</description></item><item><title>Reinforcement Learning-Based Control for Electrohydraulic Actuators: A Case Study on an Inverted Pendulum Testbench</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11099537</link><description>Electrohydraulic actuators (EHAs) are critical in applications demanding compact designs, high power density, and precise motion control.

As a remedy, this work proposes a model predictive controller (MPC) to handle the unmeasurable backlash often encountered in dual-motor driving systems (DDSs). First, a control-oriented model with an observer is established to estimate the backlash torque. Accordingly, a constrained MPC is developed to minimize both the tracking error and vibrations. Therein, delay compensation is leveraged to decrease prediction lag. PI feedback is introduced to compensate for the steady-state error caused by the offset of the external observer. Based on the output of the proposed MPC, which is the sum of the torques for two motors, a time-varying-bias-torque (TVBT) scheme to save energy consumption is designed to compute the torque for each motor. Finally, experiments are conducted on DDSs to verify the effectiveness and superiority of the present MPC-TVBT.</description></item><item><title>Noninvasive DC Current Monitoring for High-Sensitivity With Temperature Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11099536</link><description>DC microgrids, which are being widely applied in renewable energy distribution management and enhancing energy efficiency in smart buildings, are facing significant challenges in maintaining system stability and reliability, as well as effectively managing complex communication and control. In this article, a noninvasive dc current galvanometer is proposed for high-sensitivity with temperature compensation via a differential passive sensing&#8211;wireless transmitting scheme. An integrated configuration, mainly consisting of a magnetic cantilever and a dual-frequency microstrip patch, is used to synchronously realize both sensing and transmitting. A sensitivity of 503.88 ppm/A, obtained with a fabricated prototype, 41 times greater than that of previous one, is increased to 1024.75 ppm/A by introducing an array design, achieving an improvement of two orders of magnitude.

Unlike previous studies that focused on establishing a stable source on the primary side (e.g., through a full-bridge inverter), this article leverages the load-sensitive characteristics of a single-switch resonant inverter to achieve a more stable system under varying coupling conditions. In addition, instead of designing the inverter and compensated coupler in a decoupled manner, the whole system is viewed as an ultrahigh-order resonant converter. Through simplification, the existing analytical inverter model is modified to fully explore the design potential for coupling-independent zero voltage switching and high robustness under parameter variations. The modified model also fills the gap in the holistic modeling of single switch IPT systems.

This study introduces a novel approach to address the OPGF problem by integrating problem decomposition with reinforcement learning (RL)-based cutting plane techniques. The proposed strategy divides the original OPGF problem into a simplified OPGF (SOPGF) sub-problem and a power and gas flow (PGF) calculation sub-problem. In the constraint set of the SOPGF sub-problem, linear inequality constraints (i.e., cutting planes or cuts) are introduced, bounding the feasible region of the SOPGF sub-problem and thereby obtaining the optimal solution to the original OPGF problem. The cuts are determined using an RL algorithm, and the RL agent is trained to maximize the rewards estimated by the PGF calculation. To enhance the efficiency of the agent training, action selection method is utilized in the RL-based cutting plane approach. Case studies are performed to assess the proposed strategy in comparison to conventional methods across diverse test conditions, verifying that the new approach surpasses conventional approaches in both computational efficiency and feasibility.</description></item><item><title>Modelling of AC-DC Voltage Control Coupling and Adaptive Fault Ride-Through Method for VSC-HVDC Integrated Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948156</link><description>During grid fault, the voltage source converter-based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) integrated wind farms should effectively support the grid voltage while ensuring the integrated system security. Existing studies have neglected the AC-DC voltage control coupling caused by the sudden change in the grid's complex impedance due to the fault transition impedance, which may lead to transient DC overvoltage, poor elevation of grid voltage, or active power loss of wind farms. A faulted grid equivalent model based on the virtual fault is established, and the mechanism of AC-DC voltage control coupling of the integrated system caused by the complex impedance of the faulted grid is found. A coupling model of the grid-connection bus voltage of the integrated system, maximum DC voltage deviation, and active power of the wind-end converter is established, and the quantification method for the maximum grid voltage support capability of the integrated system is proposed. Finally, the adaptive symmetrical fault ride-through method balancing between AC-DC voltage control is proposed. Through simulation verification, the proposed method can maximize the grid voltage elevation and minimize the active power loss of wind farms while avoiding DC overvoltage and the steady-state AC overcurrent of grid-end converter under the premise.</description></item><item><title>Performance-Aware Control of Modular Batteries for Fast Frequency Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947730</link><description>Modular batteries can be aggregated to deliver frequency regulation services for power grids. Although utilizing the idle capacity of battery modules is financially attractive, it remains challenging to consider the heterogeneous module-level characteristics such as dynamic operational efficiencies and battery degradation. In addition, real-time decision making within seconds is required to enable fast frequency response. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a performance-aware scheduling approach for battery modules to deliver fast frequency response (FFR) support. In particular, the conduction loss and switching loss of battery packs as well as converters are captured within a mix-integer quadratic constrained program (MIQCP). The cycle-based aging model identifies the aging cost of battery modules during frequent cycling by introducing the aging subgradient calculation and linearization. Case studies based on real-world battery data show that the proposed scheduling approach can effectively reduce power loss cost by nearly 28%&#8211;57% and battery aging cost by 4%-15% compared to conventional methods, which can also enhance the SoC balance.</description></item><item><title>Meta Reinforcement Learning Based Adaptive and Interpretable Energy Storage Control Meets Dynamic Scenarios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948374</link><description>As renewable energy becomes more widespread, energy storage systems (ESSs) play an important role in managing energy distribution and economic arbitrage. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL)-based scheduling methods face performance degradation or failure in highly dynamic environments due to their limited generalization capability, especially amid increasing fluctuations in renewable energy output, electricity prices, and load demands. This paper proposes a novel ESSs control framework based on Meta-Reinforcement Learning (Meta-RL), comprising offline training and online adaptation phases. The offline training phase features a dual-loop update framework, acquiring a model with highly generalizable initial parameters through a multi-task learning approach. In the online adaptation phase, the model can make adaptive adjustments rapidly in response to environmental changes. Lastly, a Shapley Value-based Meta-RL (SMRL) method is proposed to perform an in-depth analysis of decision-making outcomes. Multiple dynamic microgrid (MG) scenarios were simulated using real data with added fluctuation factors for model training and testing. The proposed Meta-RL based model exhibits significantly better adaptability in various scenarios, achieving approximately 20% to 50% performance improvement compared to the traditional RL model. A detailed analysis of the contribution of features behind scheduling decisions shows alignment with human intuition.</description></item><item><title>Periodic-Enhanced Informer Model for Short-Term Wind Power Forecasting Using SCADA Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955286</link><description>Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems can collect abundant information about wind farm operation and environment. To better make use of SCADA data, a periodic-enhanced informer model for short-term wind power forecasting using scada data is proposed. Firstly, to effectively filter out noise in SCADA data, a v-p curve-based method is adopted by incorporating a quartile approach to remove sparse outliers; a density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is then employed to eliminate stacked outliers from the power curve. Secondly, a multi-feature input set selection method based on Maximization Information Coefficient is introduced to make better use of the SCADA system data by reducing the number of features. Thirdly, a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) is designed to extract the scalar projection of the input set, followed by fusing the local time stamp and global time stamp to build the periodic information enhanced prediction model embedding layer. Subsequently, the enhanced input set is fed into an informer model to predict future wind power. Finally, considering the multiple temporal scales structure characteristics present in the dataset, a multi-scale deep fusion module is established in the informer model to deeply integrate the features of different scales. It can simultaneously avoid the resource waste and overfitting problems caused by increasing the network depth. The experimental results, which are obtained from several deep learning methods on real SCADA data, demonstrate that the suggested approach has good predictive capability.</description></item><item><title>Computationally Efficient Model Predictive Control for Enhanced Primary-Level Management of Standalone Microgrids With Hybrid Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955859</link><description>This paper proposes a highly efficient model predictive control (MPC) technique for primary-level control of a hybrid storage system (HSS) in a microgrid with renewables. Generally, active set (AS)-based MPCs are used to control HSS-based microgrid systems, which are computationally complex. The high-complexity prevents making control decisions within the sampling time, which negatively affects the robustness of the control system. Moreover, high complexity necessitates powerful controllers, which increase the system's overall cost and energy consumption. On the other hand, less complex controls, such as supervisory control, reduce the storage system's stability, reliability, and lifetime. The proposed method is a closed-form AS-based MPC that shares the mutual advantages of both AS-based MPC and supervisory controllers with additional robustness. It thus significantly reduces the computational complexity while being stable and reliable, improving storage lifetime, and having higher robustness compared to MPC and supervisory controllers. The proposed method is compared to modified AS based MPC, Hildreth quadratic programming (HQP), and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) based MPC recently employed for an HSS microgrid application. The analysis showed that the proposed method could significantly outperform the conventional MPC methods in computational complexity and robustness, as well as the supervisory controller in terms of reliability, stability, enhanced battery lifetime, and robustness.</description></item><item><title>Analysis of a Disturbance Event With Inverter-Based Resources Using EMT Simulations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964428</link><description>Increasing penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) necessitates newer methods of planning and analysis of disturbances. The existing phasor-domain transient stability (TS) analysis may not capture the dynamics of IBRs during fault events. In this paper, electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations using high-fidelity detailed model of power grid and one of the affected photovoltaic (PV) plants during the Angeles Forest disturbance in 2018 are performed. In these simulations, the processes to develop EMT models of power grid from traditional phasor-domain TS data and PV plant from collected data are described. Thereafter, using these simulations, the response of the PV plant during the fault event in 2018 is replicated and a sensitivity analysis is performed. The sensitivity analysis consists of making changes to the components within the PV plant and in the power grid to evaluate the impact they have on the response observed by the PV plant during the fault event. This analysis provides an understanding of the components that impact the operation of a PV plant during fault events and provide guidance to system planners on the studies that need to be performed to maintain a reliable power grid as new IBR plants are integrated.</description></item><item><title>Categorical Spatial Interpolation of Solar Irradiance for Regional Distributed Photovoltaic Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964342</link><description>High-spatial-resolution (HSR) solar irradiance forecast data is important for regional distributed photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting. Distributed PV sites are widely geographically distributed and the cost of obtaining HSR irradiance forecast data with full regional coverage is very high. Improving spatial resolution through interpolation based on limited sparse irradiance forecast reference points is a low-cost and feasible approach. However, existing irradiance spatial interpolation methods would produce large errors under variable weather conditions (e.g., cloudy) with limited reference points, because local abrupt changes in irradiance usually occur under such weather conditions due to cloud movement. This paper proposes a categorical spatial interpolation method to improve the accuracy of distributed PV power forecasting with limited sparse irradiance forecast data. The method first converts satellite-derived shortwave radiation images into binary irradiance maps through adaptive thresholding, then trains a 3D U-net model to predict future irradiance category probabilities for each grid. These probability maps dynamically govern two parallel interpolation processes: one using reference stations in predicted clear-sky regions, another utilizing stations in cloudy zones, with final irradiance values determined by probability-weighted fusion. Case studies on a real dataset verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Centralized Control for Paralleled VSCs With Grid-Forming and Oscillation Suppression Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965541</link><description>Paralleled multiple voltage source converters (VSCs) are adopted in photovoltaic (PV) or energy storage systems, and may suffer from oscillation and fault disturbance issues under various grid conditions. In this paper, a centralized control frame is proposed to suppress the active power oscillation and support the grid voltage/frequency via grid-forming (GFM) control. A virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control is applied as the centralized controller, which communicates with local controllers. The mutual damping and power angle feedback are adopted in the local controller to achieve an accurate active power sharing. The influence of key parameters such as the communication delay and mutual damping are analyzed. Finally, the proposed control is verified though the simulation and hierarchical controller-hardware-in-loop (CHIL) experiments.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Pseudo-Decentralized Control of Wave Energy Arrays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965503</link><description>In control of wave energy converter (WEC) arrays, since the dynamics of different devices are coupled by radiation effects, there has always been a dilemma between using centralized control, with optimal energy production but usually overwhelming computation, or decentralized control, with acceptable computation but performance degradation. This paper proposes a pseudo-decentralized control strategy that is effective in energy production but efficient in computation. In this method, a centralized estimation-forecasting scheme is applied to provide global information on the wave excitation force (WEF) experienced by each device. Then, the optimal unconstrained array motion is calculated from the WEF information, to serve as an initial guess of the optimal constrained motion. Finally, the constrained control moves of each WEC are optimized decentralizedly using model predictive control (MPC). However, in contrast to conventional decentralized control, each local controller not only maximizes its own energy production, but also takes into account the energy it contributes, through radiation, to other WECs, given their anticipated motion. In this way, the proposed controller enjoys the same computational simplicity as decentralized control, but is demonstrated, through comprehensive testing, to be capable of achieving performance close to the ideal centralized control across a wide range of sea states.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Energy Storage Configuration for Primary Frequency Regulation Performance Considering State of Charge Partitioning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965852</link><description>The proportion of renewable energy in the power system continues to rise, and its intermittent and uncertain output has had a certain impact on the frequency stability of the grid. Therefore, a multi-type energy storage (ES) configuration method considering State of Charge (SOC) partitioning and frequency regulation performance matching is proposed for primary frequency regulation. Firstly, the Automatic Generation Control (AGC) signal is decomposed and reconstructed using the variational mode decomposition (VMD) method. Specifically, by combining the charge and discharge characteristics of Li-ion battery and flywheel energy storage (FES), component signals of different frequencies are allocated to different ES systems. Secondly, a multi-type ES capacity allocation optimization model considering SOC partitioning is developed, with the objective function being the minimization of the whole life-cycle planning cost of ES. Finally, based on actual data from a region in North China, the proposed method is verified by analyzing case studies under different scenarios. The results demonstrate that the method can effectively reduce computation time, optimize ES operating conditions, and thus lower the whole life-cycle planning cost of ES.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Grid-Interactive Power Performance Enhancement Method for D-PMSG-Based Virtual Synchronous Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966203</link><description>Virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control is widely applied in grid-interactive inverters due to its similarity to synchronous generators. The VSG frequency variation is delayed by the synchronous swing equation to provide additional inertia support, which also leads to a slower power response. When applied to wind turbines (WTs), VSG reduces their power tracking ability, compromises the wind power capture efficiency, and affects the dispatch commands execution. The response to external frequency causes more power changes in WTs, making it difficult for wind power capture to keep up due to the mass of the rotor and blades, bring extra operational risks for WTs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hierarchical grid-interactive power performance enhancement method for D-PMSG-based virtual synchronous wind turbines (VSWTs). The power performance is enhanced by coordinating the synchronous swing equation and voltage excitation equation parameters. The grid-forming power flow and electromechanical status of the VSWT are integrated to extend the kinetic energy (KE) utilization limits to ensure the efficiency and safety of the VSWT during the KE utilization-based wind power capture regulation. The proposed method comprehensively improves the grid-interactive power performance of VSWTs, and the effectiveness has been validated through comparative simulations.</description></item><item><title>Novel Voltage Support Strategies for DGs in Hybrid AC/DC Distribution Networks Under Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10970419</link><description>According to the grid codes, the higher the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC), the longer duration that the voltage-source converters (VSC) can stay connected to the grid. In hybrid AC/DC distribution networks (HADNs), owing to the low capacity, VSC-based distributed generator (DG) closest to the fault point may fail to significantly support the voltage at the PCC through current injection. Therefore, other large-capacity converters such as flexible AC/DC converters (FACs) should also inject currents to help it. However, in resistive-inductive HADNs, the voltage support effect is related to the current phases of converters, and the fault conditions. In this paper, circumstances under two fault position categories (upstream and downstream fault positions of DG) for double line-to-ground fault and three-phase short-circuit fault are analyzed. The interconnected sequence networks of HADNs under these two fault positions are proposed. Based on the proposed networks, the optimal current phase angles of DG and FAC for maximumly supporting voltages at the PCC of the DG are proposed. Moreover, the line sequence impedance calculation method is proposed. The simulation results verify the proposed strategy. The proposed strategy is suitable for low-capacity DGs in resistive-inductive HADNs to achieve voltage support and fault ride-through.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Accelerated ADMM for Stochastic Power System Scheduling With Numerous Scenarios</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10971244</link><description>The increasing share of uncertain renewable energy sources (RES) in power systems necessitates new efficient approaches for the two-stage stochastic multi-period AC optimal power flow (St-MP-OPF) optimization. The computational complexity of St-MP-OPF, particularly with AC constraints, grows exponentially with the number of uncertainty scenarios and the time horizon. This complexity poses significant challenges for large-scale transmission systems that require numerous scenarios to capture RES stochasticities. This paper introduces a scenario-based decomposition of theSt-MP-OPF based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Additionally, this paper proposes a machine learning-accelerated ADMM approach (ADMM-ML), facilitating rapid and parallel computations of numerous scenarios with extended time horizons. Within this approach, a recurrent neural network approximates the ADMM sub-problem optimization and predicts wait-and-see decisions for uncertainty scenarios, while a master optimization determines here-and-now decisions. Additionally, we develop a hybrid approach that uses ML predictions to warm-start the ADMM algorithm, combining the computational efficiency of ML with the feasibility and optimality guarantees of optimization methods. The numerical results on the 118-bus and 1354-bus system show that the proposed ADMM-ML approach solves the St-MP-OPF with 3-4 orders of magnitude speed-ups, while the hybrid approach provides a balance between speed-ups and optimality.</description></item><item><title>Finite-Time Stabilization of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines Under Wind and Wave Disturbances by Adaptive Barrier-Function Fractional-Order Sliding Mode Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10972122</link><description>Floating offshore wind turbines harness more vigorous and more stable winds, making them a promising solution for clean energy. However, their stability is compromised by sea waves and sudden winds, reducing power extraction. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a finite-time fractional-order adaptive SMC for tension-leg platform wind turbines to enhance stability and efficiency. A fractional-order model ensures accurate system representation, while a barrier-function-based adaptive control strategy guarantees rapid, finite-time convergence, mitigates chattering, and suppresses external disturbances through real-time estimation. The proposed controller effectively stabilizes the system, helping to maximize power extraction. Simulation results in the MATLAB-Simulink environment demonstrate superior performance compared to conventional methods in terms of disturbance rejection and convergence speed. Furthermore, hardware-in-the-loop validation using a Speedgoat platform confirms the method's real-time feasibility and robustness under realistic operational conditions. The proposed approach offers a significant advancement in floating offshore wind turbines stability and control, ensuring efficient energy harvesting even under severe environmental disturbances. These findings contribute to the development of more reliable and resilient floating wind energy systems, supporting the transition toward sustainable offshore wind power.</description></item><item><title>A Distributed Dispatch of Bi-Directional Power and Hydrogen Systems for Enhancing the Renewable Energy Integration in Grid-Connected Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10977964</link><description>The accelerating transition to renewable-based power grids is critical for carbon neutrality. Centralized renewable energy deployment usually forms grid-connected microgrids with limited power exchange with the main grid for stability concerns, which results in inadequate utilization of renewable energy. With hydrogen becoming an indispensable energy component, power-to-hydrogen (P2H) technology has become increasingly prevalent for mitigating renewable energy curtailments. In this paper, we present a coordinated dispatch model for bi-directional power-hydrogen system (BDPHS) that considers the electrolyzer dynamics for hydrogen storage and hydrogen fuel cell systems. We propose an improved alternating direction method of multipliers (I-ADMM) method that uses MILP for coordinated dispatch of renewable and hydrogen systems in a distributed manner.

However, most existing methods face challenges in dealing with data scarcity and random fluctuations. This paper proposes an ultra-short-term distributed PV power forecasting method based on Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Firstly, virtual distributed PV power data is generated with different spatial resolutions. Next, the generated data is used to pre-train a Transformer-based model for predicting PV power from 15 minutes to 4 hours. Finally, the model is fine-tuned on real PV stations with a small data volume. The attention mechanism can learn correlations from lots of historical power data by pre-training. Fine-tuning can realize lightweight deployment and accurate prediction on newly built PV stations, effectively dealing with data scarcity. Models with 12.63M and 103M parameters are pre-trained using virtual data, respectively. The experimental results on datasets from 3 locations show that when there is 1 mo real data, the average RMSE decreases by 37.22%, 32.92% and 10.87% compared with the LSTM, linear model, and Transformer-based model, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Allocation and Two-Level Control of Reactive Power for Balancing Voltage and Power Factor of Renewable Energy Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980477</link><description>Renewable energy stations(RES) must satisfy voltage security and power factor requirements for safe and efficient operation. However, these requirements often conflict, posing challenges in practical applications. This paper first analyzes the constraints and identifies the boundary of RES voltage regulation capability under power factor constraints. Building on the analysis, an optimal allocation and two-level control (TLC) of reactive power is proposed. It integrates the optimization of reactive power compensator (RPC) with the coordinated control of reactive resources, thereby balancing voltage regulation and power factor. From the allocation perspective, an RPC optimization method is proposed to maximize the feasible voltage range of RES under varying active power conditions of RES. From the control perspective, a TLC scheme is proposed, combining station and unit control. At the station level, the controller features a mode-switching function and calculates the overall reactive power reference value. At the unit level, the controller coordinates the converter-interfaced generations (CIGs) and RPC. Case studies are conducted on a real RES project in Bazhou, Xinjiang, China. Matlab/Simulink and Opal-RT real-time simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method enhances both voltage security and economic efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Autonomous Voltage Regulation for Smart Distribution Network With High-Proportion PVs:A Graph Meta-Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982124</link><description>Smart distribution grids with a high percentage of distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems often face severe voltage quality problems. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) presents great potentials in achieving optimal voltage level control in distribution grids with the advantage of learning without explicit modeling. However, when DRL is applied to active voltage regulation in distribution grids with a high proportion of distributed photovoltaic (PV) power generation, it encounters several challenges, such as uneven learning among controllable devices and environmental instability, which impede the convergence of DRL. In addition, traditional reinforcement learning represents the distribution network with vectors and ignores topology information. In this paper, we transform the voltage control problem into a partially observable Markov decision process, and propose a multi-agent meta-reinforcement learning algorithm based on graph convolutional networks to improve voltage quality by combining DRL with meta-learning (ML). By integrating ML, our approach allows agents to better predict the actions of other agents, thus mitigating the instability of the environment. To address the problem of uneven learning among agents, we incorporate a self-concern mechanism and a value decomposition method into the critique network. The proposed algorithm is validated through experiments on IEEE 33-bus, 141-bus, and 322-bus systems and compared with five other multi-agent DRL methods and model-based model predictive control algorithms.</description></item><item><title>FDCA-DSTGCN: A Wind Farm Cluster Power Day-Ahead Prediction Model Based on Frequency Domain Information Gain and Dynamic Trend Sensing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982214</link><description>Accurate wind farm cluster power prediction (WFCPP) is of vital significance for new power systems with large-scale wind power integration. The current WFCPP modeling method ignores the important role of wind direction and frequency domain information, resulting in insufficient use of spatial information and difficult to improve the prediction accuracy. In order to solve the above problems, a day-ahead power prediction model for wind farm cluster power is proposed based on information gain in frequency domain and dynamic trend sensing. Firstly, a cluster division method based on graph theory and progressive fusion of multiple information is proposed, and a virtual information node is set up.

Finally, the proposed method is applied to a wind farm cluster in Inner Mongolia of China. Compared with the existing and traditional prediction methods, the normalized root mean square error of the proposed method is reduced by 1.13%&#8211;2.15%, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Assessing the Impact and Quantifying the Value of Flexibility in Transactive Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10989551</link><description>Distributed Flexibility (DF) is seen as a key tool in managing future distribution networks, but there are no comprehensive methods to quantify its value to stakeholders and impact on the network. Consequently, the potential costs and benefits of DF are uncertain, delaying the rollout of the concept onto real networks. This paper proposes a method to address that gap: a network-aware framework for modelling the interaction of DF with local and whole system markets to analyse the system performance in detail. The paper provides a set of mathematical models and algorithms to derive realistic supply and demand curves for flexibility in a distribution system, find the global equilibrium of multiple markets and services, model their impacts on networks, and perform cost-benefit analysis for stakeholders. The framework has been applied to a case study comprising a real network in England, forecast data of flexible demand and distributed generation, and the prices expected in the electricity system. The numerical study showed that DF can bring real value to all stakeholders when procured through markets; however, to maintain positive and consistent benefits to networks and stakeholders, appropriate price signals (i.e., tariffs and charges) must be designed for each network individually.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Control of Grid-Forming Wind Turbines and Grid-Forming Energy Storage Systems for Power System Restoration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002600</link><description>Grid-forming wind turbines (GFM-WTs) provide a promising solution for the restoration of wind-integrated power systems owing to their fast restart and grid support capabilities. However, individual GFM-WTs rely on external GFM sources for self-start, and their GFM support capability may be hindered by wind power shortages, potentially causing restoration failures. To address these challenges, this paper combines GFM-WTs and GFM energy storage systems (ESSs) to construct a black-start source for power system restoration. The GFM-ESS can provide self-start conditions for the GFM-WT while also improving its GFM support capability to withstand wind power shortages and load restoration transients. To ensure the stability of the restored system, a coordinated control strategy is proposed. First, a pre-synchronization control is designed to enable the GFM-WT to seamlessly connect with the GFM-ESS. Second, a power system stabilizer is developed to mitigate the power oscillation between the parallel GFM-WT and GFM-ESS. Third, to coordinate their power outputs during the load restoration, a model predictive secondary frequency control considering the stability of the WT rotor speed and system frequency is presented. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can improve the stability and security of the system restoration process under wind power shortages.</description></item><item><title>Rotor Thrust Control for Large-Scale Wind Turbine in Near-Rated Wind Speed Region</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003805</link><description>To limit the maximum rotor thrust in the near-rated wind speed region, this paper proposes a novel rotor thrust control scheme for large-scale wind turbines operating.

Based on blade element momentum theory, the rotor thrust can be identified by the blade root out-of-plane bending moments. The rotor thrust control loop is then designed with the identified rotor thrust. Then, a feedforward blade pitch saturator is designed, called Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion based minimum Pitch Saturator (NDI-PS). It is realized by nonlinear dynamic inversion of the thrust coefficient curve. The simulation results exhibit outstanding performance of the proposed control scheme. Compared with existing controllers of NREL and Goldwind, power output is increased by 1% to 1.5%, while blade root and tower bottom loads are mitigated by about 4% .</description></item><item><title>Feature-Driven Microgrid Economic Dispatch via Solar-Induced Contingent Balancing Satisficing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11005474</link><description>For the multiple energy microgrid (MEMG), this paper builds an adaptive Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity set instead of characterizing its size for solving the economic dispatch (ED) problem considering uncertain solar outputs. With the ambiguity set, an electrothermal balancing satisficing (EBS) framework is proposed by defining a solar-induced contingent electrothermal balancing risk measure (SCEB-RM) to interpret the risk level for maintaining electrothermal balance under solar uncertainty. For comprehensive contingent cost targets, a multi-objective EBS is extended to refine the solar impact on electric and thermal energy resources, respectively, and provide the corresponding out-of-sample cost bounds. Using the realized solar data, a feature-driven EBS model is formulated by incorporating soft dynamic time warping-based k-means clustering into the ambiguity. A tractable counterpart is obtained by developing a solution approach on bilateral responsive affine resource adaptation, where satisfactory targets are specified by comparing with sample robust optimization as the baseline, serving as an instance. Using real-world datasets, combinations of IEEE test systems and thermal networks validate that EBS eliminates the risky condition of uncertainty while revealing the connection between targets and solutions. It is shown that cluster-wise information makes EBS withstand greater uncertainty as effectively as the state-of-the-art in most cases and sometimes better.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Mean-Corrected Recursive Estimation-Based Optimal DER Dispatch for Distribution System Voltage Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11004617</link><description>Recent advances in smart inverters offer opportunities to mitigate adverse grid impacts caused by high penetrations of distributed photovoltaics (PV) in distribution grids, such as voltage violations.

Imposing stability constraints in scheduling models is crucial to maintaining secure operations. This paper develops a novel voltage and frequency stability constrained unit commitment (UC) model for power systems with heterogeneous regulation resources, including synchronous generators (SGs), synchronous condensers, condenser retrofitted SGs, and wind power generators with grid-following or grid-forming converters. The frequency stability constraints encompass critical metrics across the entire frequency response process, effectively capturing the unique dynamics of diverse resources. The voltage stability constraints prioritize the long-term stability of buses with low stability margins, particularly those heavily penetrated by RESs. Furthermore, the proposed model captures the inherent coupling between frequency and voltage stability, offering extensibility for broader applications. To ensure computational efficiency, nonlinear terms in the constraints are linearized using a piecewise linearization algorithm. The proposed two-stage UC model optimizes operational costs while maintaining system stability.

The proposed DDEM identifies sensitive control parameters of the DFIG wind turbines at oscillatory frequencies through the explicit expression of the system's damping loss factor (DLF). It also evaluates the damping contribution by calculating the distributed damping loss factor (DDLF) for each element or subsystem in real-time. Initially, this paper presents the DLF concept for basic vibration systems and extends it to oscillatory power systems. Subsequently, an analytical expression of the DLF in DFIG-based wind farms is derived by calculating the dissipated energy and the maximum transient energy at the sub-synchronous frequencies. The DLF is then decomposed into DDLFs according to the physical structure of the oscillatory system, facilitating the development of the DDEM to evaluate the damping contributions. The efficacy of the DDEM is demonstrated through two case studies: the modified IEEE first benchmark model on sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) and the Guyuan wind power system model in North China.</description></item><item><title>A Secure Distributed Computation of Combined Heat and Power Dispatch Based on Transformation Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008674</link><description>The widespread utilization of combined heat and power (CHP) units creates a tight couple between the power transmission system (PTS) and district heating systems (DHS). Since PTS and DHS are always managed by different operators with information security concerns, there has been a growing interest in implementing distributed solutions for combined heat and power dispatch (CHPD). However, existing distributed algorithms require an exchange of information, such as CHP output and dual multipliers, between PTS and DHS, posing a potential risk of information leakage. To address this issue, we introduce a transformation-based method to mask the CHPD model, thereby masking the real economic and physical coefficients using random nonsingular matrices. We discuss the selection principle for encryption matrices to diminish the additional computational burden caused by transformation. Then, we develop an improved Benders decomposition method by introducing valid inequalities and strengthening Benders cut to efficiently solve the masked CHPD problem in a distributed manner. The proposed secure analysis proves that the proposed method can resist two common threat models in information security, including semi-honest adversaries and external eavesdroppers. Numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Capacity Planning of Hybrid Renewable Energy - CCHP System Considering Inter Seasonal Borehole Thermal Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008841</link><description>Combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) systems are recognized for their high energy efficiency, with utilization rates exceeding 80%. However, traditional CCHP systems often rely on microgas turbines, contributing to carbon emissions. In this paper, we design a hybrid renewable energy - CCHP system, where the electric load is provided by photovoltaic and wind power, and the heating/cooling loads are supplied by converting power to heat by heat pumps. Considering the seasonal variability of renewable energy generation, we introduce borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) into the CCHP system, transforming the ground into a thermal storage that stores excess energy during summer for use in winter. We formulate the problem as a two-stage robust model with decision-dependent uncertainty. Then, we develop a customized algorithm based on Benders decomposition to effectively solve this model and discuss the algorithm improvement techniques. Our approach is validated through a case study of an actual system in Ordos, China, where the effects of BTES integration, uncertainty budget value, and varying ratios of renewable energy are analyzed.</description></item><item><title>A Quantum Annealing-Based Three-Stage Scheduling Strategy for Multi-Stack Fuel Cell Hybrid Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11014234</link><description>Fuel cell hybrid power systems (FCHPS) face significant challenges due to the non-convex nature of their optimization problems, especially in high-power applications with multi-stack configurations that involve numerous start-stop decisions, introducing a high number of binary variables. To address these issues, this paper presents a quantum annealing (QA)-based three-stage scheduling strategy for multi-stack solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC)-based fuel cell hybrid power systems (FCHPS). The proposed method decouples the decision-making process across different timescales&#8212;day-ahead, intra-day, and real-time&#8212;tailoring decisions to the dynamics of various power sources within the FCHPS. In the day-ahead stage, global predictions inform the startup and shutdown of SOFCs; in the intra-day stage, short-term predictions refine power outputs; and in the real-time stage, adjustments are made to respond to immediate operational conditions. Quantum annealing is introduced to expedite the solution of the large-scale, binary optimization problems inherent in multi-stack configurations. A OPAL-RT-based experimental platform is used to validate the proposed strategy. In addition, a comparison between the proposed method and conventional methods is conducted, indicating that the proposed QA-based approach significantly speeds up the computation process&#8212;being 49.89 times faster than the dual model (DMPC) predictive control method and 22.25 times faster than the Gurobi-based method. It also optimizes the overall operational cost, achieving a reduction in the total objective function value by approximately 10.62% compared to the Gurobi-based method, and by 14.66% compared to the DMPC method.</description></item><item><title>Statistically Feasible Joint Chance-Constrained Scheduling of Integrated Distribution Network and District Heating System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021270</link><description>This paper proposes a statistically feasible joint chance-constrained scheduling framework for integrated power distribution networks (PDN) and district heating systems (DHS).

Additionally, we introduce a novel constraint-specific uncertainty set reconstruction technique. This technique refines the uncertainty set by incorporating optimization-relevant information. It significantly reduces conservatism while ensuring system violation probability requirements. Comparative studies with state-of-the-art uncertainty optimization methods demonstrate the advantages of our approach. The proposed method improves computational efficiency by two orders of magnitude. It also achieves more cost-effective solutions than the best-performing benchmark method.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Solar Power Prediction Using Sky Image Sequences by a Residual Vision Reformer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021656</link><description>The unpredictable nature of solar power generation, largely influenced by fluctuating cloud cover, poses a challenge to the stability of renewable energy systems. Considering this, accurate forecasting of solar power can lead to better grid management and operation. With the advent of deep learning models, various models have been suggested to enhance the ultra-short-term solar power forecasting performance. Given that cloud images offer more direct and comprehensive information about cloud patterns compared to the numerical weather prediction data, analyzing cloud images allows for more precise and efficient cloud change predictions, leading to a more accurate ultra-short-term solar power forecasting. In this way, aiming to enhance the forecasting performance, in this paper, we introduce a deep learning-based model, including three main blocks. In the first block, a Multi-Stream Video Vision Transformer (MS-ViViT) model is proposed for extracting different types of spatio-temporal features from the input image sequences. The output features from the first block are input to the second block, Fused Improved Reformer (Fused I-Reformer), including three Improved Reformer (I-Reformer) models equipped with a Fused Encoder as well as a new loss function for sequence learning. Finally, an Attentive Residual Fully Connected (ARFC) model is proposed for solar power value prediction. The comparison results with 36 comparative models on six real-world datasets using seven evaluation metrics confirm the effectiveness of the proposed ultra-short-term solar power forecasting model.</description></item><item><title>Dual Agent Framework for Scheduling Networked Microgrids Using DRL to Improve Resilience</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11021619</link><description>The widely reported increase in the frequency of high impact, low probability extreme weather events pose significant challenges to the resilient operation of electric power systems. This paper explores strategies to enhance operational resilience that addresses the distribution network&#8217;s ability to adapt to changing operating conditions. We introduce a novel Dual Agent-Based framework for optimizing the scheduling of distributed energy resources (DERs) within a networked microgrid (N-MG) using the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) paradigm. This framework focuses on minimizing operational and environmental costs during normal operations while enhancing critical load supply indices (CSI) under emergency conditions. Additionally, we introduce a multi-temporal dynamic reward shaping structure along with the incorporation of an error coefficient to enhance the learning process of the agents. To appropriately manage loads during emergencies, we propose a load flexibility classification system that categorizes loads based on its criticality index. The scalability of the proposed approach is demonstrated through running multiple case-studies on a modified IEEE 123-node benchmark distribution network. Furthermore, validation of the method is provided by means of comparisons with two metaheuristic algorithms namely particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA).</description></item><item><title>Sample-Wise Graph-Based Multivariate Short-Term PV Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11024230</link><description>Reliable short-term photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting is of crucial significance for the rational dispatching of power sources and the effective control of operating costs for the power grid. However, temporal misalignment and regression accuracy imbalance of PV power data pose significant challenges to the reliability of forecast results. In this study, multivariate PV power forecasting is investigated from the perspective of forecast model samples. Firstly, the extent of misalignment of a sample is parameterized by a time-delay vector. Subsequently, the sample-wise graph is defined to relate the time-delay vector with PV power data. Then, the time-delay vector is estimated by minimizing the smoothness metric of the sample-wise graph. Finally, a sample-wise graph-based sample weighting strategy is introduced to address the issue of regression accuracy imbalance. The efficiency of the proposed PV power forecasting scheme is validated through extensive experiments on real-world datasets. Comparison experiments suggest that the proposed scheme can achieve remarkably improved short-term PV power forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Error-Based Active Disturbance Rejection Power Control for Large-Scale Wind Turbines Under Pitch Actuator Performance Degradation Failure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11027442</link><description>This study addresses the critical challenge of constant power control for large-scale wind energy conversion system under the combined effects of pitch actuator degradation and multiple disturbances. In the paper, a novel fault-tolerant control strategy based on error-based active rejection control (E-ADRC) is proposed. The approach incorporates a composite control architecture, comprising a disturbance rejection tracking loop and a fault-tolerant compensation loop. Within the tracking loop, an enhanced E-ADRC algorithm is suggested which not only retains the robustness and ease of implementation of traditional E-ADRC but also significantly improves the attenuation of low-frequency wind disturbances&#8212;the turbine&#8217;s primary disruption. The fault-tolerant compensation loop applies independent control signals, derived from pitch angle residuals, to each faulty actuator, mitigating the extra fault disturbances in rotor speed tracking dynamics. This dual-loop structure enables the turbine to restore high-stability power output after a fault. Furthermore, the fault-tolerant compensation mechanism ensures that, even in cases of part of the three actuators failure, the previously misaligned pitch angles are synchronized, effectively suppressing the detrimental aerodynamic imbalance and reducing adverse loads. The superiority of this approach in enhancing power output stability and reducing structure fatigue damage have been validated through a refined hardware-in-the-loop test.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming IBRs Under Unbalanced Grid Conditions: Challenges, Solutions, and Prospects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11027640</link><description>The penetration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into the grid is experiencing significant growth. Their control behavior during unbalanced grid conditions can impact system stability and protection. This paper evaluates the performance of prevalent grid-forming control-based IBRs (GFM-IBRs) under unbalanced grid conditions and proposes novel insights in a novel framework. First, we investigate the potential impacts of grid-forming control-based IBRs (GFM-IBRs) on system dynamics, protection, and fault ride-through (FRT) capability under unbalanced grid conditions based on extensive literature review and through EMT simulations in benchmark systems with IBRs. To discover these impacts and accommodate unbalanced grid conditions, we implement a generic control structure for full converter-based GFM-IBRs under FRT mode, then perform a comparative analysis of existing solutions that include sequence decomposition methods, positive sequence current-limiting methods, negative sequence controls, and current coordination methods, to identify their capabilities and limitations through literature review and EMT simulations in a large-scale power system. Finally, key challenges and solutions are discussed, highlighting prospects for future research.</description></item><item><title>Probability Density Function Control of Frequency Fluctuations in Renewable-Rich Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029151</link><description>The stochastic nature of renewable energy sources (RESs) necessitates treating power system frequency response as a random process with a nonstationary probability density function (PDF). Based upon the stochastic distribution control theory originated by the second author, this paper proposes a novel stochastic controller to improve the frequency PDF in power grids when integrating a large amount of RESs, thereby minimizing the effects of uncertainties and enhancing overall system stability. The key idea is to manipulate the controllable power generation resources so that the frequency PDF is make to follow a target PDF by using the stochastic distribution control theory originated by the second author. The proposed method can easily be plugged into existing automatic generation controls for multi-area transmission grids. The proposed method is validated via a modified Kundar&#8217;s two area system and 240-bus Western Electricity Coordinating Council systems. The simulation results show that the proposed control shapes the frequency PDF narrower and sharper, leading to a notable improvement toward minimizing the effects of randomness and uncertainty during grid operation.</description></item><item><title>Collaborative Operation of Renewable Energy Hydrogen Production Systems Considering Balanced Utilization and Extended Lifespan of Multi-Electrolyzers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029129</link><description>To address the challenges of low efficiency, poor economic performance, and limited adaptability in renewable energy&#8211;coupled alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) systems, this study proposes a power&#8211;state rolling optimization strategy (PSROS) based on a two-stage optimization framework. First, the large-scale AWE system is divided into multiple modules to reduce the variable dimension of the optimization problem. Then, a simplified module-level optimal efficiency model is developed based on the efficiency characteristics of AWE units. Subsequently, multi-objective optimization models are constructed at the module and unit levels, comprehensively considering hydrogen production volume, lifespan degradation, and utilization balancing. Finally, a finite-horizon rolling optimization mechanism is introduced to solve the two-stage optimization problem, improving the continuity and rationality of scheduling decisions at the end of each optimization horizon. Annual case study results demonstrate that, under the non-battery scenario, PSROS improves system efficiency by 9.92%, 11.12%, and 3.81%, and reduces the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) by 4.14, 5.43, and 2.35 CNY/kg compared with the simple start-stop strategy (SSSS), array rotation strategy (ARS), and rolling optimization strategy (ROS), respectively. With battery integration, the system efficiency is further improved by 0.77%, and the LCOH is further reduced by 0.49 CNY/kg.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Scheduling of Integrated Electric-Hydrogen-Thermal Systems Considering Hydroelectric Power Plant Peaking for Hydrogen Vessel Navigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11030854</link><description>Transporting hydrogen by vessels may be more cost-effective than hydrogen trailers and hydrogen tankers, but it is also more sensitive to environmental factors (e.g., river levels). In order to capitalize on the advantages of based-vessel waterway hydrogen chains, a new short-term scheduling strategy of integrated electric-hydrogen-Thermal systems considering the hydroelectric power plant peaking for hydrogen vessel (HV) navigation is proposed in this paper. First, a temporal-spatial operational model of waterway hydrogen chains is developed. In this model, the relationship between the electrolysis temperature, hydrogen production efficiency, and maximum available operational power of the reversible solid oxide fuel cell (RSOC) is modelled. The impact of the hydroelectric power plant underflow on HV transfer is also evaluated. On this basis, a flexible multi-day collaborative scheduling strategy of the electric-hydrogen integrated system is designed, where the main power source, i.e., thermoelectric plant (TEP), is allowed to operate in pure power generation mode or cogeneration mode to release the operation flexibility. This scheduling model is first linearized as a mixed-integer second-order conic programming (MISOCP) problem and then solved efficiently through a two-layer method. Finally, case studies on a modified IEEE 118-node power system verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Region of Attraction Estimation for Power Systems With Multiple Integrated DFIG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11031118</link><description>The lack of suitable modeling methods for power systems with multiple doubly-fed induction generator-based wind turbines (DFIGWTs) integrated has left the analytical description of the boundary of the region of attraction (ROA) of such systems largely unexplored. To address this gap, this paper derives an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model for a power system with multiple DFIGWTs integrated. The proposed electromechanical model is validated in a single-machine-infinite-bus (SMIB) power system and a modified 3 machine 9 bus power system with root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of less than 9.5% for trajectory comparisons with the full model, demonstrating that it accurately captures the low-frequency dynamics of the full DFIGWT model. Subsequently, the ODE model is transformed into a polynomial differential-algebraic equation (DAE) model using a nonlinear coordinate transformation. To estimate the ROA, an enhanced expanding interior algorithm (EIA) based on sum of squares (SOS) programming is applied. The feasibility of the proposed model, along with the appropriate conservativeness of the improved EIA, is validated using two test systems that include multiple DFIGWTs and synchronous generators (SGs). By comparison, it is found that the time cost of the improved EIA is reduced by around 17% while maintaining the accuracy. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach has significant practical implications for the integration of wind farms into power systems, and offers an efficient tool for transient stability analysis.</description></item><item><title>Extreme Probabilistic Solar Power Prediction via Localized Sample Structure Recognition and Generalized Error Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11033220</link><description>The fluctuations and uncertainty of solar power constantly threaten the secure operation and economic dispatch of power systems. Existing end-to-end point or probabilistic solar power prediction methods mostly lack effective integration of the two approaches, and the latent error caused by machine learning (ML) techniques is rarely taken into consideration. Hence in this paper, a combined extreme probabilistic solar power prediction (EPSPP) scheme is proposed, by integrating point forecasting with extreme error estimation. Firstly, the localized sample structure recognition (LSSR) is conducted to determine the neighborhood of meteorological conditions, where feature weights of Euclidean distance measurement are allocated with respect to the valid mutual information (MI) derived by two-dimensional diffusion kernel density estimation (2D-DKDE). Secondly, with the neighborhood generated by LSSR, an improved localized generalization error estimation (ILGEE) algorithm is put forward to infer the real-time maximal second-order origin moment of solar power point forecasting error corresponding to designated confidence levels. Finally, the solar power at each temporal moment is deduced as distinct Gaussian distributions, by modifying the mean value and variance according to statistical principles. For the sake of the so-called &#8220;extreme&#8221;, the proposed scheme could maintain reliability even under circumstances of the worst ML model precision. Cases from a real-world solar power station in Oregon, USA, are used to validate its effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>A Mechanism-Based Convex Model of Fuel Cell Systems Considering the Effect of Auxiliary System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10976439</link><description>Fuel cell systems (FCS) are recognized as promising electric sources of power systems. However, existing FCS models are either nonconvex or inaccurate when the FCS is under heavy load. This letter proposes a mechanism-based FCS feasible operational area (FCSFOA) model, taking into account the decline in fuel cell efficiency and the dynamic power consumption of the auxiliary system. Therefore, the FCSFOA model is accurate both under light load and heavy load, and the average error is only 5.4% compared with the actual data. In contrast, the FCS linear model, the most commonly used in the dispatch of power systems, has an average error of 24.4% . Besides, the FCSFOA model is also convex, which is favorable for the dispatch of power systems.</description></item><item><title>Mutual Information-Enhanced NARX-NN Digital Twins for Power Electronics in Smart Grid Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131160</link><description>This paper presents a systematic and innovative data&#8211;driven framework for constructing Mutual Information&#8211;enhanced NARX&#8211;NN Digital Twins (DTs) of power electronic converters, demonstrated on a DC&#8211;DC boost converter in continuous conduction mode under closed&#8211;loop voltage control. A Digital Twin Instance (DTI) of the inductance current is built via time&#8211;delay embedding of hidden dynamic attractors. Sampling frequency is optimized using self&#8211;Mutual Average Information (sMAI) to capture intra&#8211;cycle Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) dynamics. Input preselection uses correlation analysis and Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), followed by delay assignment via sMAI and cross-MAI (cMAI). The False Nearest Neighbours (FNN) criterion determines the minimal embedding dimension. Two NARX&#8211;NN configurations (4D and 5D) are trained on a high&#8211;fidelity MATLAB&#8211;SIMULINK model including parasitics, filtering, and non&#8211;idealities. Although thermal and voltage variations are excluded to isolate modelling effects, the 5D model outperforms the 4D under both nominal and perturbed loads. In the frequency domain (up to 50 kHz), it improves amplitude tracking. Experimental validation via offline transfer learning reduces steady&#8211;state error to approximately  $\pm \,1\%$  and transient errors to a few percent, peaking at -13% in unseen saturation case. The resulting DTIs are lightweight (&lt;1 GFLOPS), delay-aware, and interpretable, enabling scalable real&#8211;time integration into converter&#8211;centric smart grid digital twin architectures without solving differential equations.</description></item><item><title>RoCoF and Nadir of Frequency Optimization Control for Cluster-Oriented Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142799</link><description>The cluster-oriented microgrids can better manage large-scale renewable energy integration systems compared to individual microgrids, the operation control of microgrid clusters (MGCs) under disturbances still face numerous challenges. Apart from the mainstream steady-state requirements, the transient performances of nadir of frequency (NoF) and the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) exhibit more practical significance. To this end, this paper proposes a multi-index optimization approach to provide an optimal control-design solution for MGCs, enhancing the system robustness and security. Firstly, steady-state stability conditions directly related to two-layer cooperative (TLC) control parameters are derived using a quasi-invariance property. Secondly, the control parameter related sufficient conditions to guarantee the NoF and RoCoF transient performance indexes are analyzed and formulated through a matrix inequality. Lastly, a multi-index objective function is designed to integrate all these conditions, yielding optimal control parameters that make all constraints hold. Real-time simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Secondary Control for DC Microgrids With Near-Infinite Constant Power Load Accommodation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151627</link><description>In DC microgrids, constant power loads (CPLs) inherently exhibit negative impedance characteristics, which are widely believed to degrade system stability as their penetration level increases. Consequently, extensive research has aimed to establish safe upper bounds for CPL penetration. However, these upper bounds are typically derived as sufficient conditions, making them overly conservative. Moreover, when multiple DC sources are connected in parallel to a common DC bus, the simultaneous need for current sharing and DC bus voltage regulation further complicates system control. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel distributed secondary control method based on the dynamic averaging of virtual voltage drops (VVDs). The proposed method offers two key advantages: 1) It ensures both precise current sharing and voltage regulation in single-bus DC microgrids, even in the presence of mixed ZIP loads, i.e., constant resistive loads (Z), constant current loads (I), and constant power loads (P). 2) Unlike existing approaches that impose conservative limits on CPL penetration, the proposed method theoretically demonstrates that the safe upper bound for CPLs can be arbitrarily large, enabling the DC microgrid to accommodate an almost infinite number of CPLs without compromising stability. Both Simulation and experiment studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Safety-Guaranteed Voltage Regulation of Distribution Networks Using a Learning-Assisted Switching Tube Model Predictive Control Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11124582</link><description>This article proposes a learning-assisted switching tube model predictive control (S-TMPC) approach to achieve absolutely safety-guaranteed voltage regulation in distribution networks (DNs). In order to model time-varying operation modes, the switching dynamics have been introduced based on respective equilibrium points in DNs. Then, to quantify the safe operation region of each mode, an active learning algorithm with a reliable oracle is developed to estimate the safety-guaranteed reachable set, which simplifies the conventionally linear-matrix-inequalities-based (LMI-based) computation. Next, considering power disturbances of renewable energy generation, a tube model predictive control approach for safe voltage regulation is introduced, and its exponential stability condition is given. Once the voltage deviation exceeds the boundary of the operation mode, a learning-assisted switching mechanism, of which the switching action is enabled by admissible minimum dwell-time analysis of switches among safe reachable sets (i.e., pre-learned tubes) is developed to absolutely ensure a safe voltage regulation. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed voltage regulation method is verified by representative simulations and experiment tests.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Imitation&#8211;Reinforcement Learning Framework for Optimal Operation of Soft Open Points in Unbalanced Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131604</link><description>This paper proposes a hybrid actor-critic framework for the optimal operation of a phase-changing soft open point (PCSOP) in an unbalanced distribution network.

In this context, this article proposes a novel weather routing based operation approach for a multi-energy ship microgrid (MESM), which not only coordinates the heterogeneous onboard energy flows (e.g., electricity, thermal energy, green hydrogen, and freshwater) while also optimizing voyage route and speed based on dynamic weather conditions. In particular, a detailed weather-based route selection model and a weather-dependent propulsion load model are formulated, accounting for key environmental factors such as wind, waves, and drifting ice. To mitigate the risk against the uncertainties in environmental factors and cold ironing prices, a risk-averse two-stage stochastic programming integrated with a rolling horizon method is employed. In model solving, a tailored progressive hedging (TPH) algorithm is developed to enhance computational efficiency.

Nonetheless, diverse available time intervals for DRs impose substantial computational burdens for aggregation and may lead to infeasible dispatch after disaggregation. This work proposes an efficient reduction method for aggregating DRs with diverse time intervals and demand requirements while ensuring feasible dispatch. The method determines how to reduce the time interval ranges of all DRs to alleviate dispatch complexity. We reformulate an equivalent ILP problem with an available time interval matrix to reduce the problem scale. To further alleviate the computational burden, a fast approximation algorithm that combines interval clustering and weight selection is designed for large-scale DR aggregation. Numerical tests show that the proposed method maintains larger aggregated feasible regions to provide more flexibility than other inner-approximation methods, while maintaining feasible dispatch. Overall, the reformulated problem and fast approximation algorithm effectively reduce the computational time with a limited reduction in dispatch optimality.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Enabled Adaptive Power Capping Scheme for Cloud Data Centers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123584</link><description>The rapid growth of the digital economy and artificial intelligence has transformed cloud data centers into essential infrastructure with substantial energy consumption and carbon emission, necessitating effective energy management. However, existing methods face challenges such as incomplete information, uncertain parameters, and dynamic environments, which hinder their real-world implementation. This paper proposes an adaptive power capping framework tailored to cloud data centers. By dynamically setting the energy consumption upper bound, the power load of data centers can be reshaped to align with the electricity price or other market signals. To this end, we formulate the power capping problem as a partially observable Markov decision process. Subsequently, we develop an uncertainty-aware model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) method to perceive the cloud data center operational environment and optimize power-capping decisions. By incorporating a two-stage uncertainty-aware optimization algorithm into the MBRL, we improve its adaptability to the ever-changing environment. Additionally, we derive the optimality gap of the proposed scheme under finite iterations, ensuring effective decisions under complex and uncertain scenarios. The numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method using a cloud data center operational environment simulator built on real-world production traces from Alibaba, which demonstrates its potential as an efficient energy management solution for cloud data centers.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Economic Dispatch in Microgrids via Robust Gradient-Tracking Over Directed Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126159</link><description>Existing differentially private optimization algorithms for the distributed economic dispatch problem (EDP) often involve a trade-off between privacy performance and optimization accuracy. This paper presents a robust gradient-tracking based differentially private distributed algorithm to enhance both privacy performance and optimization accuracy for EDP. In particular, we employ solely row stochastic weight matrices to enable each agent to locally allocate weights to received messages. Moreover, unlike most existing approaches that rely on decaying noise, our algorithm integrates persistent noise into the exchanged information to enhance privacy performance. To mitigate the impact of persistent noise, we incorporate robust gradient-tracking techniques and introduce noise attenuation factors. By carefully selecting the step size and noise attenuation factors, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves almost sure convergence while simultaneously ensuring  $\epsilon $ -differential privacy. Finally, simulation experiments conducted on the modified IEEE 14-bus microgrid system and IEEE 118-bus power system validate the effectiveness of our algorithm in terms of both convergence and privacy performance.</description></item><item><title>End-to-End Stochastic Predict-Then-Optimize for Cost-Efficient Water-Energy Resource Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142824</link><description>Compared to other energy-intensive industries, urban water supply systems are unique due to the strong temporal coupling with the power grid, which intensifies grid stress during peak hours. This paper addresses the water-energy nexus by developing a water-energy resource scheduling model for whole-process water supply that incorporates electricity cost prediction uncertainties. Meanwhile, to minimize the scheduling cost in an end-to-end approach, we propose the Stochastic Predict-then-Optimize (SPTO), which aligns prediction distribution with the optimality gap by integrating probabilistic forecasting with stochastic optimization. Unlike traditional two-stage approaches, SPTO establishes a closed-loop feedback between forecasting and optimization, reducing cumulative errors and improving real-time adaptability. To enable end-to-end training, we derive the SPTO+, a differentiable convex upper-bound surrogate function based on Lagrangian duality, which provides surrogate gradient computation for end-to-end training. Experiments on real-world systems demonstrate that SPTO significantly reduces operational cost and decision regret, effectively coordinating water operations with dynamic grid conditions to support cost-efficient and grid-responsive scheduling.</description></item><item><title>Disaggregating Distributed PV Power From Aggregate Measurements in Transmission Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11135456</link><description>The growing integration of Photovoltaic (PV) systems into distribution networks has limited visibility for system operators, as the power output of low-power PV systems is not typically monitored. The study presented in this paper introduces a novel approach for disaggregating PV generation from net-load measurements recorded at the transmission system level. The proposed technique is applied to actual data from an existing transmission line feeder to identify PV generation from net demand measurements. The developed methodology incorporates Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for detecting PV panels based on an algorithm that provides an accurate estimate of solar PV capacity. These estimations are validated against actual data from a local utility, showing a close match between the two. This information is then utilized in reliable software tools to simulate PV power generation in the studied region, which is then used to estimate and disaggregate the generated power from net-load data by applying multiple Machine Learning and Deep Learning models. The results demonstrate that, with the proposed approach, it is feasible to adequately disaggregate PV power generation from transmission feeder net-load measurements with minimal or no additional sensor infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Energy Management Strategy for Distribution Network With Distributed Renewable Based on Learning-Driven Model Predictive Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11130449</link><description>This paper investigates the energy management of distribution network with distributed renewable.

A battery energy storage system (BESS) is commonly used to manage these demand charges. Economic model predictive control (EMPC) with a reference trajectory can be used to dispatch the BESS to optimize the microgrid operating cost. Since demand charges are incurred monthly, EMPC requires a full-month reference trajectory for asymptotic stability guarantees that result in optimal operating costs. However, a full-month reference trajectory is unrealistic from a renewable generation forecast perspective. Therefore, to construct a practical EMPC with a reference trajectory, an EMPC formulation considering both non-coincident demand and on-peak demand charges is designed in this work for 24 to 48 h prediction horizons. The corresponding reference trajectory is computed at each EMPC step by solving an optimal control problem over 24 to 48 h reference (trajectory) horizon. Furthermore, BESS state of charge regulation constraints are incorporated to guarantee the BESS energy level in the long term. Multiple reference and prediction horizon lengths are compared for both shrinking and rolling horizons with real-world data. The proposed EMPC with 48 hour rolling reference and prediction horizons outperforms the traditional EMPC benchmark with a 2% reduction in the annual cost, proving its economic benefits.</description></item><item><title>Two-Tier Aggregation of Distributed Energy Storage Units Considering Network Access Purchase</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131318</link><description>The number of distributed energy storage units (ESUs) within a distribution network is expected to increase because of the rapid deployment of 5G base stations, and they can be aggregated and formulated into a bid model of polytopic shape, which is consistent with market rules. However, it is challenging to design such a polytope that best captures their aggregate flexibility and satisfies distribution network constraints. This paper proposes a two-tier inner approximation aggregation model that aggregates the flexibility of ESUs first to the corresponding network buses and then to the substation. The uncertain power load of the 5G base station affects the minimum reserved energy of its backup battery. Therefore, with the aid of distributionally robust chance-constrained programming, a customized affine transformation-based method for inner approximation of the flexibility set is proposed to capture the charge/discharge logic and to handle uncertainty. In addition, the acquisition of network access limits is integrated into the optimal flexibility design of the aggregator by deriving the approximate form of the cost function in an auction framework. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of economy and uncertainty handling.</description></item><item><title>Cybersecurity by Design for Resilient Voltage Regulation in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131258</link><description>The transition to smart grids is advancing through the integration of grid-connected devices such as distributed energy resource (DER) inverters, distribution static synchronous compensators (D-STATCOMs), and electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, all of which play a vital role in voltage regulation within active distribution networks (DNs). Yet, these devices face growing exposure to cyber threats. This paper proposes a cybersecurity framework embedded directly within their control systems to address these risks by design. Drawing on the widespread deployment of distribution phasor measurement units (D-PMUs) for voltage monitoring, the framework incorporates a digital twin for real-time assessment, supported by data fidelity tests. This approach enables the timely detection and mitigation of false-data injection (FDI) and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, preserving voltage stability without requiring hardware modifications. Simulations on the IEEE 33-node test feeder confirm the framework&#8217;s effectiveness in strengthening the resilience and security of grid-connected systems, representing a meaningful step forward in the protection of smart grids.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Analysis of Virtual Power Plants for Peak-Regulation Service Using Phased Mission System Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11133693</link><description>This paper proposes a reliability analysis method of virtual power plants (VPPs) for peak-regulation service by adopting the phased mission system (PMS) framework. Firstly, the PMS framework of VPP for peak regulation service is established by modeling it as a multi-phased mission, decomposed into several tasks including receiving, assigning, and executing the peak-regulation instructions. Besides, the single-phased binary decision diagram (BDD) model is proposed to evaluate the VPP&#8217;s performance of single-phased mission with the consideration of prime and auxiliary approaches for different tasks. Moreover, the whole-phased BDD model is proposed to analyze the VPP&#8217;s reliability for peak-regulation service by integrating the single-phased BDD model. Next, two reliability indices of VPP towards peak-regulation services are novelly proposed to represent the success rate and the insufficiency of peak-regulation service. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through extensive numerical tests on a verified IEEE test system.</description></item><item><title>Quantum Optimization for Optimal Power Flow: CVQLS-Augmented Interior Point Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11137411</link><description>This paper presents a quantum-enhanced optimization approach for solving optimal power flow (OPF) by integrating the interior point method (IPM) with a coherent variational quantum linear solver (CVQLS). The objective is to explore the applicability of quantum computing to power systems optimization and address the associated challenges. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art quantum linear solvers&#8212;Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL), variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), and CVQLS&#8212;revealed that CVQLS is most suitable for OPF due to its stability with ill-conditioned matrices, such as the Hessian in IPM. To ensure high-quality solutions, prevent suboptimal convergence, and avoid the barren plateau problem, we propose a quantum circuit parameter initialization technique along with a method to guide the IPM along the central path. Moreover, we design an ansatz tailored for OPF, optimizing the expressibility and trainability of the quantum circuit to ensure efficient convergence and robustness in solving quantum OPF. Various optimizers are also tested for quantum circuit parameter optimization to select the best one. We evaluate our approaches on multiple systems to show their effectiveness in providing reliable OPF solutions. Simulations for the 2-bus system are conducted on a commercial IBMQ quantum device, while simulations for the other larger cases are performed using the IBM quantum simulator. While promising, CVQLS is limited by current quantum hardware, especially for larger systems. We use a quantum noise simulator to test scalability.</description></item><item><title>Aggregation of Heterogeneous DERs by the Subgradient Vertex Search Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11141502</link><description>The exploitation of distributed energy resources (DERs) is essential for the advancement of smart grids. However, the heterogeneity and scale of DERs pose major challenges to their aggregation, which is necessary to maximize their potential. This study adopts a linearized model that integrates a diverse array of DERs including power generation, energy storage, and flexible loads with varying dissipation rates. We used the model to analyze the compact form and mathematical implications of aggregation, for which we propose the subgradient vertex search method to solve. This method efficiently identifies vertices of the aggregate feasible region, which are used to construct its convex hull. Unlike traditional hyperplane-based methods, this method not only provides an inner approximation efficiently but also can converge to the exact solution. Numerical simulations validated its accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, we introduce an energy flowchart to visualize high-dimensional space of energy change processes and provide a case study involving two vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging piles to explain the mechanism of feasible region scaling, demonstrating the practical significance of precise aggregation.</description></item><item><title>Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning for Resilient Self-Proactive Distribution Grids Against Wildfires</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142361</link><description>With the growing risks and frequency of wildfires, power distribution systems (PDS) face significant challenges in maintaining reliability and security. Existing literature primarily focuses on post-event service restoration using stochastic optimization methods. Nevertheless, such approaches fall short in managing the dynamic and uncertain nature of wildfires, particularly when it comes to taking proactive measures to mitigate power outages. To address this problem, this paper introduces a wildfire smart resilience controller (WF-SRC) that utilizes a model-assisted safe Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) mechanism to reduce the impacts of wildfire-induced disruptions. The WF-SRC continuously monitors and analyzes both the status of the PDS and the spatiotemporal dynamics of wildfires, then executes preemptive actions to prevent wildfires from compromising distribution lines. These actions include optimally dispatching stationary and mobile distributed energy resources (DERs) that operate under a master-slave control scheme. While recent works assume full observability and formulate the PDS resilience problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), this approach leads to an impractically large state space and limited realism. In contrast, our approach models the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). This explicitly captures real-world sensing limitations, such as noisy measurements that arise during extreme events. The POMDP is tackled using an LSTM-TD3 DRL agent, enabling effective sequential decision-making in environments with incomplete information. Using real-world data from Alberta wildfires, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution in reducing wildfire impact, optimizing energy distribution, and enhancing robustness to uncertainties, ultimately contributing to a more resilient and proactive power grid.</description></item><item><title>Synergising Hierarchical Data Centers and Power Networks: A Privacy-Preserving Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142335</link><description>In the era of digitization, data centers have emerged as integral contributors sustaining our interlinked world, bearing responsibility for an increasing proportion of the world&#8217;s energy consumption. To facilitate the their fast rollout while progressing towards net-zero energy systems, the synergy of hierarchical data centers (cloud-fog-edge) and power networks can play a pivotal role. However, existing centralized co-dispatch manners encroach on the privacy of different agents within the integrated systems, meanwhile suffering from the combinatorial explosion. In this research, we propose a near-optimal distributed privacy-preserving approach to solve the non-convex synergy (day-ahead co-dispatch) problem. The synergy problem is formulated as a mixed integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming considering both communication and energy conservation, where Lyapunov optimization is introduced to balance operating costs and uncertain communication delays. To mitigate impacts of the highly non-convex nature, the normalized multi-parametric disaggregation technique is leveraged to reformulate the problem into a mixed integer non-linear programming. To further overcome non-smoothness of the reformulated problem, the customized  $\ell _{1}-$ surrogate Lagrangian relaxation method with convergence guarantees is proposed to solve the problem in a distributed privacy-preserving manner. The effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed methodologies for the synergy problem are validated via numerical simulations. The results also indicate that computing tasks can be migrated within the hierarchical data centers, demonstrating the flexible resource allocation capabilities of the hierarchical architecture, further facilitating peak load balancing in the power network.</description></item><item><title>Performance-Integrated Virtual Power Plant Management in the Frequency Regulation Market</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11146637</link><description>Renewable integration in power systems causes a surge of frequency fluctuations, primarily due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy. To address this challenge, distributed energy resources (DERs) pave one promising way for frequency regulation by their aggregation as a virtual power plant (VPP). For a VPP participating in the frequency regulation market, its regulation performance is critical for interaction with the system operator. This paper explores a performance-integrated management scheme for a VPP to optimize the utilization of heterogeneous DERs in the frequency regulation market. The relationship between the regulation performance and the DER reserve portfolio is first revealed through a data-driven method, which has rarely been studied in current work. This facilitates the integration of the mapped frequency regulation performance into the aggregation and disaggregation processes in the VPP management. Furthermore, in the aggregation process, the VPP&#8217;s feasible operation region associated with the high-dimensional variables and constraints is characterized through a cluster-based aggregation method. Given the massive heterogeneous DERs, this proposed method ensures satisfactory accuracy within the reduced computation time by efficiently capturing the representative DER characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is verified using real-world DER data from the Dataport database.</description></item><item><title>Assessment, Cause Localization, and Mitigation for Small-Signal Stability Risks in Multi-Parallel Grid-Forming Converter Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151621</link><description>This article addresses small-signal stability issues for multi-parallel grid-forming converter systems based on a newly developed extended passivity theory.

The objective is to unify and simplify the tasks for (i) clustering visualisation, (ii) outlier detection and (iii) generative profile modelling under one concept. The lower dimensional projection of standardised MV load profiles unveils a latent distribution in a three-dimensional sphere. This spherical structure allows us to detect outliers by fitting probability distribution models in the spherical coordinate system, identifying measurements that deviate from the spherical shape. The same latent distribution exhibits an arc shape, suggesting an underlying order among load profiles. We develop a principal curve technique to uncover this order based on similarity, offering new advantages over conventional clustering techniques. This finding reveals that energy consumption in a wide region can be seen as a continuously changing process. Furthermore, we combined the principal curve with a von Mises-Fisher distribution to create a model capable of generating profiles with continuous mixtures between clusters. The presence of the spherical distribution is validated with data from four municipalities in the Netherlands. The uncovered spherical structure implies the possibility of employing new mathematical tools from directional statistics and differential geometry for load profile modelling.</description></item><item><title>Power-SAM: An Advanced Abnormality Change Detection Algorithm for Intelligent Monitoring in Power Equipment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126170</link><description>Timely detection and management of abnormalities are critical to ensuring the safe and stable operation of the smart grid. To address this, a novel abnormal change detection (ACD) model, termed Power-SAM, is proposed for smart grids based on Artificial Intelligence. Firstly, integrate the strong generalization capabilities and efficient image segmentation performance of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) while employing fine-tuning strategies to enhance its applicability for processing images in power scenarios. Secondly, the Time Difference Feature Generator (TDFG) was designed to generate feature vectors suitable for ACD, allowing SAM to adapt to power ACD tasks. Thirdly, a feature fusion network, which combined feature aggregation with differential computation, was adopted, enhancing the model&#8217;s ability to detect subtle changes in power scenes. Lastly, CBAM-FPN by integrating Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and lightweight Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) was introduced to Power-SAM, improving ACD performance for multiscale targets. An image dataset for substation change detection was constructed from real-world power scenarios and ACD requirements. This dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed Power-SAM model. The results demonstrate that the algorithm achieves precision, recall, F1-score, and IoU metrics of 95.25%, 93.35%, 94.41%, and 89.41%, respectively, outperforming current state-of-the-art artificial intelligence models.</description></item><item><title>Prediction of Charging Station Load Uncertainty Based on Multi-Dimensional Quantile Spatial-Temporal Traffic Flow Forecast</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119652</link><description>The uncertainty prediction of electric vehicle charging station load plays a crucial role in ensuring the stable operation of power grids. In this paper, a charging station load uncertainty prediction method based on multi-dimensional quantile spatial-temporal traffic flow forecast is proposed. First, considering the complex spatial-temporal correlation characteristics of traffic flow, a traffic flow forecast model based on multi-dimensional spatial-temporal graph convolutional network is designed. The model can deeply explore spatial-temporal correlation characteristics and effectively capture both the static spatial correlations with fixed topological structures and the dynamic spatial correlations of real-time traffic flow. Second, taking into account the importance of prediction results under different confidence levels, this paper combines the forecast model with a weighted quantile regression model and introduces a novel weighted loss function, which can achieve traffic flow uncertainty prediction without the need to predefine the uncertainty probability density distribution and meet the differentiated requirements for uncertainty prediction in grid operation and business decision-making. Furthermore, considering the influence of factors such as road congestion and electricity prices on charging load, a charging station load uncertainty prediction model based on an enhanced queuing model is proposed, which can more accurately convert traffic flow uncertainty into load uncertainty, and thus more accurately simulate the charging station loads. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Accelerated Distributed Economic Dispatch in Vehicle-to-Grid Integrated Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119663</link><description>Next-generation smart grids require decentralized optimization frameworks to coordinate diverse energy assets, including renewables, dispatchable generators, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G)-enabled electric vehicles (EVs). A critical challenge lies in reducing the overall communication overhead and computational burden for distributed economic dispatch through learning-accelerated optimization, while addressing uncertainties in EV charging patterns, time-varying communication networks, and battery longevity constraints. This paper proposes a learning-accelerated distributed optimization framework for V2G-integrated microgrids. A novel alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) enhanced by deep neural networks, termed learning-accelerated ADMM (LA-ADMM), is developed to predict optimal dual variables, with theoretical convergence under dynamic network conditions rigorously proved. For handling EV uncertainties, the framework incorporates model predictive control (MPC) architecture with dispatch package strategies that minimize computational overhead through adaptive reuse of historical solutions during steady-state operations. Battery lifespan preservation is achieved through tight coupling of operational constraints with a universal constant current-constant voltage (CC-CV) charging protocol. Validation via IEEE 39-bus simulations and Raspberry Pi-based hardware experiments demonstrates 70.9% iteration reduction compared to ADMM-MPC baselines, effective peak shaving/valley filling, and &lt;2% deviation between simulated and physical power profiles.</description></item><item><title>Inertia-Emulation-Based Fast Frequency Response From EVs: A Multi-Level Framework With Game-Theoretic Incentives and DRL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142805</link><description>As the modern power grids increasingly integrate intermittent renewable energy sources, the reduction in system inertia creates challenges for frequency stability. Electric vehicles (EVs), with their rapid response capabilities and growing penetration, offer promising potential for providing virtual inertia services. In this paper, a novel fast frequency response framework with virtual inertia of EVs is proposed in a coupled power-transportation network. The proposed framework addresses the complex coordination required across multiple stakeholders through a hierarchical approach encompassing grid operators, charging stations (CSs), and EV users. At the grid level, the optimal inertia scheduling is developed to reduce system costs, considering the spatial-temporal characteristics of EVs and power fluctuations. For coordination between CSs, a game-theoretic incentive mechanism is designed to maximize collective benefits while encouraging EV participation in inertia services. In each CS, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based inertia control strategy can achieve the optimal inertia distribution, considering both EV battery conditions and user requirements. The simulation results illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. This approach provides a feasible operation solution for providing EV-based inertia in modern low-inertia grids.</description></item><item><title>Risk-Averse Decision-Dependent Distributionally Robust Optimization for the Resilient Cyber-Physical Distribution System Against Contingencies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126174</link><description>The cyber-physical deep coupling brings the distribution system the possibility of superposition vulnerability on cyber and physical spaces, which will potentially raise the unobservability and uncontrollability issues of the system, readily causing power outages during contingencies. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a resilience-oriented design for the cyber-physical distribution system based on a risk-averse decision-dependent distributionally robust optimization (DD-DRO) model. Firstly, observable and controllable intentional islands, as a promising way, are formed against contingencies by remote-controlled switch deployment, wireless communication configuration, and local controller activation. To this end, the cyber-physical coupling mechanism is investigated by hybrid wired/wireless communication modeling and fault propagation modeling, ensuring the cyber system&#8217;s observation and control. Secondly, reinforcement measures are adopted to mitigate the risk of uncertain contingencies, however, triggering decision-dependent uncertainty. To handle this uncertainty, the adaptive moment information method is developed to construct an N-k decision-dependent ambiguity set. Therefore, the proposed DD-DRO model is formulated and then recast to a mixed-integer linear programming problem by linearization techniques, which is solved by a customized nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm. Finally, numerical results on the modified IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 69-bus test systems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and method.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Sensing, Transmission and Control for QKD-IoT Empowered Power-Communication Coupling Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126162</link><description>Quantum-classical hybrid encryption has elevated security levels of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled distributed power control. However, the decoupled design of communication and power systems introduces substantial technical challenges. Outdated or tampered state data propagating from communication to power domains trigger cascading control failures, as demonstrated in the 2015 Ukraine grid cyberattack. This motivates us to investigate the fundamental question of how to achieve power-communication collaborative control optimization by proposing a cross-domain gap driven optimization framework of integrated sensing, transmission and control. Our novel framework addresses these limitations through three synergistic innovations: (i) accurate false data injection (FDI) attack sensing based on temporal correlation, (ii) secure data transmission based on hierarchical cooperative learning, and (iii) trust and delay-weighted consensus control. Its superiority is validated through simulations across diverse attack scenarios, grid topologies, and network scales. It exhibits strong scalability and robustness in large-scale complex grids. Key finding revels that blocking propagation paths of outdated and tampered consensus variables effectively mitigates control deviations and oscillations.</description></item><item><title>Self-Organizing Post-Contingency Distribution Network via Drone-Assisted Resilience-Oriented Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142358</link><description>Distribution networks with inverter-based distributed energy resources may increasingly face extreme events. While localized and islanded energy supply can enhance grid resilience, post-contingency distribution networks may struggle with efficient communication capabilities and energy sources owing to inevitably tight cyber-physical interdependence. Currently, post-contingency distribution networks do not comprehensively integrate cyber-physical self-organization capabilities using mobile resources. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a drone-assisted distribution network self-organization framework to enable operational data collection and control implementation, further maximizing the system resilience margin. Specifically, post-contingency communication services, i.e., data collection and control actuation, are scheduled via a multi-drone flight trajectory optimization considering drone recharging needs. Due to recharging periods with no emergency communication services, a resilience-oriented optimization is developed to co-optimize power injections and generator parameters for both static optimality and dynamic stability. This involves a compromised objective function that balances long-term energy consumption with short-term tolerant power imbalance. Finally, the proposed communication-control service provision framework is demonstrated through comprehensive case studies.</description></item><item><title>Exploring Smart Grid Vulnerability Against Intelligent Inverter Parameter Tampering Attack</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11159533</link><description>The integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) with inverter-based resources (IBRs) significantly improves remote management and monitoring capabilities of power electronic devices in modern power systems. Nevertheless, this integration presents significant security vulnerabilities, rendering smart inverters susceptible to various cyber threats. To this end, this paper develops a novel vulnerability exploration method for smart grids against IBR parameter tampering attacks. In particular, a zero-knowledge Destabilising Attack based on Fuzzing-Assisted Reinforcement Learning, named DAFARL, is proposed with the following steps. First, search engines are employed to explore vulnerable IBRs accessible via the Internet. Subsequently, smart grid stability sensitivity to parameter alterations in inverters is evaluated through the proposed fuzzing-assisted reinforcement learning approach, enabling the identification of critical parameters without prior knowledge of the system model. On this basis, an optimal attack strategy is then formulated, considering attack difficulty, risk, and computational efficiency to achieve the cost-benefit trade-off. Furthermore, the corresponding active and passive defense mechanisms are designed to mitigate the negative impact of attacks. In addition, electromagnetic transient simulations conducted on a modified IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that inverter-level parameter manipulations can lead to severe system-wide stability degradation. These results substantiate both the effectiveness of our proposed sensitivity analysis methodology and the stealth characteristics of DAFARL.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Agent Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning for HVAC Control With Flexible DERs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123597</link><description>As electricity consumption in commercial and residential buildings continues to rise, reducing energy costs presents an increasing challenge. Heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, which typically account for 40%&#8211;50% of a building&#8217;s energy use, are prime targets for energy savings. Intelligent control of HVAC temperature through the exploitation of HVAC load flexibility brings significant potential to reduce energy consumption and electricity expenses. The nonlinear models of HVAC systems challenge traditional control methods, while the uncertainty introduced by HVAC load flexibility complicates distributed energy resource (DER) management using conventional optimal dispatch techniques. In response to these challenges, we propose a hierarchical multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach. The lower-level agents focus on balancing comfort and energy conservation, while the upper-level DRL agents optimize the use of DERs to reduce peak demand based on the control outcomes of the HVAC by the lower-level agents. In the upper-level agents, we incorporate a multi-agent structure based on ensemble learning, which acts based on historical and current data without relying on precise load forecasting to address the delayed rewarding issue in DRL. This allows for the effective reduction of energy costs. The proposed method is tested using a real-world microgrid comprising 413 buildings in Southern California, and the results demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce overall electricity bills while ensuring the comfort of consumers and residents.</description></item><item><title>EdgeHEM: Sparse Federated Reinforcement Learning for Home Energy Management at the Edge</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11126167</link><description>With the growth of energy demand and the popularization of distributed energy resources, home energy management (HEM) has emerged as a crucial technology to improve energy efficiency and reduce electricity costs.

Network partitioning method can reduce such complexity by dividing the MGC into self-adequate partitions. However, existing dynamic network partitioning methods normally update the network partitioning results at fixed time intervals, which limits the ability to adapt to spatiotemporal variations in output of renewable energy sources (RESs), load demand, and grid topology. To address this, a dynamic network partitioning method based on an improved genetic algorithm (IGA) combined with depth-first search (DFS) is proposed. IGA is employed to optimize the partitioning index, and DFS is subsequently applied to obtain the network partitioning result. Furthermore, a dynamic update mechanism is designed to adaptively update the partitioning results according to spatiotemporal variations in system conditions. Simulation results on the modified IEEE 123-bus system show that the proposed method achieves better partitioning quality than the genetic algorithm (GA), spectral clustering, and Louvain algorithms while maintaining computational efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Tuning Friendly Deep Reinforcement Learning Method for Inverter-Based Volt/Var Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11119650</link><description>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods have been applied to power system problems in active distribution networks, including the inverter-based volt/var control (VVC).

However, the inherent security vulnerabilities of ground-to-air channels and the energy limitation issues of UAVs and wireless devices pose significant challenges to UAV-assisted data collection. Thus, this paper develops a secure and effective UAV-aided data collection scheme. In this scheme, each SN operates in either sleep or wake-up mode to conserve energy, and a UAV collects data from wake-up SNs in an eavesdropped environment. To prevent interception by an eavesdropper, other idle IoT devices are strategically chosen to act as friendly jammers to send artificial noise cooperatively. We aim to maximize the worst-case secrecy rate of the considered system by jointly optimizing UAV trajectory design, sensor scheduling, and jammer selection besides ensuring all the data from SNs are successfully collected by the UAV under the triple energy constraints of the UAV, SNs, and jammers and a maximum speed constraint for the UAV. Since the formulated problem is a challenging mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm to tackle this problem by exploiting block coordinate descent (BCD) and successive convex approximation (SCA). Finally, simulation results validate the superior performance of our proposed scheme compared to several baseline schemes in terms of secrecy rate.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Event-Triggered Multi-Objective Fault Detection for Turbofan Engine Sensors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11082013</link><description>Turbofan engine is the important power source of large uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), whose health status plays a vital role in the flight operation.

To alleviate this issue, a novel dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) array has been considered as an energy-efficient and cost-efficient alternative to the conventional fully-digital array deployed at each access point (AP). In this paper, we aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) in a DMA-based cell-free mmWave MIMO system by jointly optimizing user association, transmit beamformer, fronthaul compression and DMA weighting matrix, where both the limited fronthaul capacity and the near-field propagation effect are considered. To tackle this non-convex mixed-integer problem effectively, we propose a double-loop penalty dual decomposition (PDD) based algorithm with the aid of variable substitution and successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. In order to circumvent its high iteration complexity, we also develop a low-complexity alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm to find a high-quality suboptimal solution with a single-loop structure. Moreover, the extensions of our work to the partially-decentralized distributed implementation and the non-coherent transmission at distributed APs are discussed. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithms achieve superior performance over various benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>HADML: Hierarchical Asynchronous Deep Mutual Learning in Edge Intelligence Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11087760</link><description>Deep mutual learning (DML) stands out as a prominent technology in the rapidly evolving landscape of model compression over the past few years.

Hierarchical and asynchronous model aggregation methods can also fully leverage the advantages of device-to-device (D2D) based wireless networks. To improve the learning efficiency of HADML, we further formulate a non-convex optimization problem, aiming to minimize the average energy consumption for knowledge exchange by adjusting link scheduling and communication resource allocation. To solve this problem effectively, it is decomposed into two subproblems, and a joint graph neural network and deep unfolding network algorithm is developed to obtain the solutions.

However, these applications require higher computational power and lower latency, which present challenges to traditional network architectures. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel computing power network (CPN) architecture based on reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-Terahertz (THz) communication, and it aims to meet high computational demands. In the proposed scheme, CPN is introduced to assist IoT devices in executing tasks, thereby enhancing data processing. Concretely, THz communications and NOMA technologies are utilized to increase data rates and spectral efficiency. The combination of RIS and UAV shows promise in overcoming the challenges of high path loss and high sensitivity to blockage in THz communication, thereby improving system performance. To increase the efficiency of the proposed architecture, it is crucial to rationally allocate computational and transmission resources. Therefore, a joint optimization problem is formulated to minimize system consumption, encompassing both time and energy usage. To achieve efficient resource allocation, an adaptive N-Step method based on soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm is employed. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the existing baselines.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Carrier Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling for OTFS Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11078288</link><description>Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation technique is promising for high-mobility applications to achieve reliable communications. However, the capacity of OTFS systems is generally limited by the Nyquist criterion, requiring orthogonal pulses in both time and frequency domains. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-carrier faster-than-Nyquist (MC-FTN) signaling scheme for OTFS systems. By adopting non-orthogonal pulses in both time and frequency domains, our scheme significantly improves the capacity of OTFS systems. Specifically, we firstly develop the signal models for both single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OTFS systems. Then, we optimize the delay-Doppler (DD) domain precoding matrix at the transmitter to suppress both the inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) introduced by the MC-FTN signaling. For SISO systems, we develop an eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) precoding scheme with optimal power allocation (PA) for achieving the maximum capacity. For MIMO systems, we develop a successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based precoding scheme via decomposing the capacity maximization problem into multiple sub-capacity maximization problems with largely reduced dimensions of optimization variables. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed MC-FTN-OTFS signaling scheme achieves significantly higher capacity than traditional Nyquist-criterion-based OTFS systems. Moreover, the SIC-based precoding scheme can effectively reduce the complexity of MIMO capacity maximization, while attaining performance close to the optimal EVD-based precoding scheme.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Driven Learning for RIS-Assisted Multi-User MISO Beamforming and Reflection With Uplink Channel Information</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079883</link><description>Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can improve wireless transmission performance by passive reflective elements to reconfigure the wireless propagation environment. However, the traditional optimization approach has a high complexity when jointly optimizing phase shifts at the RIS and the beamforming at the base station (BS). This paper focuses on the sum rate maximization problem with the transmit power constraint and the phase constraint, for the RIS-assisted multiuser multiple-input-single-output (MISO) downlink transmission where the downlink and uplink channel reciprocity does not exist. To solve this problem, we propose a data and model-driven learning approach via a hybrid learning manner. Specifically, we adopt an optimal beamforming structure to effectively reduce the output dimension and to improve the training and testing efficiency of the neural network. Then, we provide a learning framework including several fully-connected neural networks to learn the mapping between uplink and downlink channels, power features of the beamforming, and phase-shift matrices, after which the optimal beamforming can be recovered by the proposed beamforming structure. Simulation results show that our proposed method achieves better rate performance than state-of-the-art data-driven learning approaches.</description></item><item><title>Beamforming Design for RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems Under Finite Channel Blocklength Transmissions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11080336</link><description>Thanks to low path-loss and high macro-diversity gain, the cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is regarded as a perspective technique to realize ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) for future wireless systems. In this paper, we consider the emerging reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to further improve the capability of CF massive MIMO system in URLLC provision. Under the finite channel blocklength regime, we formulate the sum spectral efficiency (SE) maximization problem to jointly design the active beamforming of access points (APs) and the passive beamforming of RISs. To resolve this non-convex problem, we establish a tight logarithmically lower bound based on the majorization minimization criterion to replace the complicated objective function. Then, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to solve two subproblems and derive the closed-form solutions of both active and passive beamformings. Taking into account the extra power consumption of RISs, we utilize the novel performance metric named resource efficiency (RE) to investigate the trade-off between SE and energy efficiency (EE) in RIS-aided CF massive MIMO URLLC systems. Moreover, a variant bisection search algorithm is developed to maximize the system RE. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed lower bound for optimizing the RIS-aided CF massive MIMO URLLC system. The proposed algorithms are also effective in improving the sum-SE and striking the SE-EE balance of RIS-aided CF massive MIMO URLLC systems.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Type Disaster Scenario Task Offloading in Air&#8211;Ground Integrated Search and Rescue Networks: A Blockchain-Assisted MFL Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11074756</link><description>Inrecent years, autonomous aerial vehicle (UAV) has demonstrated significant potential in Search and Rescue (SAR) operations by providing real-time high-definition image and video data. However, their limited computational power and battery capacity may hinder performance in executing computationally intensive tasks. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an innovative edge computing model that leverages flexibly deployed autonomous ground vehicle (UGV) to assist UAVs in performing SAR missions. Our approach optimizes UAV task splitting, computing resource allocation, offloading decisions, and flight trajectories to minimize system energy consumption as well as network coverage overlap areas. To tackle the coupling issue between short-term offloading decisions and long-term queue constraints, Lyapunov optimization is utilized. Subsequently, a blockchain-assisted algorithm based on Meta-Federated Learning (MFL) is designed, which can significantly enhance system reliability and security.

To begin with, an optimization problem for the average content downloading delay minimization is formulated, by jointly optimizing the caching placement, trajectory, and transmit power of the drone, while satisfying the cache capacity, total transmit power, and kinematics constraints of the drones. However, there is an unpredictable nature in the environment, such as changes in content requests, locations of the users and drones, making it difficult to be solved by traditional optimization methods. In order to address this difficulty, the formulated problem is firstly modeled as a Markov decision process, and then a deep reinforcement learning framework based on dual-clip proximity policy optimization (DC-PPO) algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. The algorithm adaptively searches for caching placement, trajectory, and transmit power of drone, and a better match between action and state is ensured by using a soft greed strategy to make decisions. Finally, extensive simulation results show that the proposed DC-PPO algorithm outperforms the benchmark algorithms in terms of the average content downloading delay and the convergence speed. Moreover, compared to other schemes, the average content downloading delay is reduced by the proposed joint design scheme.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Task Offloading in Vehicular Edge Computing Using Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11079801</link><description>Vehicular edge computing (VEC) systems face critical challenges in balancing computational efficiency, task delay, and data privacy. This paper presents a Federated Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (FMADRL) framework to achieve privacy-preserving task offloading in dynamic vehicular networks. The proposed method leverages federated learning to collaboratively train task offloading policies across vehicles, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) servers, and the cloud, ensuring that sensitive data remains localized while enabling global optimization. A novel reward function is designed to balance task completion, delay, energy consumption, and privacy constraints, while a federated actor-critic model ensures robust decision-making under dynamic network conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that the FMADRL framework significantly reduces average task delay and energy consumption by 30% and 25%, respectively, compared to traditional methods, while maintaining data privacy. These findings underscore the potential of FMADRL to enhance the scalability, efficiency, and security of VEC systems in intelligent transportation networks.</description></item><item><title>Joint Service Caching and Task Offloading for Multi-UAV-Assisted Offshore Edge Computing Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11081466</link><description>Marine Internet of Things devices (MIoTDs) are inherently constrained by limited computation resources, while conventional mobile edge computing implementation faces significant challenges in offshore environments due to unstable shore-based communications and widespread device distribution. To this end, this paper proposes an integrated offshore-aerial edge computing and caching architecture where multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), capable of dynamically adjusting their three-dimensional positions for optimal service coverage, serve as edge servers collaborating with a shore-based base station to provide computing and caching services for MIoTDs. The objective is to minimize the total system latency by jointly optimizing task offloading ratios, user association decisions, and service caching decisions, subject to MIoTD energy, UAV energy, and cache capacity constraints. To solve the resulting mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm that decomposes it into tractable subproblems, strategically employing coalition game, linear relaxation, and Lagrangian dual methods to address their distinct mathematical structures. Extensive numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme reduces the total latency by 15.18%, 8.90%, and 8.38% compared to local-only computing, random caching, and fixed offloading baselines, respectively, while ensuring fair service provision across MIoTDs.</description></item><item><title>Age of Information Optimization for UAV Deployment With Covert Communication: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11080333</link><description>With the rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), ensuring the timeliness of information has become increasingly critical. However, the broadcast nature of IoT data transmission poses significant challenges to secure communication. This paper investigates a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted uplink covert communication system comprising a covert IoT device (CIoTD) and multiple public IoT devices (PIoTDs). The CIoTD is required to transmit data covertly, with its transmission covertness being further improved by leveraging the UAV's mobility and the interference introduced by the PIoTDs. The objective is to minimize the age of information (AoI) of the PIoTDs while satisfying the covert communication constraint of the CIoTD. To this end, we analyze the covert constraint and propose a proximal policy optimization (PPO)-based scheme to jointly optimize the UAV's hovering position and the CIoTD's transmission power. Simulation results show that the proposed approach significantly improves information timeliness, without compromising the covert communication performance, when compared with baseline schemes.</description></item><item><title>Advancements in Self-Assembled Monolayers for Perovskite Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11284797</link><description>Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are well known as a promising strategy for enhancing the efficiency, stability, and interfacial properties of perovskite solar cells (PSCs).

However, irradiance variability and partial shading pose significant challenges to system stability and efficiency. This study evaluates three advanced nonisolated dc&#8211;dc converter topologies: interleaved boost, quadratic boost, and multi-input/single-output (MISO) under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control using the perturb and observe algorithm. Simulations were conducted in Simulink using real irradiance and temperature data collected in a high solar irradiance place, such as Antofagasta, Chile. The system comprises 600 photovoltaic cells ($350\, \mathrm{V}$) connected to a $540\,\mathrm{ V}$ dc-Link bus and a $50\, \text{kWh}$ LiFePO$_{4}$ battery bank. Key performance metrics, such as voltage gain, efficiency, current ripple, and duty cycle behavior, were analyzed under three solar scenarios. Under favorable irradiance, all topologies delivered over $3.2\, \text{kW}$ with ideal efficiencies above 98.4%. The interleaved topology demonstrated strong steady-state performance but limited transient regulation. The quadratic converter operated with a low duty cycle yet showed greater sensitivity to disturbances. In contrast, the MISO converter consistently maintained a stable output, low ripple, and high efficiency even under minimal irradiance conditions (70 W/m$^{2}$). These results position the MISO topology as the most robust solution for variable urban environments, ensuring reliable energy delivery and supporting the efficient deployment of ViPV systems in electric mobility applications.</description></item><item><title>Tracking Concepts for High-Density PV Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11205357</link><description>In the search for new sites, photovoltaic (PV) system installations spread out into complex places and contexts, such as hilly terrain, floating PV, and agriPV. It is, therefore, plausible to assume that PV power plants will increasingly need to use space and, thus, sunlight more efficiently, e.g., by not wasting solar energy in the space between module rows. This means it may become increasingly important to consider the energy output of PV systems per area of land use, i.e., the &#8220;efficiency of the PV system.&#8221; To increase this efficiency, power plants with high density of PV modules are needed. For tracked systems, this necessitates adapting the tracking strategies to avoid excessive losses from either row-to-row shading or angle-of-incidence losses in backtracking. This article explores different tracking strategies that could contribute to enabling high-density PV power plants with high efficiency. The advantages of these advanced tracking strategies are quantified at two different latitudes as a function of the ground coverage ratio.</description></item><item><title>Floating Offshore Solar Photovoltaics for Land-Constrained and Diverse Renewable Supply Conditions in the United States and Canada</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11214224</link><description>Energy transition pathways for large continental areas are largely understood to be achievable using a diverse set of onshore renewable energy technologies. Previous research for the integrated United States and Canada energy&#8211;industry system indicated that solar photovoltaics (PVs) may dominate the primary energy structure, complemented by onshore wind power. However, societal constraints may require increased supply diversity, and onshore renewable energy may not be sufficient for densely populated regions, especially on the east coast of the United States. The LUT Energy System Transition Model was applied to investigate the role of floating offshore solar PV coupled with offshore wind and wave power when onshore solar PV is limited. The results indicate that, when onshore solar PV is limited to 60% of electricity generation, 434 GW of floating offshore solar PV may be installed by 2050 as part of a hybrid power plant sharing the same grid connection as offshore wind power, which reaches 414 GW of installed capacity, contributing 607 and 1576 TWh to the electricity supply, respectively. In total, 7.4 TW of solar PV capacity is installed by 2050, complemented by 1.4 TW of onshore wind power. Increased supply diversity still leads to a 42% reduction in the levelized cost of electricity, reaching 32.7 &#8364;/MWh in 2050. Compared with cost-optimal conditions, the levelized cost of final energy and nonenergy use in 2050 increases by 28% to 52.7 &#8364;/MWh. Nevertheless, such increased costs may be justifiable to meet societal constraints, and a diverse power-to-X economy structure for the United States and Canada may still be technoeconomically viable.</description></item><item><title>Performance Limits in Bifacial Tandem Solar Cell Modules for Multiple Configurations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11224657</link><description>While bifacial tandem photovoltaic technology is promising as it is able to generate higher electrical power output by accessing illumination from both front and rear surfaces, a thorough investigation of the performance limits of bifacial tandems with different architectures/arrangements and under different conditions has not been explored. In this work, we present a comprehensive analytical framework based on the principle of detailed balance to assess the performance limits of bifacial tandems spanning multiple architectures, including unconstrained, current-matched (CM), and voltage-matched (VM) configurations. Our methodology explores the performance benefits of incorporating area-decoupled subcells across layers and examines the impact of different bandgap arrangements (monotonic and non-monotonic) on the performance. We show that having non-monotonic arrangement of bandgaps under optimal albedo conditions can significantly enhance the performance of bifacial tandems. In addition, we analyze the performance resilience of each configuration and bandgap arrangement to spectral variations induced by environmental factors such as shading, fluctuations in temperature, and albedo. This provides crucial design guidelines for the design, fabrication, and estimation of the performance limits of these solar cell architectures in different conditions.</description></item><item><title>Performance Enhancement of Bifacial PV Modules on Horizontal Single-Axis Trackers in Desert Environments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11206410</link><description>The adoption of bifacial photovoltaic (PV) modules has grown significantly due to their potential for higher energy yield.

Reliably managing high penetrations of solar PV within modern grids requires predictions that reflect the systemic consequences of fast renewable variability across cyber-physical energy infrastructure. This article proposes RR-LTNet, a ramp-rate (RR)-centric prediction architecture that elevates the RR as the core variability feature linking plant-level intermittency to grid-level operational risk. RR-LTNet first performs dynamic clustering of RR regimes to characterize rapid weather transitions and stability conditions. These regimes taken as feature for hybrid temporal learner that fuses recurrent memory with temporal convolution to capture multiscale dynamics. For predictive assessment, numerical experiments are conducted on one year solar power database of the Yulara Solar Project, Australia. The proposed RR-LTNet consistently outperforms other feature extraction methods by achieving up to 90% reductions in root mean square error (RMSE) for 5-min resolution. The reductions are significantly larger when baseline models are augmented with RR-aware features than when those features are absent. Cross-site validation on two additional PV plants with different capacity and data distribution confirms robustness and consistency required for system engineering deployment across fleets. By surfacing variability intelligence in real time, RR-LTNet supports PV-specific tasks central to reserve scheduling, advanced simulation of PV plant-grid interactions. This framework thus bridges PV monitoring analytics with system level reliability engineering, accelerating the integration of large-scale PV into modern power systems.</description></item><item><title>A 57.2 nW, 1.3&#8211;5 V VIN, &#8211;85 dB PSRR, 50 &#956;s Start-Up Time, Bandgap Reference Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11127192</link><description>This article presents a low-power bandgap reference (BGR) featuring high power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) and fast start-up capability, operating across a wide supply voltage range of 1.3&#8211;5 V. A novel prebiased pulse current injection technique is proposed in the start-up circuit, achieving a 1% settling time of  $50~\mu $ s and a  $25\times $  speed gain during start-up. To enhance supply noise immunity, the proposed BGR employs a preregulated (PR)-based amplifier that effectively decouples the reference voltage from supply voltage fluctuations.

Although duty cycling minimizes power consumption, synchronization with a base station or other devices requires periodic activation. Inaccuracies in the wake-up timer extend the active duration around the expected synchronization time, leading to increased energy consumption, which is especially critical in high-duty-cycle operations. This article presents a low-power digital compensation method to enhance the accuracy of a crystal oscillator (XO)-based wake-up timer over varying temperatures. The proposed approach dynamically adjusts the digital counter threshold value at each wake-up to compensate for XO frequency shifts caused by temperature changes. Delta-sigma ( $\Delta \Sigma $ ) modulation further reduces quantization noise for fractional time corrections. This work demonstrates the proposed technique on an existing low-power, miniature IoT system incorporating an exponential temperature sensor and employs two key strategies: 1) approximating the compensation curve as linear segments for simpler calculations and 2) replacing division-heavy operations with a successive approximation (SAR) method. These methods reduce the system&#8217;s time-shift error from 64.7 to 3.6 ppm using a single-point room-temperature calibration combined with adaptive temperature compensation, with a power overhead of only 7.92% (8.22 nW compensation +5.58 nW XO). Furthermore, a custom digital circuit for compensation minimizes the system power overhead to 5.07% (3.24 nW compensation +5.58 nW XO). Compared to state-of-the-art temperature-compensated XOs (TCXOs) using analog approaches, the proposed design reduces the power consumption by a factor of  $2.37\times $  while meeting the required time-error specification.</description></item><item><title>A 35.2-kHz, 75.4-dB Bulk-Driven OTA Using Degenerative Current Tram Structure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11147155</link><description>This article reports on the design of a high-performance operational transconductance amplifier (OTA) based on a degenerative current translation and mirroring (DI-Tram) circuit.

Traditional DPD solutions are primarily designed for scenarios where PAs operate at a constant average power level (PL) and thus cannot be directly applied, as the PA is a dynamic nonlinear system significantly influenced by PLs. To address this issue, a self-adaptive residual long short-term memory (SAR_LSTM) neural network (NN) is proposed in this article for wide dynamic power range quadrature switched-capacitor PAs (SCPAs). The proposed model adopts a two-stage approach comprising a power variation module (PVM) and a residual LSTM (R_LSTM). In the first stage, the PVM generates a power variation-dependent feature vector, which is then multiplied with the original input signal. In the second stage, the adjusted input signal passes through the R_LSTM to perform the corresponding predistortion calibration. This process tightly integrates the underlying causes of power variation in the SCPA circuit with our model, enabling highly accurate self-adaptive calibration across a wide dynamic power range without requiring parameter updates. In the measurement, a 15-bit transformer-based quadrature SCPA chip with Class-G and IQ-cell-sharing techniques is implemented in a 28-nm CMOS process and employed to verify our method. For the 802.11ax 40-MHz 64-QAM signal at 2.4 GHz, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior linearization performance compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, with an average adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) of &#8722;39.5 dB and an average error vector magnitude (EVM) of &#8722;41.6 dB over a 30-dB dynamic power range.</description></item><item><title>Independently Reconfigurable Multiband All-Digital Transmitter Using SMASH Delta-Sigma Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11218024</link><description>A multiband reconfigurable all-digital transmitter (ADT) employing a sturdy multistage noise-shaping (SMASH) delta-sigma modulation (DSM) is proposed in this article. The N-stage SMASH DSM is presented digitally using unit signal transfer functions across cascaded stages, which supports arbitrary-stage extension for multiband transmission. Each stage is associated with a specific passband. By activating different stage numbers and adjusting only two parameters per stage, the numbers and frequencies of passbands are reconfigured simply and independently. Consequently, computational resources are significantly reduced, which is especially beneficial for four or more bands. Furthermore, the DSM outputs are directly extracted from individual stages to simplify the ADT architecture while the high efficiencies of subsequent power amplifiers (PAs) are maintained. By using the SMASH DSM, an ADT with multiband reconfigurable characteristics is proposed. With a resource-performance tradeoff, an ADT prototype based on a 2&#8211;2 SMASH DSM is implemented on a field programmable gate array (FPGA), which uses only 256 DSP48 slices. The transmissions are switched between single-band and dual-band configurations with carrier frequencies (CFs) independently tunable over 0&#8211;3.2 GHz. Measured adjacent channel leakage ratios (ACLRs) for 10- and 20-MHz dual-band signals are below &#8722;45 and &#8722;39.5 dBc, respectively, with error vector magnitudes (EVMs) below 1.6%. These results verify the agile multiband reconfiguration and excellent performance of the proposed SMASH DSM-based ADT.</description></item><item><title>High-Performance Gemmini-Based Matrix Multiplication Accelerator for Deep Learning Workloads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153792</link><description>Transformer models have recently gained considerable attention in computer vision applications due to their capacity to capture relations among features, resulting in enhanced performance. Moreover, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been extensively researched due to their superior performance and applicability in several domains, including image classification, detection, and recognition. Matrix multiplications are crucial operations in Transformers and DNN, and computations such as weight stationary (WS) and output stationary (OS) are considered to meet the dataflow constraints. This work presents a systolic array (SA)-based general matrix multiplication (GEMM) architecture for Gemmini accelerators, enabling the performance of convolutions in neural networks and self-attention in Transformers. First, this work proposes a multiplier-optimized SA (MOSA) by integrating a novel multiplier. The multiplier is designed using a single-stage stacking-based 3:2 and 4:2 compressors. The proposed MOSA achieves significant improvements, with area savings ranging from 12% to 92% for 8-bit designs and 87%&#8211;89% for 16-bit designs across  $8 \times 8$ ,  $16 \times 16$ ,  $32 \times 32$ , and  $64 \times 64$  SAs. The proposed multiplier is employed to present a high-performance Gemmini SA for WS and OS dataflow; further modifications to the processing element (PE) are presented to achieve better performance over the existing Gemmini accelerator. In particular, the proposed WS PE achieves power-delay product (PDP) savings of 56%&#8211;59% and area-delay product (ADP) reductions of 45%&#8211;51%, while the OS PE shows PDP savings of 10%&#8211;46% and ADP reductions of 6%&#8211;42%. The analysis is further extended to both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers by integrating the proposed SA into complete inference pipelines, including AlexNet, MobileNetV2, and ResNet-50 for CNNs, and the self-attention mechanism of TinyBERT for Transformers. The MOSA-32 design delivers a GOPS improvement of 12%&#8211;91% across different CNN models and up to  $5.24\times $  for Transformer workloads. Similarly, MOSA-64 achieves up to 98% improvements across CNNs and up to  $6.14\times $  gains for Transformers. These improvements validate the effectiveness of the proposed energy-efficient PE design and its seamless integration into Gemmini SA, making the proposed architecture suitable for next-generation AI and Transformer accelerators for edge computing applications.</description></item><item><title>SteROI-D: System Design and Mapping for Stereo Depth Inference on Regions of Interest</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11180152</link><description>Machine learning algorithms have enabled high-quality stereo depth estimation to run on augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) devices. However, high energy consumption across the full-image processing stack prevents stereo depth algorithms from running effectively on battery-limited devices. This article introduces SteROI-D, a full-stereo depth system paired with a mapping methodology. SteROI-D exploits region-of-interest (ROI) and temporal sparsity at the system level to save energy. SteROI-D&#8217;s flexible and heterogeneous compute fabric supports diverse ROIs. Importantly, we introduce a systematic mapping methodology to effectively handle dynamic ROIs, thereby maximizing energy savings. Using these techniques, our 28-nm prototype SteROI-D design achieves up to  $3.92\times $  reduction in total system energy compared with a baseline application specific integrated circuit (ASIC).</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid-Structured Lossless Compression&#8211;Decompression Engine for Intermediate Feature Maps in Vision Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11192557</link><description>With the continuous evolution of vision neural networks, the off-chip transmission and storage of intermediate feature maps have become a major bottleneck during inference, especially in resource-constrained edge devices. Lossless compression of the intermediate feature maps exhibits the plug-and-play feature without requiring additional evaluation or retraining. However, previous lossless compression hardware engines face challenges in the tradeoff between hardware complexity and compression ratio. To address this issue, this article proposes a hybrid-structured lossless compression and decompression engine of intermediate feature maps in vision neural networks. The proposed work combines multidimensional prediction, run-length encoding (RLE), and extended encoding (EE). In the predictive stage, delta and contextual prediction are employed to enhance sparsity for compression efficiency. In the encoding stage, RLE minimizes redundancy between adjacent bytes, and EE is used to select various compression methods to decrease bit-level redundancy dynamically. The average compression ratio of widely used vision neural networks is 48.42%, which is better than that of Huffman coding. Compared with the state-of-the-art works, it improves the average compression ratio by 20.90%. For hardware implementation, hardware reuse and data reuse are employed to achieve 17.95% and 21.18% reduction of the gate count and the power, respectively. Experimental results show that we achieve a throughput-per-area of 1.10 [(bits/cycle)/K GCs] and a throughput-per-power of 1.19 [(bits/cycle)/mW] in the 28-nm process node.</description></item><item><title>Resource Optimization in Polyphase-Filter STFT Based on Time-Multiplexed Constant Multiplication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11165182</link><description>Real-time spectrum analysis is widely used in applications such as embedded audio analytics, digital acquisition instruments, electronic warfare, and micro-Doppler radar. These applications heavily rely on the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) engine, which delivers high throughput and leads to strict area and power budgets. However, current STFT architectures implemented on hardware still rely on massive arrays of generic multipliers or on-chip memories that store precomputed window coefficients, thereby limiting flexibility and increasing latency and resource consumption. The optimized windowing unit of the polyphase-filter STFT architecture proposed in this article is redesigned by time-multiplexed single and multiple constant multiplication (Tm-SCM/MCM) that are created from directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The Tm-SCM-based design can replace the original generic multiplier. The Tm-MCM-based design can reduce the adders and multiplexers (MUXs) by analyzing the window function coefficients among different channels. Both methods can minimize the redundant adders and MUXs compared with the existing algorithms and remove all DSP generic multipliers. Experiments on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and ASIC show that the proposed Tm-SCM/MCM Hann window core reduces area and delay and lowers dynamic power. When the same cores are integrated into a 32-point STFT, overall slice count drops, all BRAM blocks in the windowing unit are removed, latency stays low, output SQNR matches recent polyphase and fast Fourier transform (FFT)-based designs, and figure-of-merit analysis confirms that the proposed architecture delivers the best overall balance of resources, speed, and power among the compared solutions. These findings show that optimization of windowing units by constant multiplication offers a cost-effective solution for upcoming high-overlap, real-time STFT applications by concurrently reducing resource footprint and maintaining spectral fidelity.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Polynomial Multiplication Accelerator for Lattice-Based Cryptography With a 2-D Winograd-Based Divide-and-Conquer Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151218</link><description>Polynomial multiplication over rings constitutes one of the most computationally expensive operations in lattice-based cryptography. To accelerate it, the algorithm based on divide-and-conquer has received extensive attention because it has no strict parameter restrictions compared with the number theoretic transform (NTT). Among divide-and-conquer algorithms, apart from algorithms like Karatsuba and Schoolbook, the Winograd-based method has emerged as a new approach. This is because it can reduce the amount of computation while maintaining the scalability of parallelism. However, the parameters of the existing Winograd-based polynomial multiplication algorithm are conservative, and there is potential for further reducing the computational load. Therefore, we propose a novel and efficient 2-D Winograd-based polynomial multiplication (2-D WPM) algorithm. In this algorithm, we adopt the 2-D Winograd to alleviate the large denominator divisions and large-number multiplications that occur in the conventional 1-D Winograd as the parameter increases. We also propose a division elimination method to eliminate the inevitable divisions in the 2-D Winograd. When the polynomial length is 1024, compared with Schoolbook, 2-D WPM ( ${m} =3$ ,  ${r} =3$ ) can reduce the number of basic multiplications by 69%. In addition, an efficient polynomial multiplication accelerator for lattice-based cryptography named EPMA is proposed. In EPMA, we design reconfigurable modular arithmetic units to support both prime moduli and power-of-2 moduli. Keeping the full pipelined structure of EPMA, we also fully reuse the input data and the Winograd transformation results to achieve the conservation of hardware resources. EPMA is implemented on Xilinx FPGAs. Compared with previous works on FPGAs, under the same platform and parameters, the area efficiency of EPMA achieves an improvement of  $1.22\times $  to  $18.02\times $ . Compared with previous works on CPUs and GPUs, the computing speed of EPMA achieves an improvement of 9.25 to  $1294.51\times $ .</description></item><item><title>Coordinating Binary Trait: Accurate and Lightweight Runtime On-Chip Power Meter Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11135453</link><description>As heterogeneous platforms scale, power management issues grow increasingly critical. On-chip power awareness is fundamental to effective power management on such platforms. However, the integration of diverse components leads to higher power consumption and more complex power patterns, complicating the perception of power distribution. To address this challenge, this article presents COordinating BInary Trait (COBIT), which focuses on the design and optimization of on-chip power meters (OPMs) for heterogeneous design, enabling power management in large-scale systems. COBIT extracts essential bitwise wires as features, learns a boosting model based on binary trees, and implements the OPM for runtime power prediction. Additionally, multiobjective optimization algorithms are employed in the design space exploration of the power meter to ensure an accurate and low-overhead integration. Experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of COBIT on heterogeneous hardware. Using only 0.028% bitwise power proxies of all RTL wires in the NVIDIA deep learning accelerator (NVDLA) and 0.036% in the Berkeley out-of-order machine (BOOM) processor core, the per-cycle models achieve a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 1.69% and 2.49%, respectively. Regarding the success rate of predictions on power peaks in NVDLA, COBIT achieves a maximum performance improvement of 12.93% and an average improvement of 8.11% over existing methods. Moreover, the gate-area/power overhead of our OPM on BOOM and NVDLA is 1.25%/0.217% and 0.49%/0.097%, respectively, while performing per-cycle power prediction in just three cycles. Unlike previous approaches, which struggle with balancing accuracy and efficiency, COBIT effectively addresses both challenges, delivering unprecedented benefits for large-scale systems.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Stochastic-Binary Computing Batch Normalization Engine for Low-Power On-Chip Learning Spiking Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11148273</link><description>Batch normalization (BN) has proven to be a critical component in speeding up the training of deep spiking neural networks in deep learning. However, conventional BN implementations face significant challenges in terms of excessive off-chip memory bandwidth requirements and complex circuit designs, hindering their applicability for on-chip training in spiking neural networks (SNNs). This article introduces a novel hybrid stochastic-binary computing BN engine (HBN) that strikes an optimal balance between computational efficiency and hardware resource utilization, enabling efficient on-chip learning for SNNs. While conventional binary-mode BN engines offer temporal efficiency, they demand substantial hardware resources. In contrast, stochastic computing (SC)-based BN approaches reduce hardware overhead but introduce latency penalties and necessitate additional random number generation (RNG) circuits. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid architecture that seamlessly integrates binary and stochastic computing (SC) paradigms. Our co-designed methodology effectively balances computational latency and hardware footprint. This is achieved by a rounding-free SC multiplier unified with binary-circuit map ping, which eliminates latency and RNG overheads. Extensive validation across both static image datasets and neuromorphic datasets demonstrates that HBN maintains algorithmic fidelity while achieving unprecedented computational efficiency. Simulation results reveal 98.7% reduction in floating-point operations (FLOPs), 98.5% latency improvement, and 98.2% energy consumption reduction compared with conventional BN implementations. FPGA implementation on the ZCU102 platform demonstrates practical hardware advantages, including 74.9% reduction in look-up table (LUT) utilization, 83.6% decrease in flip-flop (FF) count, and 13.7% reduction in block RAM (BRAM) allocation. Notably, the design achieves 63.7% power reduction compared with state-of-the-art implementations while maintaining complete DSP-free operation.</description></item><item><title>Bitline-Paired 2T SOT-MRAM Cell for Energy-Efficient Memory Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11145964</link><description>Spin-orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) has recently gained great attention due to its various benefits on memory implementation. However, SOT-MRAM suffers from high read and write energy consumption, making it difficult to replace conventional CMOS-based memories. This article presents a novel bitline (BL)-paired 2T SOT-MRAM cell structure, where the read and write path can be decoupled without causing bit-cell area overhead. Thanks to the separation of the read and write path, the BL parasitic capacitance can be reduced, which ultimately reduces read energy consumption. In addition, the read scheme tailored to the bit-cell structure is proposed to further enhance the read energy. The proposed cell also shows considerable write energy improvement when applying the write termination techniques that require simultaneous read and write operations. The HSPICE circuit simulations using the 28-nm CMOS technology show that the proposed BL-paired 2T SOT-MRAM cell with BL sharing achieves an average of 42.9% read energy savings, and an average of 56.8% write energy reduction compared to the conventional 2T cell in a  $512\times 512$  array. The system simulations using the gem5 simulator also show that, compared to the conventional 2T cell, an average of 47.1% of dynamic energy can be saved in various SPEC2006 benchmarks when the BL-paired 2T cell is employed in L2 cache.</description></item><item><title>ASNA-Flow: An Efficient Asynchronous Neuromorphic Accelerator for Real-Time Event-Based Optical Flow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11142472</link><description>Optical flow estimation constitutes a fundamental computational challenge in computer vision, with critical applications object trajectory prediction, depth reconstruction, and autonomous navigation systems. The emergence of neuromorphic vision systems, integrating event-driven cameras with spiking neural networks (SNNs), has recently gained attention as a promising paradigm for edge deployment of optical flow estimation due to their advantages in ultralow power and resource efficiency. However, current neuromorphic computing platforms lack specialized architectures optimized for this problem domain. Existing implementations either prioritize configurable architectures at the expense of energy efficiency or employ intricate hardware control mechanisms to manage the asynchronous and sparse computing patterns inherent in SNNs. To address these limitations, we present ASNA-Flow, an event-driven asynchronous neuromorphic accelerator featuring a pioneering algorithm&#8211;hardware co-design framework specifically tailored for event-based optical flow estimation. Our methodology encompasses three key innovations: 1) a hardware-aware algorithm optimization that maintains computational fidelity while enhancing implementation efficiency; 2) systematic data pattern analysis to inform architectural decisions; and 3) novel exploitation of optical flow&#8217;s spatial locality characteristics to enable efficient sparse computing. Implemented in TSMC 28-nm CMOS technology, ASNA-Flow achieves real-time performance of 104 frames per second (FPS) with ultralow power consumption of 7.9 mW, demonstrating superior energy efficiency of 0.3 pJ per synaptic operation (SOP). This work establishes the first dedicated neuromorphic computing solution that simultaneously addresses the temporal sparsity, event-driven processing, and energy constraints inherent in optical flow estimation tasks.</description></item><item><title>Unlimited Vector Processing for Wireless Baseband Based on RISC-V Extension</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11152337</link><description>Wireless baseband processing (WBP) serves as an ideal scenario for utilizing vector processing, which excels in managing data-parallel operations due to its parallel structure. However, conventional vector architectures face certain constraints such as limited vector register sizes, reliance on power-of-two vector length (VL) multipliers, and vector permutation capabilities tied to specific architectures. To address these challenges, we have introduced an instruction set extension (ISE) based on RISC-V known as unlimited vector processing (UVP). This extension enhances both the flexibility and efficiency of vector computations. UVP employs a novel programming model that supports non-power-of-two register groupings (RGs) and hardware strip mining, thus enabling smooth handling of vectors of varying lengths while reducing the software strip-mining burden. Vector instructions are categorized into symmetric and asymmetric classes, complemented by specialized load/store strategies to optimize execution. Moreover, we present a hardware implementation of UVP featuring sophisticated hazard detection mechanisms, optimized pipelines for symmetric tasks such as fixed-point multiplication and division, and a robust permutation engine for effective asymmetric operations. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that UVP significantly enhances performance, achieving up to  $3.0\times $  and  $2.1\times $  speedups in matrix multiplication and fast Fourier transform (FFT) tasks, respectively, when measured against lane-based vector architectures. Our synthesized register transfer level (RTL) for a 16-lane configuration using SMIC 40-nm technology spans 0.94 mm2 and achieves an area efficiency of 21.2 GOPS/mm2.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Parallel Testing and Implicit Cost-Driven Tuning of RF-MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11204724</link><description>Modern wireless communications systems deploy massive MIMO systems with large numbers of transmit and receive antennas and analog-digital RF transceiver architectures that admit RF beamforming. These systems need to be tested and tuned postmanufacture to ensure signal quality. In analog architectures, this poses a problem due to the lack of observability of internal circuit nodes and due to the convergence of multiple RF beamforming chains into a combined baseband signal from which it is difficult to de-embed individual RF chain behaviors. Existing test techniques estimate nonlinearities in RF chains up to the third order and require significant frequency bandwidth to test multiple RF chains in a MIMO system in parallel, thereby reducing the overall test time. In this research, to improve testing efficiency, overlapping test tones over a minimal frequency range are applied to each of the MIMO RF chains in parallel, allowing specifications of individual RF chains up to fifth-order distortion to be determined accurately. For postmanufacture tuning, a response feature clustering approach followed by an implicit cost-driven tuning procedure is proposed. Tuning for error vector magnitude (EVM) and signal-to-interference ratio (SiNR) is performed under power constraints. Experimental results show that the proposed parallel testing methodology is  $1.7\times $  more frequency-efficient than existing techniques, and the proposed postmanufacture tuning algorithm can tune a receiver with four RF chains in 1.8 ms.</description></item><item><title>POCA: First Power-on Chip Authentication and Key Exchange for Secure Provisioning in System-on-Chip</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11153572</link><description>In a horizontal business model, the manufacturing and testing of system-on-chip (SoC) design at offshore facilities has proven to be a cost-effective strategy for fabless design houses. This, however, has led to growing concerns about the security and reliability of chips manufactured by outsourced semiconductor foundries, assembly, and test entities. As such, untrusted entities have access to the entire chip design; they may exploit opportunities for IP piracy, overproduction, cloning, shipping defective or out-of-specification chips, and insecure boot. Design houses must address these concerns by securing the die/packaged chips and their assets in such an untrusted environment. Unfortunately, this cannot be accomplished by any of the current security primitives [e.g., physical unclonable functions (PUFs)] due to their inherent limitations at this stage. Furthermore, provisioning the security assets requires a secure key exchange protocol, which is difficult to accomplish with untrusted entities (tester and software proxies) existing between the die/chip under test and the secure cloud server. This article introduces a novel security primitive and a power-on chip authentication protocol called POCA, which enables the secure provisioning of security assets during wafer sort. POCA incurs a low area overhead and is resilient to any attacks known today.</description></item><item><title>Toward Reliable Onboard AI in Space: A Fault-Tolerant Soft GPU-Based System-on-Chip</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11130453</link><description>Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly relevant for space applications, reducing reliance on high-bandwidth downlinks. Its use, however, has primarily been demonstrated in low Earth orbit (LEO) using commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. Extending its use to deep-space and long-duration missions requires computing platforms capable of operating in harsh radiation environments without incurring prohibitive costs. This is particularly important for systems implemented on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), which are widely used in space applications due to their scalability and support for various radiation-hardening profiles. This flexibility makes them preferable to application-specific integrated circuits, whose low production volumes often do not justify their use in space systems. This article details our efforts to develop a novel system-on-chip (SoC) featuring GPU@SAT, a soft graphic processing unit IP provided by IngeniArs S.r.l., with a focus on enhancing its robustness when implemented on the Xilinx radiation-tolerant XQRKU060 FPGA. This approach leverages FPGA reconfigurability and radiation tolerance alongside the high-performance capabilities of graphic processing units (GPUs), unlocking significant potential for accelerating compute-intensive tasks in edge-space applications. Building on this foundation, we employ a classification-based methodology to improve the fault tolerance of GPU@SAT, analyzing trade-offs on performance, power, and area. Additional IP cores, such as a watchdog timer (WDT), a dual RISC-V lockstep with rollback, and the Xilinx Soft Error Mitigation IP, are employed to further improve the SoC robustness. Fault injection on an FPGA prototype targeting essential configuration bits validates the approach, showing a  $15.4\times $  improvement in mean injections before failure over the baseline architecture, with only a  $1.2\times $  increase in hardware complexity.</description></item><item><title>A Time-Domain Integration Comparison Scheme With Noise Immunity for Wake-Up Receivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11123760</link><description>Traditional wake-up receiver (WuRX) systems based on voltage-domain comparators for weak signal detection can readily suffer from false triggering due to noise. To address this issue, this work analyzes the mechanism of noise-induced failure in traditional voltage-domain comparator and proposes a time-domain comparator (TDCMP) scheme based on time-domain integration. By temporally integrating the input signal, the noise immunity of the comparator is significantly enhanced. To suppress process, supply voltage, and temperature (PVT) drift in the TDCMP, this work designs a frequency-locked loop (FLL) that employs a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) isomorphic to the TDCMP&#8217;s voltage-controlled delay line (VCDL) for drift calibration while simultaneously providing the clock signal for the WuRX. Implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process, the core chip area is 0.23 mm2, with a total system power consumption of 20.9 nW. The measurement results demonstrate that the proposed TDCMP enhances the WuRX sensitivity by 4 dB.</description></item><item><title>Camouflaged Logic Gates Using Threshold-Voltage-Defined Memory Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11145962</link><description>This brief proposes two types of camouflaged logic gates using threshold-voltage-defined memory cells (TVD-MCs). The proposed multiplexer-select TVD-MC (MS-TVDMC) gate consists of a target logic gate, several camouflage logic gates, a multiplexer (MUX), and TVD-MCs. All logic gates and MUX are implemented with standard threshold-voltage transistors. The TVD-MC is composed of two cross-coupled inverters with low- or high-threshold-voltage transistors. When its supply voltage increases from ground to  ${V} _{\text {DD}}$ , its data become &#8220;0&#8221; or &#8220;1&#8221; according to the threshold voltages of transistors in two inverters. The target logic gate is selected with the MUX by the data stored in the TVD-MCs. The data are defined by the threshold voltages of transistors, so that it is difficult to distinguish the target logic gate from the other camouflage logic gates. The proposed logic-merged TVD-MC (LM-TVDMC) gate merges all logic gates and MUX in the MS-TVDMC gate at the transistor level. The proposed camouflaged gates significantly reduce the delay, power consumption, and leakage current compared to the conventional dynamic enhanced-TVD (DE-TVD) camouflaged gate requiring the dynamic power and delay overheads and the conventional threshold-voltage-defined (TVD) switch camouflaged gate with large on-resistances in switch transistors.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Challenge Cross-Selection Physical Unclonable Function Based on MRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11134498</link><description>The rapid development of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has triggered massive data transmission. Meanwhile, advances in artificial intelligence (AI) introduce new security vulnerabilities in device interactions. These challenges demand lightweight yet robust security solutions. In this context, physical unclonable functions (PUFs) serve as critical hardware security primitives, enabling reliable authentication for edge devices. Nevertheless, PUF is increasingly susceptible to novel threats, notably machine learning attacks. To address this security vulnerability to attacks, we propose a novel double-layer dynamic challenge cross-selection magnetoresistive random access memory PUF (MPUF). This design leverages the inherent process variation in spin-transfer torque magnetoresistive random access memory (STT-MRAM) as an entropy source. The proposed structure incorporates an obfuscation decode circuit (ODC) that combines xor gates and shift registers. It dynamically obfuscates interlayer relationships between two PUF arrays to enhance circuit nonlinearity. The simulation results demonstrate uniformity of 50.16%, uniqueness of 49.94%, a worst bit error rate (BER) of 2.34% for  $- 25~^{\circ } $ C to  $125~^{\circ } $ C and 1.56% for  $0.5\sim 1.1$  V. In addition, four common machine learning models are used to attack this PUF, achieving accuracies of 50.49%, 50.49%, 50.48%, and 58.41%, which are close to a random guess. Compared with traditional PUF implementations, this work exhibits higher reliability and enhanced security while maintaining low power consumption of approximately 9.975 fJ/bit.</description></item><item><title>A Fast and Energy-Efficient Level Shifter With Complementary Output Buffer for Energy-Constrained Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11132353</link><description>This brief presents a 55-nm level shifter (LS) that enables wide voltage range conversion from 80mV to 1.2V with high energy efficiency and fast transition speed.

The RX employs a quarter-rate clocking architecture to reduce the on-chip clock (CK) frequency and ensure reliable operation under stringent DFE timing constraints. The slicer output is fed back to the DFE weight selection MUX integrated into the second-stage slicer, achieving a short feedback loop latency. In the proposed architecture, the number of stacked transistors in the slicer is reduced to three, thereby reducing the CK-to-Q delay and overall DFE feedback loop latency. This optimized design increases the feedback speed and alleviates DFE timing constraints, ensuring stable operation even at low supply voltages.

The CCCA achieves a high dynamic range (DR) due to its very low noise floor and is implemented with common low-voltage (LV) input devices, while the voltage-boosting power stage achieves a boosted output power ( $P_{\mathrm {OUT}}$ ) with good power efficiency due to its single-stage power delivery. Compared with prior-art CDAs utilizing a capacitive-feedback scheme with two off-chip inductors, this work uses only a single off-chip inductor and has additional output voltage ( $V_{\mathrm {OUT}}$ ) boost capability. The proposed DSVB modulation doubles the effective switching frequency to enhance the LC attenuation, leading to reduced differential-mode electromagnetic interference (EMI) and, unlike typical BD modulation, no modulation-induced common-mode EMI is generated. Compared with the other state-of-the-art LV digital-input CDAs, this work&#8217;s CDA, fabricated using a 0.5- $\mu $ m process, achieves the highest DR of 121.3 dB and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 115 dB, as well as a competitive minimal total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N) of 0.0019%.

We designed for a high tracking bandwidth (BW) of 38 GHz and optimized the SNDR up to the 5th Nyquist zone. This allows covering the targeted Ka-band frequencies of 27&#8211;31 GHz allocated for high-throughput Earth-to-satellite communication without the need for a dedicated mixer, enabling a wideband direct RF sub-sampling receiver approach. We employ an inductor-based input network together with co-optimized push&#8211;pull buffers and an active bootstrapping concept in the critical first track-and-hold (TH) for BW enhancement and improved linearity. Because the focus of this work lies in achieving a high SNDR at multi-ten-GHz inputs rather than maximizing the sampling rate  $f {_{S}}$ , we implement a single 1st-rank TH to eliminate the need for skew and BW mismatch calibration. A prototype of this two-rank TH is implemented in 22-nm FDSOI technology. Measurements of four different chip samples indicate SNDR &gt;39 dB up to 32-GHz input frequency at 12.8-GS/s operation while consuming 87 mW. A sweep of  $f {_{S}}$  from 4.8 to 15.2 GHz and &#177;10% supply variation causes &lt;1.3-dB SNDR fluctuation at a 30.2-GHz input.

The key idea is to operate a Pierce oscillator in a class-C-like fashion, with a digitally defined conduction angle generated based on the current oscillation amplitude. Hence, the XO can start-up when no oscillation is present and boosts its energy efficiency as the oscillation amplitude grows. Two circuit techniques based on the use of charge pumps are proposed in this work to generate this conduction angle information on-chip and regulate the oscillation amplitude. The proposed circuit topology, named the conduction-angle-adaptive XO (CAAXO), is verified through a fabricated integrated circuit (IC) implemented in 28-nm CMOS technology. Measurement results across ten samples demonstrate that under a 0.38-V supply, the proposed circuit functions well across a temperature range of  ${-} 20~{^{\circ } }$ C to  $85~{^{\circ } }$ C while only consuming 0.36 nW of power at  $25~{^{\circ } }$ C room temperature. Furthermore, the proposed CAAXO only occupies 820  $\mu $ m2 of core area, marking it the smallest XO among the state of the art.</description></item><item><title>A 14-b Energy-Efficient BW/Power Scalable CTDSM With a Frequency-Controlled Current Source</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11219048</link><description>This work presents a 14-bit energy-efficient bandwidth (BW)/power scalable continuous-time delta&#8211;sigma modulator (CTDSM) for sensor interfaces in IoT applications. To ensure low noise for small input signals and achieve BW/power scalability, it is built around Gm-C integrators biased via a linear frequency-controlled current source (FCCS). The FCCS enables the integrators to maintain a nearly constant output swing and linearly scalable power consumption across a wide sampling frequency ( $f_{s}$ ) range. Furthermore, multi-bit quantization and dead-band (DB) switches are applied to suppress the nonlinearity of the open-loop Gm-C integrator and DAC transient glitches, respectively. Fabricated in a standard 130-nm CMOS process, it occupies an active area of 0.29 mm2. With an input of &#177;80 mV, the proposed CTDSM demonstrates a nearly constant peak SNDR (~85 dB) and a stable energy efficiency over a  $225\times $  scaling range of  $f_{s}$  under a 0.9-V supply.

It uses a differential first-order RC low-pass filter (LPF) front end to convert parallel-plate capacitance to phase shift, which is further digitized by a high-resolution second-order CT phase-domain (PD) delta&#8211;sigma modulator (CT-PD $\Delta \Sigma $ M). The electrical field interference of the sensor, modeled as a capacitive-coupled charge on the common plate, is rejected by differential-mode readout and built-in bandpass interference filtering of the proposed architecture. To achieve a high temperature stability, the RC filter&#8217;s temperature coefficient (TC) is compensated by driving it using an RC frequency reference with the same temperature dependency.

Especially, the switched-capacitor voltage regulator (SCVR) becomes popular as the second-stage converter owing to its high efficiency and power density. However, the SCVR suffers from poor voltage regulation and limited load capacity. To address these limitations, this article presents a two-stage converter featuring a regulated resonant switched-capacitor (ReSC) second-stage design. Thanks to the resonant operation of the ReSC, the converter achieves the superior power density and load capacity using a compact sub-nano-henry trace inductor. In addition, the resonant operation paves way for the voltage regulation, which is further employed for enhancing transient performances. Finally, to overcome the inherent efficiency versus voltage regulation tradeoff for the ReSC, a collaborative control scheme is built between the first and second stages, which adaptively adjusts the intermediate bus voltage to maintain the ReSC always in the efficient non-regulation mode for the entire output voltage range, leading to a high efficiency for a wide voltage and current range. By employing discrete GaNFETs for the first stage and 65-nm CMOS technology for the ReSC and controller design, the proposed two-stage converter achieves a measured system peak efficiency of 89.3% for 12:1-V conversion. With a 4-A/20-ns load current step, the measured undershoot voltage is 26 mV.</description></item><item><title>A Symbol-Based Power-Tracking Supply Modulator Integrated With a 28-GHz CMOS PA for 5G FR2</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11159181</link><description>This article presents a supply-modulated power amplifier (PA) system architecture for a high-efficiency transmitter (TX) that utilizes a symbol-power-tracking (SPT) technique to support 5G new radio (NR) frequency range 2 (FR2) bands. Conventional analog envelope tracking (ET) supply modulators (SMs) suffer from limited supportable bandwidth due to a decoupling capacitor required at the PA supply node, which makes loop compensation difficult. As a result, analog ET techniques often require complex loop compensation circuits and struggle to meet the stringent specifications of next-generation communication systems. To support wider channel bandwidths, the proposed architecture adopts an SPT supply modulation technique, realized through a single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) dc&#8211;dc converter, enhancing overall SM-PA system efficiency. The full integration of the SM and PA using a single process helps to mitigate voltage overshoot on the PA supply node during fast SPT transitions, contributing to enhanced device reliability and longer lifetime. In addition, an SPT-adaptive biasing scheme is implemented to adjust the PA bias according to the supply voltage, maintaining linearity across multiple supply levels for the PA. The SPT-PA system is fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS process. The SPT modulator achieves a 20-ns/V transition time with nonuniform supply voltage distribution. It supports a 400-MHz 5G FR2 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signal at a 28-GHz PA operating frequency, achieving a 21-mW power saving at a 10-dB power back-off (PBO) level. The die size is 1.5 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 1.52-W Capacitor-Drop Sigma-Floating-SC AC/DC Converter for Grid Power to IoT Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151982</link><description>This work proposes a switched-capacitor (SC)-based non-isolated ac&#8211;dc power converter, converting the ac mains (110V @ 60Hz or 230V @ 50Hz) input to a single-cell battery voltage (3.3&#8211;4.6V), optimized for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and smart home devices.

Piezoelectric (PE) and electromagnetic (EM) transducers are widely used to convert vibration energy into electrical power. While hybrid PE&#8211;EM harvesters can deliver higher output power to support self-sustained systems, existing implementations invariably rely on at least one off-chip inductor for either PE bias-flip or dc&#8211;dc conversion, substantially increasing system volume. This article presents an inductor-less, capacitor-less PE&#8211;EM hybrid energy harvesting platform that eliminates this limitation. By leveraging the inherent phase synchronization between PE and EM sources, the proposed coil-sharing technique enables both bias-flip and dc&#8211;dc conversion without additional passive components, enabling the first fully integrated hybrid energy harvesting system. Fabricated in 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS technology, the prototype delivers dual-regulated outputs at 1.8 and 5 V for multi-domain sensor nodes, achieving a maximum output power of 2.72 mW and a peak end-to-end (E2E) efficiency of 90%. These results highlight the platform&#8217;s potential for ultra-compact, high-performance energy harvesting in next-generation IoT applications.</description></item><item><title>A Shoot-Through-Free 180-MHz Isolated Converter With PG-Downsized PA for Low EMI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11151231</link><description>This article presents a 180-MHz low electromagnetic interference (EMI) isolated dc-dc converter using a  $P_{\mathrm { G}}$ -downsized Class-D power amplifier (PA). This PA features a symmetrical topology that effectively cancels dipole emissions, while its series inductors placed between the cross-connected high-side and low-side transistors that inherently block shoot-through currents. To address the resulting degeneration states of oscillation, we introduce small, actively driven transistors, whereas the original power transistors operate in a passively driven manner, with their gate charge recycled like in a Class-D oscillator. This preserves the advantage of low gate drive loss ( $P_{\mathrm { G}}$ ) in high-frequency oscillators. The frequency misalignment between the switching and oscillation frequencies leads to only minor efficiency degradation. This eliminates the requirement for switching frequency calibration, while enables the low-complexity frequency hopping to further reduce EMI. We fabricated the PA and the receiver (RX) chips using 0.18- $\boldsymbol {\mu }$ m bipolar&#8211;CMOS&#8211;DMOS (BCD) process and attached them with a 14.4-mm $\boldsymbol {^{2}}$  PCB transformer.

The converter achieves always-half-inductor current (AHI) in both directions compared to conventional bidirectional converters (CBCs) while using only 5-V transistors. This enables the elimination of high-voltage (HV) transistors, which have poor on-resistance ( $R_{\mathrm { ON}}$ ) performance and increase process costs. In addition, to address the challenge of varying charging current caused by changes in a battery voltage ( $V_{\mathrm { BAT}}$ ), we propose a normalized inductor current ( $N_{\mathrm { IL}}$ )-based adaptive target current controller that leverages the relationship between the inductor current ( $I_{L}$ ) and output current to effectively regulate the battery charging current ( $I_{\mathrm { BAT}}$ ). By utilizing the proposed controller,  $I_{\mathrm { BAT}}$  adaptively tracks the target charging current regardless of  $V_{\mathrm { BAT}}$ , which varies depending on the state-of-charge.

The proposed design provides two regulated outputs in separate domains in the receiver (Rx) side with a single micro-transformer. These isolated Rxes achieve local voltage regulation and automatic energy distribution across domains through passive magnetic flux sharing (PMFS) without any shared controllers or communication links for coordination. The transmitter (Tx) achieves global power modulation by sensing Rx behaviors through the reflected impedance without using dedicated digital isolators as data links, thus enables closed-loop control with a fast transient response.

The micro-transformer is fabricated in standard flexible-printed-circuit (FPC) with 8 mm diameter and 0.13 mm thickness. The isolation level of the transformer is measured to be &gt;5 kV between Tx and Rx and &gt;3 kV between Rx and Rx. The SLiMDO operation is verified in measurements converting a 3.3-V input from the primary domain to two outputs from 1.8 to 3.3 V each located in separated isolated secondary domains, with a 62.6% peak efficiency at ~600 mW, a 1.13-W maximum power, and a decent load transient response.</description></item><item><title>A Bi-Directional Dual-Path Boost&#8211;Buck Hybrid Converter for High-Voltage Power Transmission Delivery Cable in Humanoid Robots</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11223878</link><description>Humanoid robots have great potential to replace human labors for various tasks in the near future. For a centralized energy storage system in humanoid robots, its battery pack (heart) is located in the main body while the energy is mostly consumed through its legs and hands, demanding thick wires (strong blood vessels) to deliver power to the actuators (muscles). In this work, we present a high-voltage power transmission cable system, which utilizes two bidirectional dual-path boost&#8211;buck (DP-BB) converters and reuses the parasitic cable inductor as the power inductor for a compact and efficient power delivery.

This small capacitance is enabled by its charge-injection digital-to-analog converter (CI-DAC), which maximally exploits the low thermal noise in the cryogenic environment. Despite its small input capacitance, this ADC maintains a high linearity by: 1) implementing a split CI-DAC with a bidirectional charge flow, which keeps the CI-DAC output common mode constant throughout the conversion; 2) by adopting a bottom-plate sampling scheme; and 3) by introducing a static preamplifier in the comparator. The resulting prototype ADC, implemented in a 40-nm bulk CMOS technology, has a core area of only 0.0056 mm2 and a full-scale input swing of 0.84 $V {_{\text {pp,diff}}}$ . It achieves an SNDR of 40.7dB, an SFDR of 64.1dB, and an effective resolution bandwidth (ERBW) of 2.5GHz at a temperature of 6.5K.

The proposed co-design exploits the low-jitter and fine phase resolution of the PLL output to inject energy into the XO precisely at low-impulse-sensitivity-function (ISF) points, enhancing XO performance and subsequently reducing the in-band phase noise of the PLL. In addition, a low-kickback reference buffer is introduced, utilizing a cascoded transistor to mitigate buffer-induced switching kickback and further suppress buffer phase noise. Fabricated in a 22-nm FDSOI process, the prototype occupies an active area of 1.14 mm2, with the pulse-injection driver consuming only 0.014 mm2. The measured integrated jitter from 1 kHz to 100 MHz is 54.5 fsrms at 4.6 GHz, while the reference and second harmonic spurs are &#8722;71 and &#8722;70.4 dBc, respectively. The complete system consumes 7.24 mW, including 1.92 mW for the pulse-injection driver, and achieves a jitter figure-of-merit (FoM) of &#8722;256.7 dB, capturing the combined contributions of the PLL, XO, and reference buffer.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Noise Digital PLL With an Adaptive Common-Mode Resonance Tuning Technique for Voltage-Biased Oscillators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11222624</link><description>This work presents a digital phase-locked loop (PLL) incorporating an adaptive common-mode (CM) resonance tuning technique applied to a voltage-biased digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO). The method leverages the principle that the sensitivity of the oscillator frequency to a dither signal injected into the gate voltage of the cross-coupled transistors diminishes to near zero when the CM resonance is optimally tuned for minimal phase noise (PN). By detecting and nullifying this sensitivity, the proposed technique automatically adjusts the CM resonance to its ideal value. This background operation is continuous across the entire tuning range. The concept was validated through a digital PLL prototype fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, which achieved a jitter of 45.9 fs, a power-versus-jitter figure-of-merit of &#8722;257 dB, and a PN of &#8722;146.6 dBc/Hz at 10-MHz offset from a 4.75-GHz carrier, all within an active area of 0.21 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Jitter Fractional-N Digital PLL Using a Quantization-Error-Compensating BBPD and an Orthogonal-Polynomial-Based LMS Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11183652</link><description>This work presents a 10.0&#8211;11.5-GHz fractional- $N$  digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) using the quantization-error-compensating bang&#8211;bang phase detector (QEC-BBPD) that can minimize both the static delay ( $T_{\mathrm {S}}$ ) and the dynamic delay ( $T_{\mathrm {D}}$ ) required for removing the delta-sigma modulator&#8217;s ( $\Delta \Sigma $ M) quantization-error (Q-error). Since the proposed QEC-BBPD reduces additional thermal noise during the Q-error-compensation process, it allows the DPLL to achieve low in-band phase noise (PN) and low rms jitter. Along with the QEC-BBPD, this work also presents the orthogonal-polynomial-based least-mean-square multivariable calibration (OP-LMS MVC) to accelerate the calibration speed for the removal of the nonlinearities (NLs) of the QEC-BBPD with minimal hardware overhead. The fractional- $N$  DPLL in this work, fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS process, occupied 0.12 mm2 of silicon and consumed 14.4 mW of power.

To enhance the performance of the  $2 {\times } 20~{\mu }$ m GaN high electron mobility transistors (GaN HEMTs), AlN/GaN heterojunction, n+ GaN regrown, and 50-nm floating T-gate are employed with a transconductance of 880 mS/mm and an  ${f} {_{T}}$  ( ${f} {_{\max }}$ ) of 180 GHz (420 GHz). By utilizing multiband large-signal impedance correction technology, the optimal power matching impedance for GaN HEMTs was achieved without the need for a G-band load&#8211;pull testing system. As a result, a 50-nm GaN power amplifier monolithic microwave integrated circuit (PA MMIC) is designed with an output power of 100 mW at 216 GHz and a power density exceeding 1.35 W/mm at 216 GHz. The measured power-added efficiency (PAE) exceeds 2% across the entire frequency band. Furthermore, the circuit-package co-design technique integrates bonding wires, waveguide-to-microstrip transitions, and the packaging cavity into the matching networks of PA MMIC. It minimizes output power and bandwidth degradation due to the packaging parasitics. The presented SSPA module employs 32-way GaN PA MMICs with power combining and delivers &gt;1-W saturated output power across 216&#8211;226 GHz, peaking at 1.54 W at 223 GHz. The power gain exceeds 9 dB and reaches 10.1 dB at 223 GHz.

Switchless Class-G (SLCG) PA has a great potential in the RF bandwidth (BW), but shows limited signal BW and difficulty in parasitics absorption. The situation for Doherty PA (DPA) is exactly the opposite. To combine the merits of SLCG PA and DPA, we propose an SLCG-Doherty-continuum PA (SDCPA), which is constructed by simply inserting a frequency-adaptive transmission line (FATL) into SLCG PA. When the phase shift of FATL deviates from 0&#176; to &#177;90&#176;, SDCPA transfers from SLCG mode to Doherty mode gradually. The theoretical performance of SDCPA is analyzed in depth. Furthermore, a coupled resonator (CR) with inherent parasitics absorption and supply path is proposed to realize broadband FATL on chip. An SDCPA prototype is implemented in a 0.25- $\mu $ m GaN-HEMT process for validation. The fabricated SDCPA achieves a saturated output power of 36.6&#8211;38.6 dBm and a 6-/7.5-dB back-off drain efficiency (DE) of 38%&#8211;56%/37%&#8211;54% from 1.35 to 7.6 GHz with a compact chip size of  $2.1 {\times } 1.6$  mm2. The fractional BW (FBW) is up to 140%. Applying a 100-MHz LTE signal with a 7.5-dB peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), an average DE of 35%&#8211;49.2% is measured over the entire BW, and adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) before and after digital predistortion (DPD) are better than &#8722;25.3 and &#8722;46 dBc, respectively. Applying a 100-MHz 64-QAM signal with a 7.94-dB PAPR, the measured error vector magnitudes (EVMs) without DPD at 1.6/3.6/5.0/6.8 GHz are &#8722;33.5/&#8722;28.3/&#8722;29.4/&#8722;33.7 dB. Moreover, a maximum supported signal BW up to 350 MHz is recorded at 5 GHz. To the best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, the proposed SDCPA demonstrates the largest FBW among all reported integrated back-off efficient PAs without using digital techniques or reconfiguration.</description></item><item><title>CORDIC-Less Digital Polar Transmitter Architecture Based on Delta-Sigma Modulator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11175908</link><description>Conventional digital polar transmitters (TXs) suffer from limited power efficiency and linearity due to the multi-bit nature of intermediate signals. This work proposes a digital polar TX architecture that avoids such drawbacks by reducing the bit count of TX signals. The proposed TX oversamples and quantizes multi-bit I/Q inputs into three-level signals using simple delta-sigma modulators (DSMs), followed by a nine-state lookup table (LUT) to directly generate amplitude modulation (AM) and phase modulation (PM) signals. The complex coordinate rotation digital computer (CORDIC) that is widely used in polar TXs is not required. The AM signal is truncated to two levels for on/off control of an intrinsically linear 1-bit power amplifier (PA). The PA avoids the linearity and switching loss issues of conventional switched-capacitor PAs (SCPAs). The PM signal is represented with 3 bits for eight-phase generation via edge selection from a  $4\times $  carrier local oscillator (LO), which offers better linearity and power efficiency than phase modulators based on multi-bit digital-to-time converters (DTCs). Therefore, the proposed approach enables simultaneous improvements in power efficiency and linearity. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the proposed TX achieves a 33.5% peak power-added efficiency (PAE) at 24.2-dBm output power and supports wideband 50-MSymbol/s 256-quadratic-AM (QAM) signals without digital predistortion (DPD). A maximum system efficiency (SE) of 24.5% is achieved at &#8722;25.1-dB error vector magnitude (EVM), demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art DPD-less digital polar TXs.</description></item><item><title>A Blocker-Tolerant Receiver With VCO-Based Non-Uniform Multi-Level Time-Approximation Filter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11148079</link><description>A blocker-tolerant millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) receiver is presented using a multi-level time-approximation filter (mTAF), a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based integrator with embedded digitization, and non-uniform (NU) sampling to enhance filtering flexibility and efficiency. The mTAF approximates FIR filter responses using a digitally generated multi-level weighting pattern that controls gated integration over time. Compared with state-of-the-art reconfigurable blocker-tolerant receivers, the seven-level mTAF introduces more programmable notches, enables asymmetric filtering, and provides wider stopbands for improved blocker suppression. The VCO-based integrator simplifies circuit complexity and achieves competitive power efficiency compared with conventional Gm-C designs, while NU sampling further mitigates alias-band blockers. Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS, the prototype occupies 0.83 mm2 and consumes 87 mW. The receiver achieves 65-dB maximum blocker rejection, &#8722;36-dB EVM without blockers, and &#8722;31-dB EVM with a 24-dBc blocker at 1.217-GHz offset from a 32-GHz LO.</description></item><item><title>A Millimeter-Wave Direct Digital Transmitter Using Multiphase Subharmonic Switching PA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11162936</link><description>This article presents a direct digital transmitter (TX) employing a multiphase subharmonic switching (MP-SHS) power amplifier (PA) to achieve both high peak and power back-off (PBO) efficiency with wide signal bandwidth.

Furthermore, a dual-rate hybrid digital-to-analog converter (HDAC) is integrated with the MP-SHS TX, which enables noise shaping and lowers in-band error vector magnitude (EVM). A proof-of-concept prototype, fabricated in 65-nm CMOS, operates at 24 GHz, achieving 19.2-dBm peak output power with 38.3% peak power-added efficiency (PAE).

The system integrates eight independent transmitters ( $8~{\times }~1$  TXs) and two four-channel phased-array receivers ( $2~{\times }~4$  RXs), achieving a  $4.76{\times }$  increase in detection range compared to single-input&#8211;single-output (SISO) architecture in long-range radar (LRR) mode and 1.79&#176; angular resolution with  $16 {\times } 4$  virtual array in short-range radar (SRR) mode. To realize a large chirp bandwidth while maintaining low voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) gain ( $K_{\text {VCO}}$ ), a zig-zag phase-locked loop (PLL)-based frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) generator is proposed, enabling continuous multi-subband chirping. By monitoring the voltage across the capacitance in loop filter ( $V_{\text {CAP}}$ ) for subband switching, the tuning voltage ( $V_{\text {TUNE}}$ ) is configured to the optimal switching voltage, eliminating the frequency ripple ( $F_{R}$ ) during subband switching. Each TX channel integrates switches to support a flexible number and positioning of 1&#8211;8 transmitters in TDM mode. To mitigate the leakage effect caused by variations in amplitude and phase due to the varying number and position of TX on-channels, a receiver architecture with three low noise amplifiers (LNAs) and a 4-bit phase shifter is designed to achieve low noise figure (NF) and high linearity. Furthermore, an I/Q mixer is designed to achieve orthogonal-ellipse-overlapping-shape NF and petal-shape linearity over a phase difference range of 0&#176;&#8211; ${360^{\circ } }~{\Delta \phi _{\text {leak}}}$  between the local oscillator (LO) and leakage. The chip achieves a measured maximum chirp bandwidth of 12.6-GHz spanning four zig-zag subbands. The root-mean-square (rms) frequency error is 0.0068% at 18.8-MHz/ $\mu $ s chirp rate with 2.5-GHz bandwidth, and 0.3% at 545-MHz/ $\mu $ s chirp rate with 2.65-GHz bandwidth. The eight-channel TX achieves a maximum effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of 32 dBm at 78.8 GHz, while the four-channel RX achieves a minimum NF of 16.3 dB at a 2-MHz intermediate frequency (IF). The hybrid radar achieves a detection range of 186 m and a range resolution of 3 cm.</description></item><item><title>Fully Integrated Single-Input-Dual-Output Switch-Capacitor DC-DC Converter With Fast DVS Speed and Fast Transient Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11204726</link><description>This paper presents a fully integrated single-input-dual-output (SIDO) switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converter targeting on fast dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) and fast transient response applications.

We demonstrate this using 14nm and 5nm FinFET-based ring oscillators, by collecting data across varying supply voltages, temperatures, and process corners. Using three baseline ML models&#8212;XGBoost, Random Forest, and a Neural Network&#8212;we simulate real-world design scenarios where parameter fine-tuning may not always be feasible. Key tasks include predicting layout performance from schematic data, performance prediction across process corners, and fabricated chip performance. Our results show that these models can achieve less than 5% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for power and frequency prediction while reducing required simulations by more than  $2\times $ . When migrating from 14nm to 5nm, XGBoost and Neural Network achieve high accuracy (&gt;0.99  $R^{2}$ ) using just 10% of the otherwise required 5nm simulations. We also present an extensive robustness analysis to demonstrate that our results are not limited to a single data split or initialization. By varying random seeds across multiple runs, we evaluate the stability of each model with respect to algorithm initialization and the selection of training data subsets. This demonstrates that the observed accuracy is consistent and not the result of a specific, favorable configuration. This framework offers a promising approach to accelerating circuit design across technology nodes by reducing simulation costs while maintaining accuracy in predicting performance.</description></item><item><title>An Integer-N Reference-Double-Sampling PLL for Frequency-Multiplied Octa-Phase Clock Generation Achieving &#8722;251.9 dB FOMJitter-N</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11131491</link><description>This paper presents a reference double-sampling phase-locked loop (RDSPLL) that integrates frequency multiplication and octa-phase clock generation into a single system, significantly reducing power consumption. A differential ring oscillator (DRO) is employed to generate octa-phase clocks with high phase accuracy. The reference double-sampling technique extends the loop bandwidth, effectively suppressing phase noise from the ring oscillator and thereby reducing jitter. To achieve accurate and efficient phase error detection, we proposed a novel offset-compensated hybrid phase detector (OCH-PD), featuring an offset calibration and a comparator-ADC hybrid quantizer. The offset calibration utilizes the CDAC to dynamically compensate for the mismatch in double-sampling, improving jitter and spur performance. The hybrid quantizer supports dynamic mode switching based on different locking states: during the coarse frequency locking phase, it operates in the ADC mode to accelerate the locking process; once a stable lock is achieved, it switches to the comparator mode to enable low-power, high-speed quantization. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the prototype achieves 674 fs RMS jitter at 2.4 GHz while consuming only 3.43 mW, resulting in a  $\text {FOM}_{\text {Jitter-N}}$  of -251.9 dB. With offset calibration, the reference spur at 100 MHz is suppressed from -56 dBc to -80 dBc, and the jitter is reduced from 1.42 ps to 674 fs. The locking time improves from  $10.5~{\mu }$ s to  $1.6~{\mu }$ s using the hybrid quantizer. The eight-phase accuracy remains better than 1&#176; over the frequency range of 2-2.8 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A Compact, Power-Efficient, and On-the-Fly I2C-to-SPI Converter for Distributed E-Textile Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073551</link><description>This paper presents a 0.36-mm2 I2C-to-SPI converter chip designed for electronic textile (E-textile) applications, featuring an on-the-fly conversion scheme that eliminates the need for on-chip data buffers and internal clock generation. By leveraging the synchronous nature of both I2C and SPI protocols, the proposed design forwards each incoming I2C data bit, SDA (Serial Data Line) directly to the SPI output using the I2C serial clock line (SCL), thereby reducing both area and power consumption. Two versions of the chip are proposed: a &#8216;full&#8217; die and a &#8216;compact&#8217; die. The converter enables seamless integration into distributed in-textile architectures by minimizing silicon overhead. The &#8216;full&#8217; die implementation achieves a  $7.33\times $  area reduction compared to commercially available I2C-to-SPI converters, while the &#8216;compact&#8217; version further reduces the footprint by  $14.73\times $  through the use of a small corner seal-ring and a linear pad ring layout. Measurement results confirm robust operation at ultra-fast I2C frequency (5 MHz), consuming only 0.379 mW for the &#8216;full&#8217; die and 0.333 mW for the &#8216;compact&#8217; variant. At standard I2C speeds (400 kHz), the converter demonstrates a  $48\times $  improvement (&#8216;full&#8217; die) in power efficiency over commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solutions, making it an effective and unobtrusive solution for next-generation E-textile systems.</description></item><item><title>A Mode-Reconfigurable Second-Order NS-SAR ADC With NTF Synchronous Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045517</link><description>This paper presents a mode-reconfigurable 2nd-order noise-shaping successive-approximation-register (NS-SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) featured with the ability of optimizing the noise transfer function (NTF) synchronously. Three operation modes, the energy-saving (ES) mode, the normal (NM) mode, and the high-resolution (HR) mode, can be supported by reconfiguring the resolution of the internal SAR ADC (N ${}_{\mathrm {SAR}}$ ) and the oversampling rate (OSR), while the NTF optimization is realized by modulating locations of zeros and poles in the context of a specific mode to enhance the NS effect. The prototype ADC is fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS and operates under a 1.8-V supply. Operating at 5MS/s sampling rate, the ADC&#8217;s OSR can be configured as 8 or 16 in different operation modes, so its bandwidth can be configured as 312.5kHz or 156.25kHz. With NSAR and OSR reconfigured to be 8-bit and 8 for the ES mode, it achieves a signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 80.3dB and consumes  $201\mu $ W. Attributing to the NTF optimization, 27% power saving can be reached in the ES mode with respect to that when the optimization were disabled for the same SNDR. In the HR mode, NSAR and OSR are set to be 9-bit and 16, respectively. And a SNDR of 93.3dB is obtained at the expense of consuming  $280\mu $ W. It is evidenced that the SNDR can be boosted by 6.4dB owe to the NTF optimization, resulting in an optimal SNDR-based Schreier figure-of-merit (FoM ${}_{\mathrm {S}}$ ) of 180.8dB for the ADC. The values for NSAR and OSR are determined to be 9-bit and 8 for the NM mode, and the achievable SNDR is 88.2dB.

Many preclinical studies and clinical applications urgently require a portable, high-quality, low-cost, and fast imaging system. Thus, translating advanced image reconstruction algorithms into hardware implementations is highly desired. However, existing iterative PA image reconstructions, although exhibit higher accuracy than the delay-and-sum algorithm, suffer from high computational cost. In this paper, we introduce a novel model-based hardware architecture for palm-size PA tomography (palm-PAT), aiming at enhancing both the speed and performance of image reconstruction at a much lower system cost. To achieve this, we propose an innovative data reuse method that significantly reduces the consumption of hardware storage resources, achieving a reduction of approximately 75% in hardware storage requirements.

As a candidate to build CiM, static-random-access memory (SRAM) has become popular in accelerating deep neural networks (DNNs) because of its mature fabrication support and high flexibility. However, SRAM-based CiM suffers from low memory density, resulting in frequent weight reloading and increased power consumption during end-to-end inference tasks. Recently, read-only-memory (ROM)-based analog CiM (ACiM) has demonstrated the potential to deploy all DNN weights on-chip by leveraging high-density ROM. It may also achieve encouraging flexibility by exploiting the synergy between a small SRAM and a big ROM. Nevertheless, it faces challenges in achieving high computing density due to limitations in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) performance. Meanwhile, digital CiM (DCiM) improves computing density but incurs significant energy and area overhead due to the adder tree. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the first fully digital and flexible compute-in-read-only-memory (DCiROM) design approach. On the one hand, DCiROM introduces a novel ROM-logic fusion CiM that reduces the CiM area by 51% while maintaining high memory density and computing performance. On the other hand, DCiROM achieves high flexibility with minimal area overhead by proposing two innovative multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) resource-reusing techniques. This work has implemented a DCiROM chip with 3024Kb ResNet-56 parameters using a 65nm CMOS technology. This macro achieves 6.9-29.5x higher normalized FoM (memory density x computing density) than the state-of-the-art CiM works. Additionally, it reduces energy consumption per image inference by 2.9-9.9x compared to SRAM-based CiM works when off-chip access is considered.</description></item><item><title>A Bit-Partitioned Floating-Point 6T SRAM Computing-in-Memory Macro Based on Dual-Edge Time-Domain Structure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11080504</link><description>In the computing-in-memory (CIM) field, floating-point (FP) CIM is afflicted with high computing latency and energy consumption due to the intricate procedures involved in exponent computation and processing. In this work, an 8Kb FP time-domain (TD) static-random-access-memory (SRAM) CIM macro is presented. Fabricated with a 180nm process, this macro exhibits low computational latency and high energy efficiency. A novel FP computing architecture is proposed, which is capable of concurrently executing exponent summation, maximum value finding, difference generation, and mantissa shifting. This architecture effectively reduces the overall delay in exponent computation and processing, thereby enhancing the throughput. Furthermore, a bit-partitioned computing concept and an exponent sparsity scheme are introduced. In this scheme, sparsity judgment is made solely by processing the high 4 bits of the exponent, which significantly reduces power consumption in the remaining exponent computation and processing steps. Additionally, based on the bit-partitioned concept, a dual-edge TD exponent summation and mantissa multiplication-and-accumulation (MAC) circuit is devised. This circuit not only suppresses nonlinear errors during multi-bit computation but also exploits both the rising and falling edges of pulses for computation, thus accelerating the macro&#8217;s operation speed. Compared to previous approaches, an extra 24% power reduction is achieved. At a sparsity level of 90%, a normalized energy efficiency of 14.418 TFLOPS/W and a normalized area efficiency of 0.041 TFLOPS/mm2 are attained. When this work is applied to the ResNet-18 model with BF16 format for input, weight, and output, the accuracy loss on the CIFAR-100 dataset is merely &#8722;0.16%.</description></item><item><title>Booth-Assisted Mixed-Precision Reconfigurable Digital Computing-in-Memory Engine With Ternary-Input 1T2R ReRAM for Edge AI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11128898</link><description>ReRAM has emerged as a promising candidate for computing-in-memory due to its excellent compatibility with advanced CMOS processes, high density, and non-volatility. Meanwhile, Digital Computing-in-Memory (DCIM) offers higher energy efficiency than its analog counterpart and supports full-precision processing. However, existing ReRAM-based DCIMs are hindered by error-prone readout and low input parallelism. The inefficient bit-width reconfiguration also incurs significant hardware overhead during neural network mapping. This paper reports a 64Kb DCIM engine based on 1T2R ReRAM bitcells for multiply-and-Accumulate(MAC) acceleration. The ternary-input Booth-assisted multiply-in-memory (TB-MIM) flow allows bi-state ReRAM with limited readout margin to achieve high-accuracy computation with high parallelism. The corresponding reconfigurable vector adder-tree and accumulator (ReV-A2) effectively facilitate practical hybrid-precision network mapping.

Additionally, this study introduces an innovative image synthesis method, which allows for HDR implementation without any loss of image resolution during the synthesis process. This ensures that the sensor maintains high-resolution imaging quality while adapting dynamically to illumination changes. These innovations allow for fine-grained HDR image synthesis within a single frame, eliminating motion blur and supporting real-time performance in dynamic environments.

However, traditional CIM architectures face challenges such as high resource consumption, especially in data conversion, which can significantly impact chip area and energy efficiency. To address these challenges, this work proposes a computational CIM architecture utilizing multilevel analog memory, named AM-CIM, tailored for near-sensor (NS) computation of real-time KWS applications. Additionally, approximate memory technology is integrated into the AM-CIM architecture, employing data resilience scheduling for analog memory which contributes to significant reductions in hardware overhead. This integration facilitates a hardware-software co-design approach. To deploy KWS tasks in AM-CIM, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) network, referred to as MAC-GRU, is implemented. By employing Mel-energy as the input feature at the near-sensor end, the system achieves a 93.13% reduction in feature extraction power consumption. Evaluation results based on TSMC 180-nm technology demonstrate that the AM-CIM architecture achieves an accuracy of 88.51% for 10-keyword classification with a power consumption of  $546~\mu W$ , while reducing analog memory area by 43.32%.</description></item><item><title>MGARoute: Efficient Analog Routing With Multi-Stage Rip-Up and Rerouting Under Geometric and Symmetry Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051139</link><description>Routing is a critical path-planning challenge in integrated circuit (IC) design, especially in analog IC design, where the complexity of the routing problem increases significantly owing to complex constraints and process parameters.

However, in real circuits, multiple inputs can switch simultaneously, resulting in a significant speed-up. This discrepancy can lead to circuit failures due to inaccurate early analysis, despite static timing analysis (STA) tools adopting conservative strategies. Consequently, multi-input switching (MIS) models have gained importance for timing libraries. For complex logic gates, however, the number of possible transitions that must be considered for characterization increases significantly, posing a substantial challenge in modeling MIS effects. We propose a novel approach to address this challenge by combining the power of satisfiability (SAT) solvers and machine learning (ML) techniques. First, we perform a logical analysis on the Boolean function of a given logic gate to identify input patterns that can lead to MIS-induced speed-up. This task is formulated as a SAT problem, and a SAT solver is utilized to extract all MIS-relevant transitions, thereby significantly reducing the characterization and modeling effort. Next, we leverage ML techniques to accurately capture the complex dependencies of MIS-induced speed-up under various circuit and environmental conditions. To streamline this process, we introduce an automated tool framework named LiMo (Library Model), which integrates a SAT solver, SPICE simulator, dataset optimization strategies, ML training/testing infrastructure, and multiprocessing capabilities to create MIS-aware timing libraries. The results on benchmark circuits reveal that ignoring MIS effects can result in relative root mean square errors (RRMSE) exceeding 40% in timing attributes. In contrast, LiMo-generated libraries achieve RRMSE errors below 7% compared to SPICE simulations, while delivering results  $\sim 10,000 \times $  faster, underscoring their suitability for incorporating MIS effects in STA for industrial designs.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Hybrid Dynamic Event-Triggered Bipartite Consensus Control for Multi-Agent Systems Against DoS Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048444</link><description>This paper addresses the secure bipartite consensus control problem for multi-agent systems under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. A class of aperiodic time-sequence-based DoS attacks is considered, and its impact on both undirected and directed network topologies is analyzed. The stability analysis is conducted using a Lyapunov function approach combined with an iterative method. To reduce energy consumption and prevent Zeno behavior, a hybrid dynamic event-triggered mechanism is introduced. This mechanism incorporates an improved dynamic event-triggering condition, which determines when each agent updates its control signal and transmits its currently triggered state to neighboring agents. The proposed approach integrates this mechanism with the developed distributed control protocol and to ensure bipartite consensus even in the presence of DoS attacks. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through two simulation examples.</description></item><item><title>Autoencoder-Based Transceivers for Multiple Access Human Body Communication Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11054282</link><description>The Internet of Bodies (IoB) represents a transformative technological innovation that merges the bio-physical and digital realms through networks of intelligent devices positioned in, on, and around the human body. Human Body Communication (HBC) offers a promising method for enabling IoB networks, using the human body as a communication channel for multiple wearable nodes. Despite the prevalence of HBC peer-to-peer communication methods in the literature, the challenge of implementing multiple access techniques for HBC at the physical layer remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a new multiple access HBC (MA-HBC) system that leverages autoencoders to design and implement low-power and efficient transceivers sharing a common channel. The proposed MA-HBC system consists of multiple autoencoder-based transceivers trained jointly to optimize overall network performance. It supports various data rates ranging from 164 kbps to 5.25 Mbps, making it suitable for a wide range of IoB applications. To validate the design, a prototype implementation is presented. Additionally, to ensure suitability for wearable devices, a low-power hardware transceiver architecture is provided with an estimated energy efficiency of 105 pJ/b when implemented using TSMC 65nm LP technology. The results show that the proposed MA-HBC system outperforms traditional IEEE 802.15.6 based transceivers for two users with time Sharing, achieving a 3.9 dB improvement in Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) at a block error rate of  $10^{-2}$ .</description></item><item><title>Continuous Flow 4096-Point FFT/IFFT Hardware Architecture for 5G Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11073142</link><description>This paper presents a high-throughput, low-latency 4096-point FFT/IFFT hardware design tailored for 5G applications.

The desired features of a theoretical framework for DPs are heavily inspired on classical phasor theory: the ability to transform time differential equations into equivalent algebraic complex equations, while maintaining the familiar notions of phasors, magnitudes and phases, and describing instantaneous power by two components, active and reactive power. Current frameworks rely on integral transforms which need approximations and truncations to allow for practical computation and application and do not offer a theory of nonstationary power. Further, the integral transforms are difficult to operate with and are not suitable to transform any generic nonstationary signal due to convergence requirements and frequency resolution challenges. This paper presents a new theoretical framework for DPs, based on differential operators, that offers a natural and efficient framework to transform nonstationary sinusoidal signals into Dynamic Phasors, while also offering a solid theory on nonstationary power extending the conventional well defined active and reactive power definitions.</description></item><item><title>Online Distributed Convex Optimization for Unbalanced Varying Graphs With Delayed Feedback</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11081829</link><description>Feedback signal delays present a common challenge in the online decision-making processes of various real-world systems, such as real-time economic dispatch in power systems. These delays, primarily induced by limited computational capabilities or unknown parameter changes, can significantly hinder the performance or even effectiveness of online decision-making strategies. This study investigates distributed optimization over time-varying unbalanced networks with delayed feedback signals. We propose discrete-time distributed online algorithms for both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems. Each node in the network has access only to its individual time-varying local objective function with a delayed time sequence. At each decision-making step, each node selects the appropriate local online behavior, which depends on the information from its neighbor nodes, towards the minimization of global cumulative cost function value. We demonstrate that sublinear regrets can be ensured as long as the time-varying unbalanced communication networks maintain  $\mathcal {B}$ -strong connectivity. For a general convex or  $\mu $ -strongly convex local objective function, the network regret and individual regret grow as  $\mathcal {O}((\ln (T))^{2})$  and  $\mathcal {O}(\sqrt {T})$ , respectively, and are intrinsically related to the feedback delays and step sizes. To validate the proposed algorithms, numerical studies are carried out on constrained distributed time-varying economic dispatch problems.</description></item><item><title>Constant Voltage Regulation of Delayed Inductive Power Transfer Systems: A Data-Driven Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048450</link><description>This paper delves into the constant voltage output regulation problem for delayed inductive power transfer (IPT) systems with linear matrix inequality region constraints.

Ever increasing interface speed has resulted in multi-phase clock distributions (e.g., half-rate, quarter-rate architecture) becoming a reality over single / complementary phase clock distribution for performance reasons. Conventional techniques of clock distribution often involve distributing multi-phase clocks in pairs of complementary clock phases with proper shields around these phases to avoid coupling with other non-complementary clock phases of multi-phase clock distribution. However, these schemes suffer heavily when speeds/datarates and routing length of clock distribution increase. A mutually coupled multi-phase clock distribution scheme is proposed that overcomes signal integrity issues observed in the conventional multi-phase clock distribution scheme. Two schemes, correct by design (CD) and correct by layout (CL) are proposed to boost performance over conventional methods. Mutual coupling is effectively used between N-phase clocks and matched clocks are distributed with minimal/zero power overhead. Implemented in 7nm FinFET technology, the proposed schemes improve clock swings by ~4.75%-8%, random jitter (RJ) by ~4%-10%, rise/fall times by 10%-23% and achieve perfect matching between N phases of the clock.</description></item><item><title>A 31.25 MHz Bandwidth 52.4 dB SNDR VCO-Based ADC With on-Chip Non-Linearity Correction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11054050</link><description>This brief presents a method for correcting nonlinearities in voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) based analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).

However, achieving this promise has remained elusive due to the lack of suitable training algorithms. Analog memory devices exhibit asymmetric and nonlinear switching behavior in addition to device-to-device variation, meaning that most, if not all, of the current off-the-shelf training algorithms cannot achieve good training outcomes. Recently introduced algorithms have attracted limited attention, as they require bi-directionally switching devices of unrealistically high symmetry and precision and are highly sensitive. A new algorithm, chopped TTv2 (c-TTv2), has been introduced, which leverages the chopped technique to address many of these challenges. In this brief, we evaluate the accuracy and the performance of the c-TTv2 algorithm for analog TL using ResNet and Swin-ViT models, pre-trained on the CIFAR10 dataset, on a fine-tuning task using two subsets of the CIFAR100 dataset. We also investigate the robustness of our algorithm to changes in some device and circuit non-idealities, including weight transfer noise, write noise, symmetry point skew, symmetry point variability, pulse update noise, mean pulse response, device-to-device variability, the number of states, output noise, I/O resolution, and the minimum and maximum conductance device-to-device variability. We demonstrate that the c-TTv2 algorithm mostly surpasses the performance of analog/digital training and narrows the performance gap between analog and digital TL while being robust to changes in device and circuit non-idealities.</description></item><item><title>Smart Watchdog for RISC-V: A Novel Spiking Neural Network Approach to Fault Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051055</link><description>Watchdog mechanisms must detect permanent and transient faults with minimal power and area overheads, but their own reliability is vital, as failures can jeopardize system integrity. This brief introduces a novel smart watchdog paradigm based on spiking neural networks (SNNs), where SNNs have previously been demonstrated to offer low-power and area-efficient solutions.

Accurate prediction of nonlinear distortion is essential for making design trade-offs between output power and network throughput. We use the series form of the characteristic function (ch.f.) method to predict distortion spectra for sparse multi-carrier transmissions. This method results in efficient calculations of individual signal and distortion components. The method is validated both theoretically and practically. Theoretical validation is performed by modeling the signal as a bandpass Gaussian process that is hard limited, and it is shown that the series ch.f. method produces results that are identical with the classical Price&#8217;s theorem. Practical validation is shown by considering an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal with a fragmented spectrum which is then applied to an amplifier driven into compression for which application of Price&#8217;s theorem is difficult, and the predicted output spectrum corroborates laboratory measurements. Part of the computational efficiency is realized in that the nonlinearity can be expressed as the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of samples of its forward scattering parameter (i.e., S21) or transconductance function (including AM-PM effects), and distortion contributions of the signal can be expressed as numerical autoconvolutions of the clean spectrum. Signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) can be easily computed and parameterized across variables of interest, such as overdrive level.</description></item><item><title>A 12-MHz GaN-Based DC&#8211;DC Buck Converter Featuring Dual Reverse Conduction Controllers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11215820</link><description>This brief presents a 12-MHz 30V-to-12V GaN-based DC-DC buck converter incorporating a high-efficiency gate driver IC with dual (high-side and low-side) reverse conduction controllers (RCCs).

Traditional pipelining techniques distributing the computation across different on-chip processing units, while effective for throughput, do not address the latency demands posed by modern neural networks with complex interdependencies and extensive operator parallelism. There is a potential in leveraging operator parallelism to enable concurrent execution across multiple processing units, thereby reducing inference latency. However, prioritizing pipelining or parallel execution often necessitates a compromise, where optimizing one performance metric adversely impacts the other. This article introduces Para-Pipe, a hierarchical mapping framework that integrates intra- and interstage operator parallelism within a pipelined architecture. Para-Pipe navigates the tradeoff between throughput and latency by selectively fine-tuning parallelism levels within and across pipeline stages. This strategy can significantly reduce interprocessor communication overhead, significantly improving energy efficiency. Our evaluation demonstrates that Para-Pipe generates multiple Pareto-optimal configurations, achieving a balance between throughput and latency on an Amlogic SoC equipped with ARM big.LITTLE CPUs and GPU, as well as the Black Sesame Technology SoC featuring a deep learning accelerator and two DSPs. More importantly, throughput-optimized configurations under Para-Pipe on Amlogic SoC show an average energy efficiency improvement of 11.0% over purely pipelined strategies and 23.3% relative to nonpipelined parallel execution.</description></item><item><title>Mitigating Computation Errors of In-RRAM Computing Through Network Retraining With IR-Drop and Data Allocation Effects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982297</link><description>In recent years, In-RRAM Computing (IRC) has been a promising technique for deep neural network (DNN) applications. Combined with the proper pruning technique, the cost and energy of DNN computation can be further reduced. However, IRC often suffers from accuracy issues due to the nonideal effects in RRAM arrays, such as the sneak path and IR-drop, as well as its data allocation. To mitigate those nonideal effects, network retraining with extra error injection is often adopted to alleviate the accuracy degradation of IRC designs in the real environment. Conventional random disturbance and equation-based approaches did not consider the data allocation issue, which may incur larger errors for the sparse matrix generated by data pruning techniques. In this article, a fast and accurate IR-drop model is proposed to reflect the data-dependent effects, which is able to offer accurate error injection in the DNN training phase with sparse matrixes. As shown in the experimental results, the proposed simple model is successfully integrated into the network retraining flow with little overhead, which helps to alleviate the computation errors of IRC designs in the real environment.</description></item><item><title>A Sub- 10 &#956;s In-Memory-Search Collision Detection Accelerator Based on RRAM-TCAMs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002546</link><description>Collision detection can account for over 90% of the total calculation time in motion planning, which makes it critical to optimize the collision detection process. Previous hardware accelerators can hardly maintain fast computation speed for real-time collision detection while supporting a large roadmap. In this work, we present a novel in-memory-search accelerator. The accelerator achieves an impressive sub- $10~\mu $ s time for collision detection in 800-MB scale roadmaps with 100000 edges. Such accelerator leverages an in-memory-search architecture that can perform search operation in massively parallel manner with low energy consumption. It is powered by ternary content-addressable memories (TCAMs) based on large-scale nonvolatile resistive random-access memory (RRAM) arrays, which not only store a large roadmap on chip, perform look-up table function in a single clock cycle to accelerate collision detection by combining with the unique logic encoding scheme. Importantly, the RRAM-based TCAM eliminates the need for extensive data transfer between memory and computing units during collision detection, leading to significant energy and delay saving. As the pioneering TCAM-based in-memory-search accelerator for collision detection, the structure achieves 210&#8211; $2225\times $  times speedup compared with previous application-specific integrated circuit-based accelerators, and more than 33 $879\times $  times speedup compared with CPU-based collision detection. Such accelerator well exceeds the speed requirement for collision detection (&lt;1 ms), and is suitable for a number of applications, such as robot motion planning in dynamic environment, animation, machining and manufacturing.</description></item><item><title>Denoise on Sensor: A Near-Sensor Compute-in-Memory Macro for Visual Perception Denoising via Concatnation-Eliminating</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11004071</link><description>Noise is one of the most common and significant factors leading to image degradation. In recent years, due to the rapid development of neural networks, the performance of denoising algorithms has seen a substantial improvement. However, state-of-the-art denoising models often entail large-scale models and heavy computational requirements, making deployment challenging. In addition, we have observed that the location of denoisers in the entire image processing pipeline has a significant impact on resource consumption and denoising effectiveness. Deploying the denoiser closer to the image acquisition stage will be more effective in separating noise from the image. In this article, we propose a near-sensor compute-in-memory macro for visual perception denoising (Denoise on Sensor, DoS) along with its corresponding Edge Denoise U-net (EDU) architecture. DoS employs a mixed-signal circuit implementation for neural network inference, offering a notable advantage in terms of high speed and low power consumption compared to FPGA- or GPU-based approaches, making it feasible to deploy denoising tasks at the near-sensor edge. The simulation results show that the energy efficiency of DoS can reach 21.98 TOPS/W, and EDU deployed on DoS can achieve around 30 dB PSNR and 0.83 SSIM on KODAK, BSD300 and SET14 datasets.</description></item><item><title>Synthesis of a CNTFET-Based Ternary Full Adder Using a Carry-Less Ternary Half Adder</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003064</link><description>The full adder (FA) is an essential element within arithmetic units, significantly contributing to their computational efficiency. Contemporary research endeavors are actively exploring optimized FA circuit designs. The integration of carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNTFETs) and multiple-valued logic (MVL) in circuit implementations holds great promise for achieving exceptional performance gains. This article proposes novel complete and partial ternary FA (TFA) architectures utilizing 76 and 55 CNTFETs, respectively, realized through a streamlined design methodology. The design strategically incorporates a proposed carry-less ternary half adder to compute the sum of the primary inputs. The resulting sum output then serves as a control signal in both TFA configurations. The TFA circuits are further implemented utilizing three unary operators, transmission gates, and pass transistor logic. HSPICE simulation results, conducted using Stanford 32-nm CNTFET technology at a  $V_{DD} \; {=} \; 0.9$  V, demonstrate that the proposed complete TFA design outperforms its counterparts with a 24.24% improvement in delay, a 5.81% reduction in power consumption, and a 28.71% decrease in energy consumption. Meanwhile, the proposed partial TFA offers 19.13% faster operation, 14.4% lower power consumption, and 30.74% better energy efficiency. The superiority of the proposed complete TFA is further substantiated through the creation of a three-trit ripple-carry adder.</description></item><item><title>VariPar: Variation-Aware Workload Partitioning in Chiplet-Based DNN Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993501</link><description>Chiplet-based DNN accelerators have been extensively explored to save design and manufacturing costs. Previous works regard all chiplets as identical and employ uniform workload partitioning strategies. These workload partitioning strategies overlook various real-world factors that contribute to remarkable performance variations among chiplets, including manufacturing process variation, thermal condition, physical placement, and power supply condition. When considering these performance variations, a variation-aware workload partitioning can achieve superior performance. This article introduces VariPar, a systematic framework to employ variation-aware partitioning strategy in chiplet-based DNN accelerators. VariPar models performance variations for each chiplet and partition workloads accordingly. VariPar includes a simulator with multifactor variation modeling and a heuristic search engine to generate near-optimal partitioning within a reasonable time. Experiment results show that VariPar achieves  $1.45{\times }$  performance and  $1.82{\times }$  energy efficiency improvement on average when compared to uniform partitioning (UP) strategy.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Interconnect on Ferroelectric FinFET-Based Logic-in-Memory Circuits at 3-nm Technology Node</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11007562</link><description>This study delves into the impact of interconnects on ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET) devices, employing ferroelectric materials in the gate stack for nonvolatile memory at the 3-nm technology node. Specifically, the study investigates the impact of interconnect on logic-in-memory (LiM) circuits. As the impact of interconnect become more pronounced at sub-nanometer scales, they are known to have a significant influence on circuit characteristics beyond the intrinsic properties of the components. Leveraging a newly developed path-finding process-design-kit (PDK), encompassing FeFET characteristics and interconnect properties, we explored various circuit configurations, such as full-adder (FA) and ternary content-addressable memory (TCAM). Our investigation revealed that FeFET-based LiM circuits offer advantages in area, propagation delay, and power consumption compared to traditional CMOS-based circuits. While interconnects still influence FeFET-based circuit characteristics, their impact is somewhat tempered in comparison. We meticulously quantified these impacts. The simulation of how the next generation of advanced interconnect processes can further enhance FeFET-based LiM circuit performance was conducted using the PDK. Through this analysis, we proposed guidelines for the layout design of future FeFET-based LiM circuits.</description></item><item><title>An Ultraspeed Middle Voltage and Timing Analyzer With Near-SPICE Accuracy for Charge-Recycling Buses</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994426</link><description>By stacking two data channels between  $V_{DD}$  and  $V_{SS}$ , charge recycling buses (CRBs) halve the voltage swing on interconnects, achieving significant power savings for energy-efficient on-chip data transmission. However, the middle voltage ( $V_{MID}$ ) between the two channels may fluctuate dynamically due to the diversity of input data, which significantly impacts data propagation delay and reliability. Unfortunately, existing SPICE-based simulators do not run fast enough to identify the worst-case  $V_{MID}$  fluctuation and propagation delay, posing great challenges in CRB design. In this article, we present a dedicated CRB Simulator for fast and accurate  $V_{MID}$  and timing analysis. A highly condensed  $V_{MID}$  fluctuation model, which integrates each cycle&#8217;s  $V_{MID}$  changes into a single closed-form formula, is embedded in the simulator to predict  $V_{MID}$  values at clock edges. In addition, a speed-monitoring algorithm is developed to track the continuously changing signal propagation speed under intracycle  $V_{MID}$  fluctuations for accurate delay estimation. Both the  $V_{MID}$  fluctuation model and the delay estimation algorithm involve only a small number of arithmetic operations, thus featuring remarkably low computational complexity. Compared with HSPICE, our CRB Simulator runs &gt; $1.0\times 10^{5} $  times faster on average across various CRB circuits, with a  $V_{MID}$  prediction error of only 1.3 mV and a delay estimation error as low as 0.6%. The significant speed improvement combined with high accuracy makes our CRB Simulator an efficient and reliable solution for  $V_{MID}$  and timing analysis in CRB circuit design.</description></item><item><title>Theseus: Exploring Efficient Wafer-Scale Chip Design for Large Language Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981855</link><description>The emergence of the large language model (LLM) poses an exponential growth of demand for computation throughput, memory capacity, and communication bandwidth. Such a demand growth has significantly surpassed the improvement of corresponding chip designs. With the advancement of fabrication and integration technologies, designers have been developing wafer-scale chips (WSCs) to scale up and exploit the limits of computation density, memory capacity, and communication bandwidth at the level of a single chip. Existing solutions have demonstrated the significant advantages of WSCs over traditional designs, showing potential to effectively support LLM workloads. Despite the benefits, exploring the early-stage design space of WSCs for LLMs is a crucial yet challenging task due to the enormous and complicated design space, time-consuming evaluation methods, and inefficient exploration strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Theseus, an efficient WSC design space exploration framework for LLMs. We construct the design space of WSCs with various constraints considering the unique characteristics of WSCs. We propose efficient evaluation methodologies for large-scale NoC-based WSCs and introduce multifidelity Bayesian optimization to efficiently explore the design space. Evaluation results demonstrate the efficiency of Theseus that the searched Pareto optimal results outperform GPU cluster and existing WSC designs by up to 62.8%/73.7% in performance (with the same or lower power) and 38.6%/42.4% in power consumption (with the same or higher performance) for LLM training, while improving up to  $23.2\times $  and  $15.7\times $  for the performance and power of inference tasks. Furthermore, we conduct case studies to address the design tradeoffs in WSCs and provide insights to facilitate WSC designs for LLMs.</description></item></channel></rss>
