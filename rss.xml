It is found that compared with the ideal CLLC resonant converter without considering drain-source capacitance, a tiny drain-source capacitance would lead to a significant reduction in the voltage boost gain within the below-resonant region. Moreover, the influence of drain-source capacitance on boost-gain reduction increases with the increasing resonant frequency and drain-source capacitance of the converter. It indicates that the effect of the drain-source capacitance must be taken into consideration when designing the resonant frequency and resonant tanks of the CLLC resonant converter. This work facilitates the understanding of the operating principle and voltage gain characteristics of CLLC resonant converters, and provides the knowledge base with new rules and methods for parameter design of the CLLC resonant converter. Detailed theoretical analysis has been carried out, and the influence of drain-source capacitance has been verified with both simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Single-Driver Series-Parallel IGBTs Solid State Circuit Breaker Component</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11052878</link><description>Solid-state dc circuit breaker (SSCB) has become a key component for fast fault isolation in high-voltage dc systems. However, their effectiveness often relies on complex series and parallel connections of numerous switches. To address the low flexibility and redundancies problems inherent in conventional circuit breakers, this article proposes a single-drive series&#8211;parallel insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) all-solid-state dc circuit breaker component (SCBC). The innovative approach can precisely control multiple series and parallel IGBTs by using only one gate driver and a small number of passive components. In this novel configuration, a shutdown signal triggers the first-stage IGBTs. Once activated, the energy storage capacitor causes the subsequent IGBTs to shut down continuously. In SCBC, the main switches are connected in series and parallel, the breaking current capability is improved. In particular, the componentized design concept makes the topology is extensible and enhances the flexibility of SSCBs. Finally, the operating principle and design guidelines of SCBC are illustrated in detail through the creation of a mathematical model and topology, and their effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation and experimentation.</description></item><item><title>Direct Synthesis Based Centralized PI Controller Design for Single Inductor Multioutput (SIMO) Buck Converter to Alleviate Cross Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11059999</link><description>The main control challenge in the single inductor multioutput buck converter (SIMOBC) is the cross-regulation in the output voltages. To alleviate this cross-regulation, a centralized frequency domain PI controller design methodology based on direct synthesis for SIMOBC is presented. In this method, the controller parameter is evaluated by comparing the closed loop transfer function (CLTF) matrix of the SIMOBC model with the desired CLTF matrix. The desired CLTF is considered as a diagonal matrix to achieve no cross-regulation in the output voltages. The diagonal element of the desired CLTF matrix is selected to have the desired closed-loop dynamics of the individual output of the SIMOBC. The controller is further approximated as a PI controller by frequency response matching at low frequency point. To validate the proposal, two cases are considered, i.e., single inductor dual output and single inductor three output buck converter. The performance of the proposed scheme is investigated using both MATLAB simulations and hardware experiments involving both the converters. Results verify the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Minimum Loss Trajectory Modulation for Single-Stage SR-DAB Based DC/AC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11058464</link><description>Single-stage dc/ac converter is increasingly adopted in photovoltaic inverters, energy storage systems and electric vehicle chargers due to its high flexibility, high efficiency and low cost. This article introduces a minimum loss trajectory modulation strategy for single-stage SR-DAB based dc/ac converter. By establishing the precise model for the loss of the converter, the operation efficiency is optimized in a 2-D optimization procedure. The two operation modes of the optimized trajectory handle the heavy load and light load operating modes, respectively, which can achieve the highest converter efficiency in the 50-Hz grid cycle. In addition, to solve the problem caused by the discontinuous modulation variables, a seamless mode switching strategy is proposed. An 500-W prototype is implemented, with rated voltage of 48 V on dc side and 220-Vrms on ac side. Experimental results validate the theoretical analysis and the practical feasibility of proposed modulation strategy.</description></item><item><title>An LLC Resonant Converter With Symmetric Pulse-Width Balancing and Fixed-Period Hysteresis Burst Control for High Efficiency Over Full Load Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11028878</link><description>This article presents a high-efficiency LLC resonant converter with an integrated controller. To speed up the transient response, hybrid hysteresis charge (HHC) control is applied. However, identical ramp currents for control compensation pose challenges in precise current matching, leading to output current discrepancies and reduced device lifespan. Furthermore, LLC converter efficiency declines under light load conditions due to increased switching losses. To address the above problems, the proposed controller operates in three modes: high power mode (HPM), low power mode (LPM), and ultralow power mode. HHC control combined with an innovative symmetric pulsewidth balancing technique for accurate ramp compensation currents matching is used in HPM. Fixed-period hysteresis burst control is applied in LPM while minimizing audible noise. An ultralow power mode is incorporated to maintain performance under ultralight load conditions. Experimental results from a prototype converter with an input voltage range from 365 ${V}_{\mathrm{DC}}$ to 410 ${V}_{\mathrm{DC}}$, an output voltage of 24 ${V}_{\mathrm{DC}}$, and an output power range from 2.4 W to 240 W demonstrate a peak efficiency of 95.37% at an output current of 5 A and an input voltage of 410 V. At an ultralight load of 0.1 A with an input voltage of 365 V, the circuit remains 89.05% efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Active Fault-Tolerant Control for Three-Level T-Type Converter With Unbalanced Neutral-Point Voltage Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11024150</link><description>The rectifier and inverter in the T-type back-to-back converter are interconnected via a capacitance with a dc-link midpoint. Faults in the inverter switches of the converter will result in current distortion, load power loss, and dc voltage unbalance, which subsequently impact rectifier operation and grid power quality. While many studies have focused on achieving complete inner switch fault tolerance in three-level inverters, outer switch faults have typically required additional redundant hardware elements or modifications to control references to reduce output voltage amplitude. This article proposes an active fault-tolerant control (FTC) method for three-level T-type converters with unbalanced neutral-point (NP) voltage modulation to tolerate outer switch faults. The rectifier actively induces the unbalanced NP voltage by injecting zero-sequence components and providing sufficient dc voltage support for the inverter&#8217;s voltage synthesis. The inverter&#8217;s separated phase FTC uses healthy legs to achieve the faulty phase voltage synthesis and injects zero-sequence components to fully exploit the dc voltage. This active FTC method avoids the use of faulty switches, maintaining normal converter operation. Hardware-in-the-loop testing results demonstrate that the output ac current harmonics are less than 5% and the dc voltage ripples are less than 4%, verifying that the FTC achieves higher performance under various load conditions.</description></item><item><title>Single-Phase and Evaporating Two-Phase Flow Microchannel Cooling of Power Modules for Temporary Overcurrent Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029139</link><description>Evaporating two-phase flows are usually avoided in cooling applications due to the potential inception of flow instabilities, which result in worse cooling performance. However, the substantial latent heat of liquid evaporation presents a compelling source in power electronics cooling when temporary overcurrent is needed. In this study, we utilise water evaporation to enhance the cooling performance under temporary module overcurrent conditions, while the water remains in its liquid phase during nominal operation. The proof-of-concept is demonstrated for a Si IGBT/diode half-bridge module cooled with a microchannel array integrated below the direct bonded copper ceramic. The microchannel cooling solution is evaluated in terms of reduction in the junction-to-case thermal resistance and of an increase in the temporary overcurrent capability. The thermal resistance is extracted for different flow rates using Simcenter Micred Power Tester. Infrared and visible spectrum cameras are used to simultaneously record the junction temperature and the evaporating flow in the microchannel array. Flow regimes with parts of individual channels occupied by the flow of vapor have been observed in the overcurrent duration, resulting in heat transported downstream from the chip location, where liquid evaporates, to the outlet of the manifold. Results indicate that evaporation enhances the cooling performance for the tested conditions, with no signs of boiling crisis in the microchannel flow.</description></item><item><title>Frequency-Domain Modeling of Electrical Insulation and Application to High-Voltage Power Electronics: A Review</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051010</link><description>Modern power applications, such as high-voltage direct current transmission, electrified transportation, and industrial systems, increasingly rely on wide-bandgap semiconductors, driving the need for electrical insulation systems capable of withstanding high electric fields and switching voltage waveforms.

However, one potential problem is that the dc-side total capacitor ripple current (TCRC) is considerable, which induces capacitor heating and compromises converter reliability. This article presents a Fourier analysis based dual phase-optimized strategy that considers the constraints of phase shift angle (PSA) in DAB converter, aiming to minimize the root mean square (rms) of the lowest frequency harmonic current (LFHC) in TCRC. First, a mathematical model is developed for the single phase (1P) converter, comprising a frequency domain analytical expression of the ripple current and the PSA adjustable range of 1P converter. Subsequently, using the developed model, the initial phase relationships among the three 1P converters are adjusted at the minimum symmetrical interval (30&#176;) of the power grid cycle. Concurrently, the PSA of converters are dynamically optimized at each switching cycle, thereby achieving maximal attenuation of the LFHC. Experimental validation using a 3&#215;1.1-kW prototype demonstrates a 90% reduction in the rms of the LFHC under rated conditions.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced Observer With Series-Correction for Active Disturbance Rejection Control in DAB Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11023614</link><description>The power supply for pulsed power loads demands exceptional dynamic performance, requiring fast and precise regulation of the output voltage. Active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) with a linear extended state observer (LESO) stands out among control strategies due to its model independence and simplified parameter design. A crucial element of ADRC is the LESO, which effectively tracks total disturbances with limited system information. However, the LESO&#8217;s tracking speed is constrained by the crossover frequency, and it exhibits significant steady-state errors when disturbances take the form of ramp, acceleration, or sinusoidal function. To enhance the speed and accuracy of disturbance tracking, a series-correction-based LESO incorporating an incomplete differential proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is proposed for an ADRC-controlled dual active bridge (DAB) converter. The proposed optimized LESO offers a faster dynamic response and smaller steady-state errors compared to traditional LESO. Additionally, the article addresses system stability and parameter optimization for the improved converter. The effectiveness of the optimized LESO design is validated using a 500W DAB experimental prototype, demonstrating excellent dynamic response and low susceptibility to parameter variations.</description></item><item><title>Characterization of Impedance and Stability for Doubly-Fed Induction Generator Based on Voltage-Modulated Direct Power Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029154</link><description>Voltage-modulated direct power control (VM-DPC) applied to the doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) offers superior steady-state and transient performance but remains underexplored for suppressing wideband oscillations. This article proposes a comprehensive impedance for the VM-DPC-based DFIG, analyzing its impedance characteristics and stability mechanisms compared with the DFIG based on vector-oriented control (VOC). The unified power transfer function is defined for DFIGs employing VM-DPC or VOC to ensure consistent comparison benchmarks. The comprehensive impedance of VM-DPC-based DFIG, incorporating mechanical and grid-side converter (GSC) dynamics, is derived using complex vector modeling in the $\alpha \beta$-frame. Furthermore, the influence of VM-DPC parameters and grid strength on the stability of grid-connected DFIG systems is assessed through eigenvalue trajectory analysis. Impedance analysis reveals the significant contributions of mechanical and GSC dynamics to DFIG impedance, as well as the narrower frequency range of negative resistance in the VM-DPC-based DFIG compared to the VOC-based DFIG. Stability analysis identifies the VM-DPC parameters of the rotor-side converter as dominant factors affecting system stability and confirms that the VM-DPC-based DFIG achieves better stability under weak grid conditions than its VOC-based counterpart. These findings are validated through simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Fault-Tolerant Multiport Quadruple Active Bridge Converter for Resilient Interconnection of Bipolar DC Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029183</link><description>In this article, a fault-tolerant quadruple-transformer quadruple-active-bridge (QT-QAB) converter is proposed for resilient interconnection of bipolar dc systems. During normal operation, the proposed QT-QAB can achieve power balancing at both high-voltage (HV) and low-voltage (LV) bipolar systems. In the event of a monopolar short-circuit fault, the QT-QAB can isolate the faulty pole on the LV side. As a result, the HV bipolar dc system and the LV healthy pole can maintain an uninterrupted power supply during the LV short-circuit fault. The circuit parameter design and control strategy are analyzed with consideration of zero-voltage-switching soft switching, bipolar balancing, and fault isolation capability. The proposed topology is compared with traditional QAB, DAB, and HFB-QAB topologies in terms of current stress, efficiency, and cost. Based on comparative simulations and experimental results, the bipolar balancing and fault-tolerant operation capabilities of QT-QAB are validated.</description></item><item><title>Magnetic Integration With Controllable Leakage Inductance and Unbalanced Current Suppression for CF DAB Converter Based on Single EE Core</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11028887</link><description>A magnetic integrated structure based on single EE core (SEEC) is proposed to integrate all magnetic elements in current-fed dual active bridge (CF DAB) converter to improve power density. Different from previous works, all magnetic components of CF DAB, including two dc inductors, a transformer and a leakage inductance, are integrated in a SEEC. Moreover, the parameters of inductances and turns ratio can be accurately controlled by designing the number of winding turns and the air gap length. Furthermore, the unbalanced current suppression performance of the two interleaved dc inductors for CF DAB is improved due to the natural negative coupling between the two outer leg windings of the SEEC. In addition, based on the SEEC structure, an SEEC DAB converter is derived. Finally, the validity of the proposed solutions is verified by simulated results from Maxwell finite-element analysis and experimental results from a 1-kW laboratory prototype. Compared with CF DAB, the power density and efficiency are improved by 71% and 2.14%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Dual-Channel Gate Driver With Short-Circuit Protection for Series-Connected Medium-Voltage SiC MOSFETs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11031131</link><description>The dual-channel gate driver (D-GD) is widely employed in the industry to support the extensive adoption of half-bridge power modules. With the growing popularity of silicon-carbide (SiC) devices in medium-voltage (MV) scenarios known for their superior switching performance compared to traditional silicon counterparts, this article proposes a comprehensive D-GD design tailored for MV SiC mosfet half-bridge power module. To overcome the constraints imposed by the limited voltage ratings of power devices in high-voltage applications, unlike the traditional D-GD that operates by switching the two devices complementarily, the proposed D-GD is designed to switch them synchronously, aggregating the half-bridge module into a single device with doubled voltage rating. To achieve this, not only does the balanced voltage sharing of two series-connected devices need to be guaranteed, but also the effective short-circuit (SC) protection for series connection needs to be ensured, which is rarely covered in existing literature. Hence, in addition to essential gate driver features such as cross-talk suppression, gate protection, etc., the proposed D-GD incorporates an active voltage balancing circuit to realize balanced voltage sharing. Furthermore, a novel hybrid SC protection design for series connection is seamlessly integrated, achieving faster SC detection and more effective SC protection. The experimental results with a 3.3-kV / 750-A half-bridge SiC mosfet power module are presented, validating its operational performance.</description></item><item><title>A Wide-Input High Step-Up Resonant Converter With High-Ratio Transformer in High-Voltage Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11031226</link><description>This article uses a transformer and a resonant network to present an isolated dc/dc resonant converter with a step-up ratio of tens to hundreds of times.

This article proposes a four-level discontinuous pulsewidth modulation (4L-DPWM) to reduce the switching loss of inverters by clamping the switching state of one phase, and the dc-link capacitor voltage balancing is achieved as well. First, the subsector division is optimized. In each subsector, the switching-state sequence consists of five basic vectors that clamp the phase with the highest current under the unity power factor condition. Then, voltage balancing equations are derived and considered when calculating the dwelling times of five basic vectors. As a result, the switching loss is reduced, and the dc-link capacitor voltage is balanced. Finally, A 6-kVA three-phase four-level inverter prototype is built to conduct experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed 4L-DPWM scheme can effectively balance the capacitor voltage and achieve higher efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Communication-Free Carrier Synchronization High-Frequency Circulating Current Suppression Method Based on Reference Prediction for Parallel Power Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11039098</link><description>Parallel power converter system (PCS) have emerged as a promising solution to reconcile the growing demand for high-power applications with the limited capacity of individual converters. However, in paralleled PCS configurations sharing common dc and ac buses, carrier asynchronization (CA) poses a critical challenge to system performance. CA induces periodic fluctuations in zero sequence circulating current (ZSCC) amplitude proportional to carrier phase deviations, thereby degrading system stability and operational efficiency. To this end, a comprehensive ZSCC analytical model is first established to characterize dynamic interactions among parallel converters, which reveals the detailed relation between CA and ZSCC. Then, a novel reference prediction-based communication-free carrier synchronization method based on reference prediction is developed to suppress ZSCC. It shows strong robustness against grid frequency transients and voltage harmonic distortions. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method is verified by simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning-Based Forward Design Approach for Grid-Connected Inverters With Enhanced Stability and Dynamic Performance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045836</link><description>Grid-connected inverter (GCI) is extensively utilized in renewable energy power systems. However, these systems are prone to cascaded instability when connected to the power grid, even if both the inverter and the grid are stable themselves. To achieve an integrated design that considers cascaded stability and dynamic response, this article proposes a forward design method for GCI based on machine learning, aiming to design the control parameters including phase-locked loop and current loop controllers. First, based on the theoretical model of few samples, the impedance feasible region is rapidly trained by improved K-nearest neighbor and random forest (RF) algorithms, as well as the preliminary feasible samples are obtained. Second, the neighborhood of preliminary feasible samples is searched based on the trained impedance feasible region, thus further obtaining the parameter feasible region. Compared with the theoretical model-driven method, the proposed method achieves rapid design by few samples, which has low complexity and fast computation speed. Finally, the experimental verifications are carried out on a 5 kW inverter prototype, validating the effectiveness of the proposed design method.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Control of a Three-Phase Five-Port Partially Isolated DC&#8211;DC Converter for DC-Powered Commercial Buildings</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045542</link><description>Integrating low-voltage, high-power energy sources and energy storage devices into medium voltage (e.g., $\mathbf {380}\,\text{V}$) dc microgrids presents significant challenges due to the need for high-current and high-gain power conversion. This paper proposes a five-port, partially-isolated dc&#8211;dc converter to efficiently interface solar photovoltaics (PV), battery, fuel cell, and supercapacitor with a $\mathbf {380}\,\text{V}$ dc bus. At the core of the proposed topology is a current-fed asymmetrical three-phase triple active bridge structure, which results in a higher order system, making its modeling and controller design challenging. To address this, a simplified small-signal modeling approach and a proportional&#8211;integral controller-based control scheme are proposed, enabling seamless operation of the converter under any energy management scheme (EMS). Further, a limiter-based novel autonomous power adjustment strategy is introduced to manage substantial load/PV power variations between consecutive EMS updates. The topology reduces power conversion stages, requires $\mathbf {4\%}$ fewer semiconductor switches, uses $\mathbf {20\%}$ fewer magnetic cores per phase and port compered to existing equivalent fully-isolated and partially-isolated converters. It also lowers the load bus voltage undershoot/overshoot by almost 10 times for the same percentage of load change. The experimental validation on a $\mathbf {2}\,\text{kW}$ laboratory-scale prototype confirms the effectiveness of the control strategy and overall system performance.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-High-Gain Interleaved Boost Converter With Low Electric Stress for 800 V Standalone Photovoltaic Charging System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11051008</link><description>This article proposes a novel family of transformerless, ultra-high-gain interleaved boost converters for efficient, reliable, and cost-effective operation in standalone 800 V photovoltaic charging systems.

However, the traditional equalizers exhibit drawbacks such as large size, low efficiency, and a single equalization function. Therefore, an adaptive and efficient equalization topology based on a bidirectional flyback transform is proposed. The single winding flyback converter bidirectional excitation mechanism is introduced, and only one converter is needed for the whole circuit, realizing low cost and high efficiency equalization. Using odd&#8211;even cell grouping control to drive bidirectional excitation, both cell-to-pack and pack-to-cell equalization paths are achieved. Furthermore, three modes, including charging, discharging, and automatic equalization, are supported, making it possible to flexibly choose the suitable equalization approach to achieve fast equalization. Finally, a battery pack experimental platform was built. The results showed that the average equalization efficiency is more than 95%. The voltage difference of the batteries is less than 5 mV after equalization, significantly improving the consistency of the pack.

To enhance the robustness of the controlled system, model-free predictive control is singled out as an alternative solution. However, conventional model-free predictive control method based on ultralocal model still relies on inductance parameters during the design process, and capacitance parameters are also necessary for neutral point voltage balancing. The dependence on parameters leads to a reduction in the robustness of the control method. To address this issue, a novel model-free predictive control approach based on an online neural network approximator is proposed, which combines neural network predictor with adaptive filtering theory. Meanwhile, the neutral point voltage prediction is achieved through the implementation of an adaptive solution. Notably, this method is completely independent of system parameters. Hence, in the face of changes in system operating conditions, the input gain can be adaptively adjusted. Furthermore, the stability of the system is proven. Finally, experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in power converter control.</description></item><item><title>A Mixed Conduction Mode Control Strategy Based on Fixed Turn-off Time for Totem-Pole PFC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029073</link><description>This article proposes a mixed conduction mode (MCM) control strategy based on a fixed turn-off time (FOT) to address the issues of low light-load efficiency, poor power factor, and high current stress in the single-mode operation of the totem-pole power factor correction (PFC) converter. This strategy enables hybrid operation between discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) and continuous conduction mode (CCM) within a half-line cycle. By FOT of the transistor, the switching boundary between DCM and CCM is clearly defined, enabling adaptive mode switching in accordance with output power. Furthermore, a DCM/CCM turn-on time prediction model has been developed to unify the DCM/CCM control loops, thereby ensuring stable MCM operation. Finally, a 1500-W-rated prototype totem-pole PFC converter has been designed to validate the effectiveness of the control strategy. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the ideal critical conduction mode operation, the proposed control strategy effectively reduces the current stress of the converter, and the peak value of the inductance current is reduced by 16.1% at full load. In comparison to the traditional CCM control, the proposed control strategy significantly enhances the light-load performance of the converter, achieving a maximum improvement of 11.6% in light-load efficiency, a 0.295 increase in power factor, and 7.1% decrease in iTHD.</description></item><item><title>Improvement of Electromagnetic-Thermal Characteristics in a Modular In-Wheel Motor Under Open-Circuit Faults and Asymmetric Working Winding Operations Based on Fault-Tolerant Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045224</link><description>Multiunit modular in-wheel motors have a high utilization rate of remaining healthy windings and a high-power density during fault-tolerant (FT) operations. However, when the open-circuit faulty motor operates with FT control, the working windings are asymmetric in the circumferential space, which will cause some problems, such as decreased electromagnetic characteristics and local windings with a higher temperature.

However, it is difficult to operate smoothly at zero and low speed. To address this issue, a novel excitation strategy based on high frequency voltage is proposed for SESM in this paper. First, the topology and excitation principle of SESM are introduced. On this basis, the relationship between the excitation voltage and speed is deduced to reveal the failure mechanism of the traditional excitation strategy. Second, a high frequency voltage with fixed frequency, which is independent of speed, is injected into the armature winding to implement the proposed excitation strategy. Then, the selection principles of its key parameters are discussed. Third, a low-pass filter is designed by hardware in the rotor to improve the output performance of the excitation circuit. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed excitation strategy is verified by experiments at 0 and 45 r/min.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Design of Multichannel High-Frequency Wireless Power Transfer System Based on Load Impedance Compression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11017701</link><description>Miniaturization is one of the main trends in the development of power supplies. High frequency helps to improve the flexibility of the magnetic field space of wireless power transfer technology, making it more suitable for multiload application scenarios. However, it will also increase the sensitivity of the system, causing mutual coupling problems in multiload designs. To this end, this article proposes a load impedance compression mechanism for wired/wireless dual-load applications, adding an impedance conversion network to adjust the branch impedance value. From the perspective of impedance trajectory, the influence of the change in coupling coefficient is compressed, the complex and intertwined trajectory curves between multiple loads are decoupled, and the independence of load power is restored. Meanwhile, based on the traditional secondary side design method, a coil and rectifier impedance trajectory constraint model under variable coupling coefficient is further proposed. Finally, the influence of different power amplifier output filtering conditions on the load branch is analyzed, and the overall design process is given.</description></item><item><title>Extending the Strong-Coupling Region and Enhancing the Power Conversion Capability of the Conventional Three-Coil Pseudo-Hermitian WPT System by Using Double Receivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11023022</link><description>Pseudo-Hermitian wireless power transfer (WPT) system relaxes the rigid symmetry constraints of the parity-time WPT system. However, with series-compensation coils, the conventional three-coil pseudo-Hermitian WPT system has two limitations. One is that it exhibits a limited transfer efficiency under a low load coefficient. The other is if a full-bridge inverter is used to implement the negative resistance, the system&#8217;s output power reaches its minimum at the bifurcation point with a maximum transfer efficiency, significantly restricting the system performance. In this article, a novel double-receiver pseudo-Hermitian WPT system incorporating an intermediate coil is proposed. Compared with the conventional system under the same load, the proposed system has two advantages. One is if the load coefficient is low, using double decoupled RXs can extend the strong-coupling region and enhance the steady transfer efficiency. The other is that a well-designed cross-coupling can be leveraged to enhance the power conversion capability, and circumvent the binary choice between the steady transfer efficiency and the output power. Experimental results demonstrate that by using the proposed system with double decoupled RXs, the strong-coupling region can be extended and the steady transfer efficiency can be enhanced. Experimental results also demonstrate that a few times enhancement in the power conversion capability can be achieved by leveraging the cross-coupling between the double RXs.</description></item><item><title>A Self-Powered Bipolar Rectifierless Series-SSHI Circuit With Dual-Polarity Energy Extraction for Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11027470</link><description>This article presents a self-powered, bipolar, rectifierless series synchronized switch harvesting on inductor (BiReL-SSHI) interface circuit for piezoelectric energy harvesting. At both the positive and negative peaks of the piezoelectric transducer (PZT) voltage, a synchronous switch is automatically activated, enabling energy transfer from the PZT to a storage capacitor, while the inductor simultaneously inverts the PZT voltage for the next half cycle. Compared to conventional full-bridge rectifiers (FBRs) and series synchronized switch harvesting on inductor circuits, the BiReL-SSHI topology employs fewer components by optimizing the positive and negative synchronous switches, thereby reducing power loss and improving energy extraction efficiency. Experimental results show that the BiReL-SSHI achieves a 5.4&#215; improvement in power extraction compared to an FBR, when the open-circuit voltage ($V_{\mathrm{oc}}$) of the PZT is 8 V. Furthermore, in scenarios where a high $V_{\mathrm{oc}}$ is converted to a low output voltage, the BiReL-SSHI achieves superior energy transfer efficiency compared to other interface circuits. Experimental results further demonstrate that at a 3.3 V output under identical vibration conditions, the BiReL-SSHI delivers 5.86&#215; higher output power than the FBR.</description></item><item><title>An Energy Harvesting Interface Based on Reconfigurable Piezoelectric Harvester Array</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11028637</link><description>This article presents a reconfigurable piezoelectric harvester array (RPA) designed for multi-input systems, which dynamically configures its structure based on the intensity of ambient vibrations.

The main contributions include the bilateral reverse integrated magnetic coupler and the quasi-resonant LCC topology parameter optimization. Using the mutual inductance fluctuation ratio as a key indicator, the bilateral reverse coil is integrated and optimized to ensure stable output power during the transmitting coil switching under various lateral misalignments. An equivalent circuit model featuring a variable resistive load is developed to enhance output power capability while maintaining optimal weak inductive zero-voltage switching conditions. The integrated inductor broadens the selection of circuit parameters corresponding to the quasi-resonant range and reduces the parameter sensitivity. The method effectively maintains stable power output during transmitting coil switching under lateral misalignments, addressing cost, heat dissipation, and parameter deviation issues. A 4.5-kW prototype system is presented, and the simulation and experimental results demonstrate that it maintains stable power output within a 10-cm lateral misalignment range. Under y = 0 cm, 5 cm, and 10 cm, the output power fluctuation rates are &#177;4%, &#177;5%, and &#177;6%, respectively. The efficiency is above 91.5% .</description></item><item><title>A Generic Coupled and/or Decoupled Integrated Inductors Optimization for WPT Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11034753</link><description>Using integrated inductors in a wireless power transfer (WPT) system offers various advantages, e.g., reduced ferrite material usage, cost, converter size, and increased power density. This article presents an optimization method for the integrated inductors in WPT systems, which can be applied to not only dc&#8211;dc converters requiring complete decoupling, but also compensation inductors where power is directed to desired coils while decoupled from other coils. A modified lumped loop model is proposed to accelerate the optimization process to enable simultaneous design of multiple decoupled and/or coupled integrated inductors for diverse WPT applications. Using a double-sided LCC configuration as a case study, the optimized design can achieve a 26% and 24% self-inductance reduction for additional integrated inductors on transmitter side and receiver side, respectively. Moreover, it significantly reduces undesired cross-coupling and its fluctuation, while maximizing the desired cross-coupling. In addition, a simple capacitor tuning is introduced to avoid notch phenomena in the inverter. The proposed method is validated in an experimental test setup, achieving a maximum dc&#8211;dc efficiency of 96.5%.</description></item><item><title>Characterization and Modeling of Dual-Single-Layer PCB Resonators for Megahertz Hybrid Inductive and Capacitive Wireless Power Transfer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11037529</link><description>Recent advancements in the dual-single-layer printed-circuit-board (DSL-PCB) resonators open a door to designing megahertz (MHz) wireless power transfer (WPT) systems characterized by high-quality factor, energy efficiency, and suitability for mass production. This article introduces a novel procedure to characterize the DSL-PCB resonator structure and derive the parameters for an equivalent circuit model capable of addressing both capacitive and inductive WPT for a wide-frequency range. The proposed DSL-PCB resonator circuit model is practically evaluated using various dielectric materials in the gap between the two single-layer PCBs. Then, two resonator models are used to form the transmitter and receiver resonators in a hybrid inductive and capacitive WPT system. A new mathematical proof is included to confirm that the coupling coefficient of hybrid WPT is always higher than those of the inductive WPT and capacitive WPT. Theoretical predictions and experimental validations of the system are conducted within the MHz frequency range. The predicted performance characteristics of the WPT system based on DSL-PCB resonators align closely with experimental measurements. The proposed resonator model, along with its corresponding WPT framework, establishes a solid theoretical foundation for future research into MHz WPT systems leveraging DSL-PCB resonators.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Performance Improvement Method for Buck Converters With Small Input Capacitors in WPT Systems Based on Voltage Feedforward Active Damping Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11036694</link><description>In wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, a right-half-plane zero (RHPz) will be indicated in the receiver Buck converter&#8217;s control-to-output transfer function when the receiving end uses a compensating network with current source characteristics. The transient performance of the system is seriously impacted by the presence of the RHPz, particularly when the RHPz is situated near the origin. Recent research has demonstrated that the effects of the RHPz can be mitigated to improve transient output performance by reducing the input capacitance of the Buck converter. However, excessively decreasing the input capacitance may cause the system&#8217;s resonant peak to cross the 0 dB line in the frequency domain, leading to a &#8722;180&#176; phase shift and potential instability. Reducing bandwidth is necessary to keep the system stable, but this approach compromises the Buck converter&#8217;s transient performance. To address the resonant peak issue associated with small input capacitance, this research proposes an active damping control technique, which includes input capacitor voltage feedback and appropriate damping design. This strategy significantly enhances transient performance and increases system bandwidth. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated through simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>A Vertical Overlapping Decoupled Coil for Wireless Power Transfer With High Interoperability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11066263</link><description>Wireless power transfer technology has received extensive attention from scholars around the world in recent years. However, different types of receiving coils are usually only suitable for specific transmitting coils, resulting in poor system interoperability. In order to solve this issue, a novel double-layer coil structure based on vertical overlapping decoupling (VOD) is proposed in this article, By compressing coils of two different magnetic flux paths in the same plane, the structure allows the magnetic fields in the overlap regions to be superimposed on each other, thus enhancing the magnetic flux density of the system. Besides, the vertically intersecting layout at the overlap of the two layers of wires effectively reduces the proximity effect between the coils, increasing the transmission efficiency of the system. Through simulation and experimental research, the VOD coil can achieve high interoperability with DD, square and circular coils, and the transmission efficiency remains above 91.6% at a certain distance.</description></item><item><title>Open Circuit Fault Identification Technique for Switch and Diode in a Reduced Sensor Based Medium Voltage MMC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10922748</link><description>The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is a popular choice for various medium voltage applications. Recently, several works have focussed on reducing the number of sensors and thereby reducing the hardware complexities in an MMC. Although the normal operation of MMC with a reduced sensor scheme showed some decent performance, the detection of a switch or diode fault and its localization with a reduced sensor operation remains challenging. There is very few literature that deal with fault identification in MMC with reduced sensor operation, but they lack either due to complexity in fault identification technique or due to dependency on additional measurement. In this work, for the first time, both switch and diode open circuit faults are identified based on certain measurements such as arm voltages, observed arm current, and switching status. As these measurements are being used for the healthy operation of MMC, additional sensor is avoided for the proposed fault identification technique. The fault identification also avoids a computationally intensive software based approach. Extensive simulation and experimental studies are carried out to identify single and multiple switch and diode faults. It is also verified that there is no false trigger in open circuit submodule fault identification due to step change in output current.</description></item><item><title>Maximizing Output Voltage of Three-Phase Nine-Leg Multilevel STATCOM by Minimum Infinity Norm Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924438</link><description>Power converters based on classic three-phase three-leg voltage source inverters (VSIs) that provide a multilevel output voltage are an interesting alternative to multilevel converters that suffer from complexity and higher costs. However, the multiple degrees of freedom of these systems pose a challenge to their optimal control. In this article, the minimum infinity norm algorithm is proposed and implemented for triple three-leg VSI static synchronous compensators (STATCOM) connected to a three-phase power grid.

In addition, the algorithm has been optimized for real-time systems, resulting in a very fast algorithm with a worst-case complexity of 39 scalar&#8211;scalar multiplications and no division.</description></item><item><title>Harmonic Compensation of a Power-Hardware-in-the-Loop Based Emulator for Induction Machines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10918886</link><description>Power-hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL)-based machine emulator systems use controlled power converters to mimic the behavior of an electric machine. In this article, a PHIL-based machine emulation system is proposed for grid-tied three-phase induction machines (IM). Typically, a switched voltage source inverter (VSI) is employed as an emulator converter in the motor emulation system. However, the VSI introduces various harmonics into the motor emulation system. These harmonics are mainly attributed to dead time, switching components, and control signals. These harmonics deteriorate motor emulation accuracy. Thus, it is important to investigate and compensate for emulator converter harmonics in motor emulation systems. As an important source of these harmonics is dead time, a detailed analysis of the dead time effect on motor emulation will be presented first. Subsequently, a novel artificial neural network (ANN)-based harmonic compensation technique is developed to ensure the mitigation of harmonics in the emulated motor currents. The proposed ANN-based intelligent harmonic compensator leads to the improvement of motor emulation accuracy. Experimental results are obtained from the emulator system and a 5 hp squirrel cage induction motor to validate the proposed emulator with harmonic compensation.</description></item><item><title>A Medium-Voltage 10 MW-Class Modular Magnetic-Coupled Converter (MMCC) With High Power Density for Motor Drive Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908692</link><description>Conventional medium-voltage (MV) 10 MW-class motor drives based on cascaded H-bridge (CHB) and modular multilevel converter (MMC) are plagued by the serious issue of low power density due to the presence of a heavy line-frequency transformer and bulky dc capacitors. To address this problem, this article proposes a 10 MW-class modular magnetic-coupled converter (MMCC). Its basic module is composed by an input full-bridge and one output full-bridge with the dc-links interconnected by a dc-dc stage. Multiple such modules are connected in series and configured into Y-type to construct medium-voltage ac ports on both the grid side and the motor side. Their internal dc-dc stages are jointly linked through LC tanks and a mutual ac bus. By tuning the resonance frequency of LC tanks to the switching frequency, the impedance of the jointly linked dc&#8211;dc stages becomes negligibly small. This configuration not only allows the dc capacitor voltages in the entire system to be automatically balanced without the need for any auxiliary algorithms or additional hardware, but also enables the spontaneous cancellation of low-frequency fluctuating power among the modules that are assembled in three-phase circuit. As a result, the dc capacitance is reduced by 67% compared with that in the CHB and by 97% compared with that in the MMC. Additionally, the weight of the transformer is decreased by 83% in comparison to that of the CHB. These characteristics lead to 3.8-fold and 2.0-fold enhancements in the system power densities relative to the CHB and MMC respectively. The feasibility of the proposal is verified by 10-kV 16-MVA simulations and 380-V 8-kVA experiments.</description></item><item><title>A Reconfigurable Domino IPT System for 35 kV Transmission Line Insulator Ice Melting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916487</link><description>At present, there is no online ice melting method for transmission line insulators whereas the ice on the insulators can cause icing flashovers, being dangerous to power delivery systems. Thus, a reconfigurable domino inductive power transfer (RD-IPT) system is proposed for 35 kV transmission line insulator ice melting. By using thermal relays, the topology of the system can alter automatically corresponding to the temperature of the insulator disks. To avoid the output power decreasing due to the change of the system topology, a frequency control method is also proposed to track the maximum output power under constant load resistances. A prototype is built to validate the performance of the proposed system. Experiment results show that the system can deliver 62.2 W power at least to the insulator heaters, and make the disk temperature 25&#176;C larger than the ambient temperature. Thus, the proposed method can melt ice effectively.</description></item><item><title>Single-Switch Soft-Switched High Step-Up DC&#8211;DC Converter With Reduced Voltage Stress</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10922745</link><description>A soft-switched nonisolated dc&#8211;dc high step-up converter with a single switch is proposed in this article, which can be applied in photovoltaic systems. To achieve high voltage gain and reduce the components voltage stress, coupled inductors and switched capacitor techniques are integrated. A suitable lossless snubber circuit overcoming the lossless snubber challenges such as high component count and freewheeling conduction loss is employed to alleviate the switching losses along with the diodes reverse recovery problems. The lossless snubber circuit adds only two diodes to the proposed structure which is optimum in terms of component count among the soft-switching circuits. Using only one switch with reduced voltage stress and simple passive lossless snubber has contributed to the converter efficiency improvement and reduced control circuit complexity. Furthermore, the input current of the proposed converter is continuous, which facilitates the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) realization and enhances the converter performance. A complete analysis is provided to verify the converter operation, and a 200 W laboratory prototype with an input voltage range of 20 to 30 V and a fixed output voltage of 200 V, is implemented to verify the theoretical analysis.

The originality of the proposed inverter comes from its capacity of providing five operation regimes, offering gains from 4 to 12, and keeping constant the number of levels in the output waveform. It allows to efficiently handle an input voltage variation between 30 and 90 V while producing a stable 220 Vrms output. A novel structure is presented, as well as a new control approach allowing a smooth passage from an operation regime to another one for a continuous variation of the input voltage. It is a common-ground (CG) topology and features a permanent nonzero input current, which are other two constraints imposed in renewable energy. The new inverter presents the lowest cost function among the CG-SCMLIs.

At these frequencies, planar PCB winding transformers are preferred over wire-wound types because of their size and performance advantages. However, high parasitic capacitances, such as inter- and intra-winding capacitance, can increase common-mode (CM) EMI noise and reduce the zero-voltage switching (ZVS) range. To maintain ZVS, either the dead time must be increased or the magnetizing inductance reduced, both of which raise conduction losses. Shielding can mitigate CM noise, but it also adds to transformer&#8217;s parasitic capacitance. This article presents a novel floating shielding technique (FST) that blocks CM noise while improving the ZVS range. Testing on a 242 kHz, 380V/48V, 250W LLC half-bridge converter shows that the FST reduces CM noise by 22 dB&#181;V, preserves ZVS, and increases efficiency by 0.46% compared to conventional shielding.</description></item><item><title>Nonlinear Real-Time Distributed Optimal Control for Frequency Regulation of Cyber&#8211;Physical Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10906534</link><description>With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources in power systems, the distributed optimal control (DOC) method has been regarded as an effective way to integrally solve the load frequency control and economic dispatch problem in real time.

First, based on the integration of the partial primal&#8211;dual gradient algorithm and active disturbance rejection control method, this article develops an active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) based DOC method to improve frequency control performance. Then, the positive projection operators are introduced into the ADRC-based DOC method to realize the generation saturation constraints and thermal limits of tie-lines. The stability is theoretically proved by the Lyapunov function. Furthermore, a delay-compensated extended state observer is designed and used to rederive the DOC method to deal with both physical constraints and time delay. Finally, numeral results are obtained with a real-time hardware-in-loop experiment platform and analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Modulation-Based Semi Dual Active Half Bridge Converter With Coupled Inductor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10910209</link><description>A semi dual active half bridge (DAHB) converter with coupled inductor is proposed for unidirectional low-power applications. This topology comprises three active switches and a diode, reducing the number of required active switches compared with the conventional DAHB converters. Additionally, a coupled inductor is integrated to provide both isolation and energy transfer, eliminating the need for separate input and leakage inductors as well as the transformer. To optimize performance, a hybrid modulation strategy employing a seamless control law by combining pulse width modulation (PWM) and PWM plus phase shift (PPS) modes is also proposed. PWM mode allows the converter to have low current stress, while PPS mode enhances power transfer capability. The proposed control law ensures a seamless transition between the two modes and decouples control variables to simplify implementation. Furthermore, the converter is capable of achieving zero voltage switching on for active switches and zero current switching off for the diode across the full load range and a wide voltage range. Finally, the experimental prototype confirms the validity and effectiveness of the proposed topology and control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Assistive Grid Power Scheme to Enhance Power Balancing Capacity of Solar Photovoltaic CHB Inverter for Grid-Connected Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916494</link><description>Because of their modular design, cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverters are a good fit for grid-connected photovoltaic systems. Power imbalance occurs in the PV system because of partial shading, aging effect, and damage and dusting of panels, and results in overmodulation of the H-bridge modules. Overmodulation of H-bridge modules increases the distortion in grid current and affects the reliability of the system. Majority of the solutions in literature can handle the power imbalance condition when the required modulation index is not more than $\boldsymbol{4/\pi}$. However, during the heavy power imbalance condition, the required modulation is more than $\boldsymbol{4/\pi}$. The popular existing methods to handle heavy power imbalance affect the PV utilization or the system&#8217;s power factor. So, to nullify the heavy power imbalance effectively in the cascaded H-bridge inverter fed single-stage single-phase grid-connected PV system, a assistive grid power scheme is presented in this article. The proposed method enhances the power balancing capacity of the PV system by taking necessary power from the grid and injecting this power into the cascaded H-bridge inverter. A circuit for the proposed method is developed in this article and its operation is elaborated. Furthermore, experimental studies along with simulation results are used in this article to validate the suggested methodology.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability Analysis and Improvement of Multiinverter-Based Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908685</link><description>Although the transient stability of grid has been widely researched, the existing approaches focus more on the transient stability of a single type of grid connected inverter, which are not suitable for the islanded microgrid with multiple types of inverters. Therefore, this article proposes a transient stability analysis and improvement method for a multiinverter-based microgrid (MIMG). First, a large signal synchronization model of MIMG is established, which fully considers the dynamic interactions among various types of inverters, the effects of inverter locations and the time-varying of load power. Then, the concept of the feasible region of current reference of grid-following inverters (GFLs) is proposed. It can ensure that the system has stable equilibrium points (EPs). Second, the attraction domain of EPs (ADEP) is calculated by constructing a new Lyapunov&#8217;s function of MIMG. Based on ADEP, a novel stability index is proposed, which considers inverter&#8217;s dynamics and has clear upper and lower limits to accurately evaluate the system stability. Furthermore, a novel current distribution method of GFLs is proposed, which can maximize the attraction domain&#8217;s radius of EPs and then enhance system transient stability in severe faults. Finally, simulations and experiments are performed to verify the performance of the method.</description></item><item><title>A Family of Bipolar DC&#8211;DC Converters With Interpolar Voltage Self-Balancing Based on FB-BVMs for BLVDC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10918318</link><description>Aiming at the problem of interpolar voltage unbalance in bipolar low voltage dc (BLVDC) microgrid, a family of bipolar dc&#8211;dc converters with interpolar voltage self-balancing is proposed in this article.

The smart transformer (ST) is an effective solution to overcome these challenges by employing accurate control of both active and reactive power flows. Generally, the low-voltage (LV) converter of ST is controlled using a voltage-oriented control strategy, often facing issues with integral saturation and difficult parameter adjustment. Meanwhile, the DG converters operate in the current control mode, which leads to reduced system stability and poor synchronization, particularly during transient events and weak grid scenarios. To overcome these issues, this article proposes a novel Andronov&#8211;Hopf oscillator (AHO) circuit-based virtual oscillator (VO) control for the ST LV converter and DG converters in the ST-based converter-dominated LV distribution systems. This approach allows for simultaneous active and reactive power control of AHO-controlled LV DG converters, with the ST LV converter operating as a slack unit. Additionally, two integral control laws are incorporated to counter the remaining steady-state power errors caused by system uncertainties. The proposed control strategy is simulated in MATLAB/Simulink software and experimentally validated through a power-hardware-in-loop (PHIL) test bench.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Robotic Skill Learning Approach for Assembly Task With Dynamical System and Broad Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916491</link><description>This study introduces a strategy for robotic peg-hole assembly designed to efficiently transfer skills from a human instructor to a robot, achieved through a series of demonstrations and training sessions.

However, due to the poor working environment, the sampling of the speed signal is limited. Therefore, based on the velocity control strategy of the sliding mode observer and the mathematical model of the DWIG, the shortcomings of traditional sliding mode velocity control are analyzed in this article. Based on the principle that the two sets of windings of a double-winding motor are tightly coupled and the flux link is connected, the mechanical parameters of the traditional sliding mode observer are replaced by those on the power winding side that can be observed in real time, thus reducing the inaccurate observation caused by complex conditions and realizing the precise control of the sliding mode without velocity. The compatibility and efficiency of starting control and generation control of DWIG are improved, and the smooth transition and stable generation of the DWIG are ensured.</description></item><item><title>A Flexible Compensation Control Strategy for High-Frequency Link Matrix Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916481</link><description>High-frequency link matrix converters (HFLMCs) omit a dc-link capacitor, which can achieve power transmission from dc to ac with only one power converter stage. However, due to the core shift and vibration, parameter perturbation usually occurs in the isolated high-frequency transformer (IHFT) of the HFLMC, which threatens its safety. This article proposes a flexible compensation control strategy for HFLMC. A rotary IHFT is designed, and the transmission power and current stress on the IHFT of HFLMC under the symmetrical SVM strategy are analyzed.

Capacitors typically operate under dynamic rather than constant stress levels in industrial applications. Quantifying the degradation under dynamic stress is challenging, as it requires consideration of the potential stress interactions. Although such interactions can profoundly affect degradation paths, they are often overlooked, leading to significant deviations between reliability predictions and engineering practices. This article introduces a cumulative degradation model that considers stress interactions to enhance the accuracy of degradation prediction under dynamic stress. This article not only identifies the existence of path dependence in the degradation of electrolytic capacitor parameters but also, building upon this, presents a method for integrating stress interactions with the existing foundation of degradation modeling under constant stress conditions. A path adjustment factor is introduced to enhance prediction accuracy and provide a detailed methodology for the experimental and data analysis required for its estimation. Experimental evidence confirms the practical applicability and accuracy of the method. Compared to conventional models, the proposed method considerably enhances computational accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Low Carbon Economic Energy Management Method in a Microgrid Based on Enhanced D3QN Algorithm With Mixed Penalty Function</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839632</link><description>In this paper, an enhanced dueling double deep Q network algorithm with mixed penalty function (EN-D3QN-MPF) for microgrid energy management control is developed.

Small-signal stability is a representative issue. Though, existing frameworks either ignore the uncertainties of renewables, or only focus on the worst case. In this regard, this paper establishes a small-signal stability constrained stochastic-robust optimal power flow (OPF) model, which aims to optimize the expected cost of scheduling results with respect to the probability distributions of uncertainties while ensuring the small-signal stability requirement even in extreme scenarios. However, the synergy of uncertainties and the complicated small-signal stability mechanism significantly increase the solving difficulty. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework to overcome this challenge. First, we solve the stochastic OPF without small-signal stability constraints. For those results that do not meet the stability requirements, we use them as initial points to locate the effective boundary of the OPF feasible region where the robust small-signal stability requirement is satisfied. The effective boundary location is realized in an iterative manner. Then, in the neighborhood of this effective boundary, we construct a linear surrogate expression to represent the original robust small-signal stability constraint with Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and sample weighted support vector machine (swSVM). Finally, we solve the OPF model with the surrogate constraint. Moreover, we further propose a constraint correction strategy to guarantee the stability requirement. Case studies verify that the proposed method can acquire economical operation schemes and meet the robust small-signal stability requirement at the same time.</description></item><item><title>A Self-Supervised Pre-Learning Method for Low Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839636</link><description>As wind power is becoming a major energy source of power systems, the risk of power shortages due to its intermittent low power output is growing. Accurate forecasting of low wind power is crucial for mitigating these impacts. However, conventional methods struggle with few-sample issues due to the infrequent occurrence of low wind power, limiting accuracy improvements. To address this, a self-supervised pre-learning method is proposed to forecast low wind power occurrence period and output, leveraging the similarities and differences among low output samples to enhance forecasting accuracy. Low wind power output is decomposed into low wind power events (LWPE), which represent the occurrence timeframe, and low wind power processes (LWPP), which represent the power sequences. For LWPE forecasting, a siamese residual shrinkage network based on contrastive learning is introduced. This network pre-learns LWPE features from sample pairs to mitigate the impact of imbalanced sample distribution. For LWPP forecasting, a pattern recognition-based embedded forecasting framework is proposed, embedding typical LWPP fluctuations into the prediction network to improve fit under limited sample conditions. A case study on 3 wind farm clusters shows that this method improves LWPP forecasting accuracy from 84.99%-86.6% to 89.97%, outperforming traditional methods without pre-learning.</description></item><item><title>Estimation of Stability Region for Grid-Forming Inverters Considering Switching Characteristics via Constructing Damping-Reflected Energy Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843855</link><description>Grid-forming (GFM) inverters have been widely used as the interface between renewable energy sources and power grid. During low voltage ride through (LVRT) period, to limit the fault current, GFM inverters will experience the switching of control strategy, which makes the transient stability of GFM inverters exhibit different features from that of synchronous generators (SGs). In this paper, considering the switching characteristics induced by virtual impedance (VI), the framework of predicting the transient stability of GFM inverters during the fault period and after fault clearance is established from the perspective of energy. To reduce the conservativeness of the stability region, a uniform energy function considering the damping dissipation and the dynamics of reactive power control loop is constructed for the transient stability analysis of GFM inverters. Compared with existing approaches, the stability region estimated by the proposed energy function can intuitively show the effect of damping, and effectively reduce the degree of conservatism in transient stability prediction. Finally, simulation and hardware-in-loop experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method in the transient stability prediction of GFM inverters with switching characteristics.</description></item><item><title>A Decentralized Demanded Power Tracking and Voltage Control Method for Wind Farms Based on Data-Driven Sensitivities</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10848501</link><description>Efficient power dispatch in wind farms (WFs) hinges on precise demanded power tracking. This study proposes a decentralized WF power tracking and voltage control method based on data-driven sensitivities (DDSs). This method relies only on local operational variables for model predictive control (MPC), achieving near-global optimal solutions. With a backpropagation algorithm, a new sensitivity calculation method is designed to yield DDSs by computing the gradients of a global mapping model (GMM). The voltage DDSs can be derived simply by calculating the gradient of the voltage GMM and can replace the voltage sensitivities in traditional MPC methods. The power DDSs establishes linear relationships between the power outputs of different wind turbines (WTs), simplifying the WF state-space equations to local prediction models for reducing the quadratic programming dimensions. The three control modes designed based on DDSs enable control without WF line parameters, reduce computational complexity, or combine both effects. The variable spacing constraint linearization method transforms nonlinear constraints into linear ones, addressing the nonlinear coupling between control variables. Testing on a WF with 32 WTs in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method comparable to centralized control methods.</description></item><item><title>Approximately Adaptive Distributionally Robust Optimization for Energy and Reserve Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10849978</link><description>This paper proposes two novel paradigms of approximately adaptive distributionally robust optimization (AADRO) for the energy and reserve dispatch with wind uncertainty. The piecewise linear policy-based AADRO (PLP-AADRO) approximates the adaptive optimization-based recourse decision as piecewise affine adjustment, while the piecewise value function-based AADRO (PVF-AADRO) approximates the quadratic recourse problem as piecewise linear recourse problems. Moreover, an equal probability principle is developed to achieve a high-quality segmentation of the wind power ambiguity set. Consequently, the distributionally robust quadratic cost constraint can be decomposed into decoupled piecewise constraints, allowing the dispatch problem to be formulated as a less-iterative or even non-iterative program. The two-stage AADROs with polyhedron supported uncertainties are first recast precisely as tractable forms with semidefinite constraints, by employing duality theory and S-lemma. Then, the distributionally robust cost constraint in PVF-AADRO is handled by dual vertex generation, and the bilinear terms in both AADROs are addressed by alternating optimization. Numerical simulations verify the efficiency of AADROs in approximating the strict adaptive distributionally robust optimization, and their adaptability in different cases is discussed.</description></item><item><title>Inertia Transmission Control of Full-Power Converter Variable-Speed Pumped Storage System for Grid Frequency Support</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10852016</link><description>Full-power converter variable-speed pumped storage (FPC-VSPS) is a promising technique for flexible power regulation in small-scale distributed hydroelectric power plants. However, conventional vector control limits the synchronous motor of the FPC-VSPS from providing inertia support to the power grid. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces an inertia transmission control for FPC-VSPS based on the concept of DC voltage synchronization. Firstly, the control incorporates the DC capacitor power equation into the GSC control. To enable inertia transmission from the FPC-VSPS synchronous machine, the DC capacitor dynamics are fed into both the speed and torque control of the MSC. Secondly, a torsion spring-rigid body equivalent model is introduced based on the inertia transmission process, analyzing the effects of physical parameters, control coefficients, and transmission delays on the inertia transmission performance. Theoretical analysis and simulation results reveal that the inherent physical differences and transmission delay have a negative impact on the effectiveness of the inertia transmission. Consequently, a DC capacitor design method based on inertia matching is proposed, accounting for the constraints of physical inertia matching, system stability, and operational security. Finally, simulations and experiments prove the necessity of inertia matching and verify the effectiveness of the proposed control to cope with frequency fluctuations in both pumping and generating modes.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Grid-Forming Undersea Pumped Storage to Enable 100% Renewable Offshore Oilfield Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854915</link><description>To advance carbon reduction of the offshore oilfield power system (OOPS), the grid-forming undersea pumped storage system (GFM-UPSS) emerges as a promising solution. This paper introduces a novel framework for a 100% renewable OOPS utilizing the GFM-UPSS. Firstly, the control strategy of the GFM-UPSS is presented. It consists of the grid-side converter (GSC), machine-side converter (MSC), and reversible pump-turbine (RPT) to achieve frequency and voltage regulation. A steady-state model is then developed detailing the water head, power, and volume of the spherical shell. In addition, the paper explores the converter parameter impacts on the GFM-UPSS transient model and derives the closed-form solutions. With the steady-state model, an optimal sizing method is presented and economic advantages in the marine environment are studied for the GFM-UPSS. Finally, EMT simulations are conducted to assess the frequency &amp; voltage stabilities and verify the effectiveness of the GFM-UPSS in enabling a 100% renewable OOPS. The optimal sizing results show that construction costs, mainly for OWP, are dominated and are influenced by sphere radius, placement depth, and start-stop cycles, while a 2.5 capacity ratio between OWP and GFM-UPSS consistently emerges as optimal. Moreover, analysis of transient stability shows that it improves with higher frequency &amp; voltage modulation coefficient and lower virtual impedance. The impact of RPT and MSC, mainly on frequency regulation, is determined by the DC droop coefficient and turbine inertia.</description></item><item><title>A Coordinated Adaptive SMC Method for Frequency Regulation Control in Power Systems With Multiple Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10855531</link><description>The extensive integration of renewable energy resources inevitably gives rise to the complex and uncertain power system, where the somber matter of frequency instability becomes apparent. This article presents a coordinated adaptive radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)-based sliding mode control (CAR-SMC) to reduce the frequency deviation and oscillation of the uncertain power system comprising multiple wind farms. Firstly, the SMC is aimed at establishing the upper layer control law of the frequency regulation controllers. Then, the uncertainties are represented with RBFNN, and an adaptive law is employed to estimate the uncertainties online rapidly and realize the free-chattering of SMC. Furthermore, since a single SMC is only capable of handling a single control input system, a power distribution law based on momentum is proposed to implement the multiple control inputs of the AR-SMC, and also coordinate the frequency regulation abilities of wind turbines and energy storage systems (ESSs). Eventually, the proposed CAR-SMC is validated on a modified IEEE 39-bus system. The simulation results demonstrate that CAR-SMC can enhance the frequency stability in the presence of disturbances and uncertainties during steady-state operation, as well as in under-frequency and over-frequency scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Spatio-Temporal Wind Speed Prediction Based on OWT-STGradRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869841</link><description>Taking into account the orientation and distance characteristics of wind turbine stations in wind farms can improve the accuracy of wind power prediction.

The spatio-temporal data related to wind turbines, such as wind speed, temperature, and air pressure, are integrated into fusion features through spatio-temporal fusion convolutional networks model for pre training to obtain a feature dataset. OWT is used to eliminate the effects of different prevailing winds, and STGrad-RAM is used to characterize the orientation and distance between wind turbine nodes and make the spatial features interpretable. The feature dataset is used for wind speed prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed method has achieved a significant improvement in wind speed prediction accuracy compared to the comparative models.</description></item><item><title>Study on Output Power of Wind Farm Composed of Current-Source Series-Connected Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10870180</link><description>The output power of a wind farm composed of current-source series-connected wind turbine/generators with thyristor rectifier circuits that does not require offshore substation is studied.

The simulation results show that the ratio of the standard deviation of the output fluctuation to the average output of single wind turbine is 39.38%, while that of WF is 6.24%, confirming that output leveling effect is achieved.</description></item><item><title>Learning a Robust Fuzzy Cognitive Map Based on Bubble Entropy Fusion With SCAD Regularization for Solar Power Generation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869385</link><description>Accurate and reliable solar photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting are crucial for cost-effective resource planning and stable operation of smart grids. However, current methods are affected by the intermittent, non-stationary and stochastic nature of solar energy and thus cannot satisfy the requirement of high-precision forecasting. To this end, we propose a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) forecasting method based on bubble entropy and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) regularization, called BesFCM. This method first utilizes bubble entropy to fuse two mode decomposition methods to improve the representation of PV data to capture effective features with significant stability and discriminative ability, then employs a FCM with a combination of fuzzy logic, neural networks, and expert systems to model solar PV power generation, and finally develops a high order FCM learning method based on SCAD regularization to alleviate the overfitting problem, enhancing the robustness and generalization ability of forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate that the BesFCM achieves the best overall performance on PV power datasets from multiple sampling intervals in multiple regions of Belgium compared to multiple state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness for solar power generation forecasting, providing support and reference for improving the quality of smart grid dispatch and reducing spare capacity reserves.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Suppression for Temporary Overvoltage Considering Dynamic Interactions Between LCC-HVDC and Renewable Energy Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874178</link><description>Temporary overvoltage (TOV) severely restricts the development and utilization of renewable power resources (RPRs), especially when RPRs are delivered through the line commutated converter-based high voltage direct current (LCC-HVDC) system. To reveal the TOV mechanism for the sending system during commutation failures (CFs), the transient process of the system is partitioned into different stages, where the evolution of the system trajectories is analyzed. On this basis, the variation of AC voltage and DC current considering complex dynamic interactions between LCC-HVDC and renewable energy Plants (REPs) during repetitive CFs (RCFs) is clearly quantified. After revealing the impact of control parameters of both REPs and the LCC-HVDC on the TOV during RCFs, a collaborative optimization method for control parameters is proposed for TOV suppression. Moreover, when the blocking after the RCF tends to be inevitable, the optimal blocking moment is determined to inhibit the TOV caused by HVDC blocking. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods are verified with EMT simulations of a typical benchmark system.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Modeling and Switching Control of Electric Vehicle Aggregation for Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10878811</link><description>The aggregation and control of massive electric vehicles (EVs) are crucial for grid frequency regulation (FR). However, challenges such as disordered charging, high computational and communication burdens need to be addressed. To this end, a hierarchical hybrid modeling and switching control method for EV aggregation (EVA) is proposed. For modeling, a hybrid state set for EVs comprising three discrete states and one dynamic state is established at the local level. The dynamic state's flexibility allows EVs to charge orderly while considering user demands. At the aggregation level, a Markov-based EVA state space model is designed, integrating the user's willingness-to-pay (WTP) index and hybrid state. It estimates the EVA's FR capacity (FRC) with a lower communication burden and reduces computational burden by simplifying control dimensions. For control, a model predictive control (MPC)-based state switching method is designed at the aggregation level, considering user's FR willingness and power cancellation issue. Furthermore, a predictive compensation mechanism is designed to address model parameter errors resulting from asynchronous control cycles. At the local level, a probabilistic response method is proposed for responding to dispatched control signals, which reduces battery degradation through the state of charge (SOC) based response probability generation. Simulation results validate the method's effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Coordinated Control Strategy for Enhanced Performance of Energy Storage System in Secondary Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879267</link><description>This paper presents a hierarchical coordinated con-trol strategy designed to enhance the overall performance of the energy storage system (ESS) in secondary frequency regulation (SFR). The strategy includes three layers: the system layer, the ESS operation layer, and the coordination control layer. In the system layer, a detailed frequency response model of the multi-area interconnected system is developed. The intrinsic mech-anisms of timing, depth, and the effect of ESS and conventional generating unit (CGU) in SFR are revealed through the sen-sitivity analysis of the power allocation factor. Furthermore, a sensitivity-based adaptive power allocation strategy for ESS and CGU is proposed, which improves the SFR effect while reducing the ESS power and maintaining the state of charge (SOC). In the ESS operation layer, the ESS is divided into two components for integration, employing a monotonic charge-discharge strategy to reduce lifetime degradation caused by frequent charging and discharging, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. In the coordination control layer, considering the power prediction and the ESS operating state, a SOC optimization strategy based on the double-input fuzzy control (DIFC) is proposed. It further dynamically corrects the power allocation factor based on fuzzy rules, optimizing the SOC level to ensure the bidirectional SFR capability of ESS under all conditions. The case studies validate the overall SFR performance of the proposed strategy with different scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Spatiotemporal Graph Contrastive Learning for Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879260</link><description>Accurate and robust wind power forecasting plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and stability of the power system. Hybrid spatiotemporal forecasting models based on graph convolutional networks have received widespread attention due to their advantages in spatial feature extraction. However, these methods are susceptible to the quality of the generated graph due to data noise and missing issues, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning model based on spatiotemporal graph contrastive learning to address the above issues. Specifically, the model's encoder combines an adaptive graph convolutional network with LSTM to capture fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies. To enhance the robustness of the encoder against data noise, we apply feature-level and topology-level data augmentation techniques to the model's input and design two contrastive learning auxiliary tasks from the temporal and spatial dimensions, respectively. Furthermore, to capture more comprehensive spatial correlations, we construct an adaptive graph by fusing the static graph with a learnable parameter matrix. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>A Carryover Storage Valuation Framework for Medium-Term Cascaded Hydropower Planning: A Portland General Electric System Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884034</link><description>Medium-term planning of cascaded hydropower (CHP) determines appropriate carryover storage levels in reservoirs to optimize the usage of available water resources. This optimization seeks to maximize the hydropower generated in the current period (i.e., immediate benefit) plus the potential hydropower generation in the future period (i.e., future value). Thus, in the medium-term planning, properly quantifying the future value deposited in carryover storage is essential to achieve a balanced trade-off between immediate benefit and future value. To this end, this paper presents a framework to quantify the future value of carryover storage, which consists of three major steps: i) constructing a deterministic model to calculate the maximum possible hydropower generation that a given level of carryover storage can deliver in the future period; ii) extracting the implicit locational marginal water value (LMWV) of carryover storage for each reservoir by applying a partition-then-extract algorithm to the constructed model; and iii) developing a set of analytical rules based on the extracted LMWV to effectively calculate the future value. These rules can be seamlessly integrated into medium-term CHP planning models as tractable mixed-integer linear constraints to quantify the future value properly, and can be easily visualized to offer valuable insights for CHP operators. Finally, numerical results on Portland General Electric's CHP demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented framework in aiding medium-term CHP planning to identify suitable carryover storage strategies.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Hydrogen Production Dispatch of Networked Hydrogen-Based Microgrids via a Distributed Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884064</link><description>Hydrogen has drawn significant attention due to its long-term storage capability and wide industrial applications. How to efficiently utilize renewable energy to maximize hydrogen production of a group of spatially distributed electrolyzers is a fundamental problem urgently needed to be solved. This paper is the first to attempt to address the problem by proposing a hydrogen production dispatch (HPD) model for hydrogen-based microgrids with proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. Considering the limited communication and privacy requirement of distributed energy systems, a distributed hydrogen production dispatch framework is constructed. The original nonconvex optimization problem is transformed into a convex form. Furthermore, it is proven that the marginal hydrogen production benefit of each electrolyzer should be equal for the optimal hydrogen production dispatch via Lagrangian duality. By setting the marginal hydrogen production benefit as a consensus variable, a novel distributed consensus-based dispatch algorithm is developed, in which an event-triggered communication scheme is introduced to alleviate the communication burden. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm achieves linear convergence. Results of the case study indicate that the proposed strategy yields the optimal hydrogen production benefit, which is increased by 9.43% compared to on-site hydrogen production and demonstrates excellent solving efficiency especially for large-scale systems.</description></item><item><title>Transient Frequency-Voltage Support Strategy for VSC-MTDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farms Based on Perturbation Observer and Funnel Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884062</link><description>To address the transient frequency and voltage stability challenges posed by low-inertia offshore wind farms (OWFs) connected through voltage source converter (VSC) based multi-terminal high voltage direct current (VSC-MTDC) system, a nonlinear perturbation observer and funnel control-based transient frequency and voltage support (PFTFVS) control strategy is proposed for VSC-MTDC integrated OWFs system.

Typically, the power production from WECs is characterised by pronounced fluctuations at low frequency and high peaks compared to the average. Wave energy test rigs should be able to reproduce these variations to impose realistic conditions to the device under test. Thus, the grid connection of the rig must be sized to cope with high peaks, and additional measures may be required to avoid disturbances on nearby loads and negative effects on voltage quality. The integration of electrical energy storage can smoothen power fluctuations and mitigate these drawbacks, while resulting in lower installation and operating costs. The design methodology indicates how to effectively size the storage unit and which technology to favour based on the type and duration of test campaigns. Numerical simulation results are presented for a dual HIL test rig and operational profiles of three different WEC technologies. For designs with energy storage lifetime shorter than the calendar life, sensitivity analyses indicate that the rig's annual utilisation rate and the level of accelerated testing have a significant effect on the storage energy requirements.</description></item><item><title>Station-Network Cooperative Optimization Planning of Urban Integrated Energy System Considering Heat Storage Capacity of Heat Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891182</link><description>Heat storage capacity of heat network in urban integrated energy system (UIES) has the potential to significantly improve the operational flexibility of the system. To obtain the optimal UIES planning scheme, a UIES station-network cooperative optimization planning (UIES-SNCOP) method considering heat storage capacity is proposed. First, a heat network operation model under constant flow-variable temperature considering flow direction depiction is established for solving the problem that the existing model cannot be directly applied to UIES-SNCOP because the flow direction of pipeline cannot be predetermined. Then, a radial structure-oriented topology model of distribution and heat networks is developed to ensure the radiality of energy supply network while also reducing planning cost.

The planning of UIES is conducted on an urban topology containing 55 nodes to test the performance of the proposed method, and simulation results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other existing methods in terms of reducing planning cost, ensuring radial structure of the energy supply network, utilizing heat storage capacity and enhancing solution accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Adaptive Robust Model for AC Network-Constrained Unit Commitment in Power Systems With Uncertain Wind Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891662</link><description>With wind power being extensively integrated into power systems, its inherent uncertainty and variability pose significant challenges to the power system operational security. Traditional robust optimization methods capture the worst-case scenario, which results in overly conservative decisions, with insufficient considerations on AC network constraints in power systems. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel adaptive robust AC network-constrained unit commitment (AC-NCUC) model that considers both the AC network security and the uncertainty of wind power output in power systems. More specifically, a convex polyhedral uncertainty set is constructed to characterize the uncertain wind power output. Here, the conservativeness of UC dispatch decisions can be adjusted by modifying the size of the convex polyhedral uncertainty set. Then, we combine Benders&#8217; decomposition and Newton-Raphson methods to solve the AC-NCUC model for the optimal dispatch decisions. Simulation results on the modified IEEE 6-bus and IEEE RTS 79 systems validate the rationality and validity of our proposed approach. The proposed AC-NCUC model effectively maintains the system security while ensuring economic effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Power Control in Wind Farms for Gearbox Load Reduction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891746</link><description>Rapid power and torque fluctuations in time-varying conditions increase the fatigue load and failure rate of wind turbine (WT) gearboxes. In this study, an optimal power control method is proposed for a wind farm (WF) to improve the power flow and service quality, allowing the WF to track the power demand instructions from the transmission system operator while minimizing the fluctuations of vibration displacements inside the gearbox. A comprehensive dynamic model of the gearbox is developed by analyzing the transmission mechanism of key gearbox components, such as the planet carrier, planet gears, sun gears, and spur gears, describing the correlation between the internal vibration and mechanical torque and power output. Then, an optimal power control problem is formulated based on model predictive control to suppress the fatigue load while tracking power. Furthermore, a fatigue evaluation system is built based on the real-time vibration state inside the gearbox to characterize the service quality of WTs and guide the power generation of the WF. This approach provides a safety-oriented boundary regarding the WT fatigue load in the optimal power dispatch issue of WFs to suppress potential WT failures.

This study proposes an enhanced multi quantile regression-based loss function specially tailored to train models to generate both deterministic forecast and the corresponding prediction intervals. Though the regression architecture of the model plays an important role in extracting precise forecasts, however, its efficiency is often ignored which may be a downside for short term forecasting scenarios where model training time may also be a significant factor. The present study therefore designed a multi-scale dilated convolution-based architecture for enhanced efficiency. The architecture generates predictions at different scales which are combined using particle swarm optimization to obtain optimal forecasts. The model is trained using the proposed loss function on datasets from both NREL simulations and operational Chinese state grid measurements across three different locations. The proposed model exhibits excellent forecasting performance in comparative experiments with both simulated and real-world operational datasets.</description></item><item><title>Stability Region Estimation and Decentralized Transient Control for Parallel Grid-Tied Grid-Forming Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892023</link><description>Renewable energyes are highly penetrated in power system through Grid-forming inverter (GFMI). Transient stability of single GFMI system under severe grid fault has been thoroughly analyzed in recent years, but quantitative analysis for parallel grid-tied GFMI system is rarely studied. To fill this gap, the large signal equivalent model of parallel system considering the interaction between inverters is newly built. Based on the model, the Lyapunov function incorporating kinetic energy, potential energy, damping dissipation, and interaction energy is constructed for accurate stability region estimation. Then, the effect of control parameters on stability region is analyzed, indicating that increasing damping, reducing inertia, and lowering reference power of one GFMI can deteriorate stability margin of parallel GFMI system due to the enlarged interaction power, which is distinct from single GFMI system. For this, a decentralized transient control that adaptively adjusts damping, inertia, and reference power is proposed to guarantee transient stability and achieve low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) for parallel system without relying on communication, system information. Finally, simulation and experimental tests validate the correctness of theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of proposed control.</description></item><item><title>Aggregation Feasible Region of Full Power Spectrum Electric Vehicles Based on Polyhedron Projection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10900425</link><description>The aggregation of electric vehicles (EVs) can take full advantage of the power flexibility of EV clusters, based on the aggregation feasible region (AFR) of EVs. However, existing aggregation techniques of conventional distributed energy resources (DERs), exhibit significant inaccuracies or require excessive computational efforts when applied to EVs with high power and small capacity. To solve this problem, an iterative method based on the high dimensional polyhedron projection principle is proposed to derive the exact AFR formula for the full power spectrum of EVs, and the limitations of the existing analytical AFR are revealed. The results reveal that the exact AFR is a set of linear inequalities, whose coefficients can be represented in binary code, and the complexity of the right side is linear with the number of EVs, making it highly conducive to programming calculations. Moreover, this paper proposes a simplified practical AFR based on the exact AFR, which reduces computational complexity. Numerical simulation cases demonstrate that the accuracy of this simplified approach is still higher than that of existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Matrix Adaptive Correction-Based Dynamic Dimensionality Reduction Method for Voltage-Related TSCOPF in Bulk Power Systems With High Wind Power Penetration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902439</link><description>Transient security-constrained optimal power flow (TSCOPF) is an important class of problems for system operation. Several challenges arise when dealing with bulk power grids, including the large size and complex transient voltage behaviors. This paper aims to address such hurdles by proposing a dynamic dimensionality reduction matrix adaptive correction (DDR-MAC) algorithm, which can effectively evaluate proper Volt/Var levels to guarantee secure system operation. First, this paper performs dimensionality reduction processing at the bus and device levels to obtain a low-dimensional model with dominant modes, which solves the problems of high-order and large computational volumes of differential equations. Moreover, a dimensionality reduction error assessment model is established to ensure reduced-order accuracy. Then, the reduced-order TSCOPF model is equivalently decomposed into a mixed-integer linear optimization model and a combined coefficient correction model for system dynamic constraints and steady-state nonlinear constraints. Furthermore, a secant/tangent sensitivity adaptive correction method is presented to achieve fast computation. The DDR-MAC approach is verified across differently scaled IEEE test systems and the Nordic test system and can improve computational efficiency by 49.07% while offering higher accuracy than traditional computation methods.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Synthetic Inertia Control for Two-Area Power Systems With Wind Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10906542</link><description>Modern power systems may experience decrease in stability due to the increased integration of variable generation sources that depend on power electronics converters. A common control strategy is to incorporate synthetic inertia from wind turbines, typically using state-feedback control in a single-area power system model that assumes uniform frequency. As power systems become more interconnected, different frequency behaviors can emerge in multiple areas, casting doubt on current methods that do not consider multi-area stability. Furthermore, most single-area synthetic inertia methods ignore the limitations of communication systems in real power systems. This paper proposes a decentralized synthetic inertia control strategy for a two-area power system with wind power. This approach accounts for the actual behavior of power systems in different areas and the limitations of communication systems in real scenarios. Numerical results, derived from dynamic models using actual operating data from the Chilean Power System, demonstrate that the decentralized control performs comparably to centralized control in maintaining power system stability and optimizing frequency nadir. However, the decentralized control has the advantage of relying solely on local variables, eliminating the need for communication links between areas during operation.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Strategy for Frequency Regulating and MPPT for Photovoltaic Sources Based on a Novel Three-Parameter Characteristic Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10907967</link><description>The large-scale integration of Photovoltaic (PV) sources may reduce system inertia and power quality, resulting in increased frequency fluctuations and diminished system stability due to lack of the primary frequency regulation (FR) capability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified strategy for frequency regulating and Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) for PV sources to provide ancillary services to the power grid. The strategy employs a specifically designed active power control (APC) method to enable rapid and flexible power adjustments of PV sources, with which further FR function may be achieved. The presented APC algorithm adopts an iterative technique with a novel three-parameter PV characteristic curve, making it possible to reconstruct the real-time PV generation model, clarify the relationship between the system frequency, output power, and operating voltage. Its high control accuracy, fast convergence rate, and strong explainability offer significant practical value. Additionally, this adaptive control strategy features autonomous switch between the FR and MPPT modes adapting to real-time irradiation changes, without the need for additional irradiation or temperature sensors. The integration enhances both solar utilization efficiency and the FR capability, while eliminating the controller transitions during operating mode switches. Hardware-in-the-loop tests validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Online Monitoring of Battery Degradation for Enhanced Power Smoothing of PV Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908680</link><description>In pursuit of a carbon-neutral future, the integration of photovoltaic (PV) power plants into the electrical power grid is expanding. Although beneficial, this expansion presents challenges due to weather-induced variability, which destabilizes the grid and causes voltage and frequency deviations. A viable solution is the use of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) alongside PV power plants. However, conventional controllers, which lead to uniform and frequent charging cycles, accelerate degradation and reduce efficiency in BESS. To address this, this paper proposes segmenting the BESS units into distinct charging and discharging groups, effectively minimizing battery cycling and enhancing their lifespan. The controller dynamically assigns batteries to each group based on power fluctuation forecasts using a power-sharing model. This model manages battery activation, enables inter-group support, and balances degradation by monitoring BESS charge levels and assessing battery health through an online system. This controller, coupled with a degradation balancing layer, strategically prioritizes units based on their cycling age. The proposed technique was rigorously tested and experimentally validated, demonstrating that it significantly reduces battery degradation to a maximum of 0.099%, in stark contrast to the up to 4.41% observed with conventional controllers.</description></item><item><title>State Transfer Induced Transient Synchronization Instability of GFM-VSC: Analysis and Improvement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909647</link><description>The operation mode of grid-forming voltage source converters (GFM-VSCs) may switch between voltage source mode (VSM) and current source mode (CSM) under some situations such as grid faults, owing to the current limitation control. During the mode-switching process, there is state transfer from the final state of the last mode to the initial state of the next mode, which impacts the transient synchronization stability (TSS) of GFM-VSCs. This paper primarily focuses on analyzing and improving the TSS of GFM-VSCs by considering the effect of state transfer. A novel transient instability mechanism is revealed through the existence analysis of equilibrium points. It clarifies that the state transfer may cause the operating trajectory during faults to bypass the stable equilibrium point in CSM before diverging to the next cycle, thereby resulting in transient synchronization instability. Besides, to further analyze the TSS of mode-switched VSCs considering the dynamics during faults, multiple Lyapunov functions are adopted to derive the TSS criteria and boundaries. It has been identified that lowering the minimum critical current and adjusting the saturated current phase in accordance with virtual power angle (VPA) dynamics can enhance the TSS. Therefore, a VPA feedback-based current limiting strategy is proposed to safeguard GFM-VSCs against overcurrent and ensure the TSS. The validity of the new transient instability mechanism and the efficacy of the proposed strategy are confirmed through simulations of a GFM-VSC connected to an IEEE 39-bus power grid and hardware-in-the-loop experiments.</description></item><item><title>Assessing Dynamic Reserves vs. Stochastic Optimization for Effective Integration of Operating Probabilistic Forecasts</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909649</link><description>Probabilistic forecasting is becoming pivotal in utilities' decision-making processes, offering an accurate portrayal of plausible forecast deviations as opposed to deterministic forecasting which only focuses on the expected forecasted variables. Two methods, dynamic reserve and stochastic optimization, have been used to integrate probabilistic forecasts into power system operational planning. Dynamic reserve predicts system reserve requirements based on observed (from historical observations) or expected (from probabilistic forecasts) uncertainty spreads. This approach has a low computational burden, but it is commitment and dispatch agnostic. Stochastic optimization, on the other hand, considers multiple scenarios simultaneously (from probabilistic forecasts), allocating recourse across the commitment and dispatch variables, but demanding high computational resources and time. The selection between these methods depends on utility requirements and specific situations. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of both methods using a calibrated real-size system representing the Southern Company for medium and high solar penetration levels. Additionally, it proposes a hybrid dynamic reserve and stochastic optimization approach with a risk evaluation pre-scheduling procedure to enhance decision-making.</description></item><item><title>Minimax Regret Robust Co-Planning of Transmission and Energy Storage Systems With Mixed Integer Recourse</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909558</link><description>The growing penetration of renewable energy sources, with intermittent and uncertain nature, brings new challenges to the secure and efficient operation of power systems. Expanding transmission networks and utilizing energy storage (ES) have been introduced as effective solutions to address these challenges. This paper presents a minimax regret robust co-planning model with mixed integer recourse for transmission and ES systems, designed from the perspective of a central planner. The model considers a polyhedral uncertainty set for future peak load growth, while uncertainties in wind farm expansion are addressed through internal scenario analysis. This approach will guarantee the robustness of investment decisions and provide the central planner with a clear picture of the maximum regret among all possible scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed minimax regret framework facilitates strategic planning for ES installation after the resolution of long-term uncertainties. In this paper, we reformulate the model into a standard min-max-min problem, in which the maximization level is only over uncertainties. Subsequently, a five-level solution strategy based on a modified nested column and constraint generation decomposition technique is represented to deal with the intractability and complexity of the problem caused by binary variables of transmission lines and ES blocks. The model is finally evaluated through comprehensive simulation studies to verify its tractability, practicality, and effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic Model-Based Minute-Level Optimal Operation Strategy for Alkaline Electrolyzers in Wind-Hydrogen Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912757</link><description>Maintaining the export power of wind-hydrogen systems within a stable range is critical for power system security. However, this is challenged by the mismatch between large time-scale of alkaline electrolyzer (AWE) scheduling strategies and the short-term fluctuations of wind power. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel minute-level optimization strategy for AWE operation. Developing effective small time-scale strategies requires a detailed consideration of AWE dynamics. To this end, we first introduce its steady-state electrochemical characteristics and third-order dynamic models for both temperature and Hydrogen-to-Oxygen (HTO) ratio. Based on these refined models, we develop an AWE optimization framework that enables electrolysis power to track minute-level wind power fluctuations by dynamically adjusting fine-grained variables, such as the lye flow rate, cooling flow rate, and pressure, at 1-minute intervals. To overcome the computational challenges posed by the detailed modeling, we propose an improved model predictive control (MPC) framework. This framework incorporates model simplifications to improve computational efficiency, along with an optimization-simulation iterative procedure to ensure operational feasibility. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed strategy extends the AWE load range by 13.8% and reduces wind power curtailment by 15.06%. Additionally, synergies among control variables enable the system to achieve a balance between operational efficiency, stability, and security, highlighting the potential of this approach to enhance the performance of wind-hydrogen integrated systems.</description></item><item><title>Promote Data Sharing in Integrated Power-Traffic Networks: A Coalition Game Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10910214</link><description>Accurately estimating spatial-temporal electric vehicles' (EVs) charging demands is crucial for the secure and economic operation of power systems. At present, the distribution system operator (DSO) relies on historical data collected at each charging station to estimate future EV charging demand. However, the station-level forecast disregards EVs' spatial correlations within traffic networks (TNs) and might suffer significant forecast error, forcing the DSO to make conservative scheduling at the expense of operation economics. To this end, this paper proposes to leverage cross-sector information (i.e., traffic demand data and network parameters in TNs) to enhance forecast accuracy and avoid over-conservative operations. To facilitate the data sharing among the DSO and TN data holders (i.e., traffic authority and navigation App. companies), we adopt the Coalition Game theory to uncover how these entities could cooperate to benefit each other, and to fairly allocate the extra profits (i.e., the operational cost reduction induced by the improved forecasts) among themselves. The conditional value-at-risk theory is adopted to model the risk-averse behavior of the DSO. In case studies, we reveal the non-negligible impact of TN condition variations on EV charging distributions. Moreover, numerical results show that sharing high-quality traffic data contributes to the reduction in DSO's operating cost by utmost 20.8% as compared to the current practice without data sharing.</description></item><item><title>An Optimization Framework for Component Sizing and Energy Management in Electric-Hydrogen Hybrid Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10915713</link><description>This paper proposes an optimization framework to address the component sizing and energy management problems in an electric-hydrogen hybrid energy storage system connected to a wind turbine. The total cost of the hybrid system is minimized using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In particular, four decision variables are optimized: the electrolyzer (EL) size, the supercapacitor (SC) size, and two parameters in the energy management strategy (EMS). To determine the power split factor for the wind power, the EMS introduces an artificial potential field (APF) and defines a virtual force based on the SC state of charge (SOC). Two APF parameters are optimized to tune the power allocation between the EL and the SC: the shaping parameter of the virtual force and the basis parameter of the power split factor. Since the cutoff frequency of the low pass filter (LPF) in the EMS is adaptively updated based on the optimized APF parameters, the proposed framework is referred to as the &#8220;OP-APF&#8221; framework. The effectiveness of the OP-APF framework is validated by performing MATLAB and real-time simulations. Compared to three baseline frameworks, OP-APF is more effective in reducing the system total cost, controlling the SC SOC, and alleviating the EL degradation.</description></item><item><title>Photovoltaic Power Prediction Considering Multifactorial Dynamic Effects: A Dynamic Locally Featured Embedding-Based Broad Learning System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916943</link><description>Accurate photovoltaic power (PVP) prediction is a prerequisite for the efficient and stable operation of new power systems. While existing research has extensively explored the relationship between global factors such as temperature, irradiance, and photovoltaic power, the local dynamic impacts of these factors are often overlooked, which may reduce the accuracy of predictions. To address this issue, this paper considers the dynamic interrelationships among multiple factors and proposes a dynamic locally featured embedding-based broad learning system (DLFE-BLS) algorithm for PVP prediction. Firstly, a novel dynamic phase space reconstruction method (DPSR) is proposed to characterize the dynamic properties of multivariate data. Furthermore, a dynamic local featured embedding (DLFE) algorithm is introduced to extract local dynamic features from multivariate data. Finally, by integrating the dynamic reconstruction and dynamic feature extraction processes into the broad learning system (BLS) framework, we propose the DLFE-BLS algorithm to improve the accuracy of PVP prediction. Case studies have shown that DLFE-BLS outperforms other models in terms of prediction accuracy. Additionally, it has the highest accuracy when applied to transfer prediction.</description></item><item><title>Optimal VSG BESS Sizing for Improving Grid-Following Converter Stability Under Various Dispatch Scenarios and Grid Strengths</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924310</link><description>As renewable energy integration increases, ensuring stability of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) in weak grids is crucial, as grid-following (GFL) converters often become unstable under such conditions. Integrating virtual synchronous generator (VSG) batteries has shown potential to improve GFL stability, but determining the optimal size of the VSG required for stability remains an open question. Existing research typically relies on small-signal or impedance models for stability analysis, which are only valid at a single operating point and do not consider the full range of operating conditions, including various dispatch scenarios and grid strengths. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel methodology to visualize the system's stable operating region, offering insights into stability boundaries across various real power and grid impedance variations. Additionally, it introduces an optimal VSG battery sizing strategy that accounts for these variations, ensuring stability while minimizing VSG capacity. The strategy's effectiveness is validated through comprehensive PSCAD simulations, demonstrating its reliability across a wide range of real power and grid impedance operating points.</description></item><item><title>Fast Centralized Model Predictive Control for Wave Energy Converter Arrays Based on Rollout</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10923686</link><description>Centralized control of wave energy converter (WEC) arrays for grid-scale generation can achieve higher energy production than decentralized (independent) control, due to its capability of fully exploiting mutual radiation effects. However, the state-of-the-art centralized model predictive control (CMPC) is significantly more computationally challenging than decentralized MPC (DMPC), since the number of control moves to be optimized grows in proportion to the number of WECs. In this paper, a fast CMPC controller is proposed, whose idea is to optimize only the first few control moves while rolling out future system trajectories using a fixed controller. A linear, two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) controller with a sea-state-dependent control coefficient tuning strategy is further proposed to serve as the rollout controller. It is shown that the proposed rollout-based CMPC (R-CMPC) can maintain almost the same energy production as conventional CMPC under a wide range of sea states, while significantly reducing the optimization dimension (in the studied case, by a factor of 6), enabling ultra-fast online computation (about 40 times faster than conventional CMPC).</description></item><item><title>Energy Management of Multi-Energy Communities: A Hierarchical MIQP-Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10923740</link><description>This paper proposes a hybrid mixed-integer quadratic programming-constrained deep reinforcement learning (MIQP-CDRL) framework for energy management of multi-energy communities. The framework employs a hierarchical two-layer structure: the MIQP layer handles day-ahead scheduling, minimizing operational costs while ensuring system constraint satisfaction, while the CDRL agent makes real-time adjustments. The goal of this framework is to combine the strengths of CDRL in addressing sequential decision-making problems in stochastic systems with the advantages of a mathematical programming model to guide the agent's exploration during the training and reduce the dependency on opaque policies during real-time operation. The system dynamics are modeled as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), which is solved by a model-free CDRL agent built upon the constrained policy optimization (CPO) algorithm. Practical test results demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in improving the optimality and feasibility of the real-time solutions compared to existing stand-alone DRL approaches.</description></item><item><title>Complex Variable Design for Power Control of Grid-Forming Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854804</link><description>The analysis and design of the grid-forming (GFM) power loop and decoupling control can be challenging due to the coupled high-order system, where active and reactive power controls are typically designed separately using a dual-input-dual-output model.

To solve this issue, this paper has proposed an uninterruptable hierarchical distributed coordinated control scheme of islanded hybrid AC/DC microgrid clusters. Firstly, when grid-forming converter faults occur in a certain AC microgrid (ACMG), the interlinking converter connected with the faulty subgrid switches its control mode into grid-forming, providing stable voltage and frequency support for the faulty ACMG. Then, a two-layer coordinated control scheme is presented, where the first layer is designed for the remaining interlinking converters, and the second layer is designed for converters in normal subgrids and grid-following converters in abnormal ACMG together with its interlinking converter. By the control mode switch of the IC and the two-layer coordinated control scheme, accurate power sharing can quickly fill the power deficit in the faulty subgrid, and the voltage and frequency of the microgrid clusters can remain stable. Verification results indicate that with the proposed scheme, the islanded AC/DC microgrid clusters can operate uninterruptedly under different kinds of grid-forming converter faults.</description></item><item><title>Robust Consensus-Based Secondary Control for Microgrids Considering Communication Delay and Noises: A Kalman Filter-Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994544</link><description>To achieve the frequency and voltage regulation as well as active and reactive power sharing, the consensus-based secondary controls of microgrids rely on communication network to exchange signals between neighbor inverters, which may be affected by the communication delay and noises. Unlike the existing methods that focus solely on communication delay, this paper proposes a Kalman filter-based robust consensus control to address the communication delay and noises comprehensively. Based on the discrete differential equation of the signal transmitted via communication network, the multi-step prediction model of the delayed signal is firstly built by considering the prediction errors. The state space model is then constructed by taking the predicted signals at each step as the state variables while the delayed and noise-involved signal and its differential value are seen as the measurements. A Kalman filter is further designed to comprehensively handle the communication delay, noises and prediction errors to estimate the true signal generated from neighbor inverters. With the estimated signals of all neighbor inverters, the consensus control is performed to coordinate the grid-following and grid-forming inverters within the microgrid. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with simulations and experiments performed on the modified IEEE-33 bus-based microgrid.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Directional Protection Element for Converter-Based Islanded Hybrid Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11006132</link><description>This paper proposes a unified directional element (UDE) for protecting converter-dominated islanded hybrid microgrids (IHMGs) relying on phase current samples. For the AC sub-network, the fault diagnosis component (FDC) is constructed by averaging the first-order derivative (FOD) of the phase currents at each line end over one power cycle. On the DC side, the FDC is obtained directly by computing the FOD of the pole current. The current direction of each phase/pole can be identified based on the first peak sign of the FDC. Once a disturbance occurs, the UDE is activated utilizing a startup unit, and the first peak sign of the FDC of each phase/pole is shared between both terminals of the line to differentiate internal faults from other disturbances or external faults. A phase/pole is being faulted if both values of the FDC at both sides of the line have the same sign. The developed UDE is verified by simulating the modified IEEE 33-bus IHMG on PSCAD/EMTDC. Several scenarios are carried out including load switching as well as external and internal faults. Additionally, the effect of different factors is examined, encompassing measurement inaccuracies and high resistance faults.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Power Flow Estimation for MVDC Distribution Systems Based on Physics-Embedded FCN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945791</link><description>Maintaining high prediction accuracy with varying grid topologies poses a significant challenge to adopting neural network (NN)-based approaches for power flow (PF) estimation in medium-voltage direct current (MVDC) distribution systems. This paper proposes a physics-embedded fully convolutional network (PEFCN) to improve the accuracy. Physics-embedded techniques are incorporated in the proposed PEFCN through 1) architecture reconstruction, and 2) loss function reformulation. Architecture is reconstructed by input channel conversion calculation in a new physics operation layer. This process offers physical connections among the three input matrix channels (voltage, current, and line conductance). Three new physics loss terms are included in the loss function to restrict the outliers violating the limits of converter power ratings and terminal MVDC voltages. The two operations enable the FCN to achieve improved prediction accuracy and strong generalization capabilities. Five MVDC distribution systems, characterized by different dc voltage levels and topology configurations, serve to validate the superiority of the proposed PEFCN over other NNs in the PF estimation for scenarios involving both fixed and varying system structures. Moreover, a modified IEEE 69-bus distribution system is further used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed PEFCN for larger systems.</description></item><item><title>Non-Iterative Sensitivity-Based Switch Exchange Method for Distribution Network Reconfiguration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10960360</link><description>In this paper, a non-iterative sensitivity-based zsolve the distribution network reconfiguration (DNR) problem and ensure the security of the switch operation process, while maintaining the node voltage within the feasible range. The NSSE method involved the sensitivity-based network reconfiguration (SNR) stage and sensitivity-based power optimization (SPO) stage. In the SNR stage, the computational speed was improved by considering the dynamic voltage sensitivity with respect to the compensated power analysis, while the network power losses and number of switching times were minimized. The closed-loop and open-loop operation model was developed to solve the compensated power for simulating the switch operation process. Moreover, the maximum loop current was set as a constraint to avoid the equipment risk of switching operation. Each switch operation process can be formulated as integer quadratic programming (IQP) to obtain the optimal network topology and switch operation sequence with the non-iterative calculations. In the SPO stage, the active and reactive power outputs of distributed generations (DGs) were optimized to regulate the node voltage and reduce the active power curtailment. The effectiveness of the proposed NSSE method on the calculation speed and accuracy was validated in MATLAB.</description></item><item><title>Multiagent System-Based VPPs Cooperative Power Control for Frequency Regulation Considering Diverse Communication Issues</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948420</link><description>Virtual power plants (VPPs) possess significant potential to support power systems&#8217; frequency regulation through the aggregation of demand-side distributed energy resources. However, due to their heavy reliance on information technology, VPPs inevitably face diverse communication issues, such as cyber-attacks, privacy disclosure, and packet losses, which poses a serious challenge to ensure efficient power control for frequency regulation. To this end, this paper proposes a multiagent system-based VPPs cooperative power control strategy to achieve frequency regulation in a resilient, optimal, and scalable manner.

Finally, simulation results reveal that, when confronting diverse communication issues, the proposed strategy exhibits significant effects in defending against cyber-attacks, ensuring privacy security, alleviating the communication burden, and achieving fast response, thus effectively facilitating VPPs frequency regulation.</description></item><item><title>Voltage-Source Control for Green-Hydrogen Hybrid Energy Storage System With Operational Constraints and Current Rate Limiter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947357</link><description>Green hydrogen produced from renewable energy generation (RES) is facilitating the energy transition. Due to the complicated operational constraints of green-hydrogen hybrid energy storage system (GH-HESS), the existing two-layer power-based control architecture is prevalent, but it heavily relies on the communication infrastructure and the prediction accuracy of RES&#8217;s power. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel voltage-source hierarchical control framework for the grid-connected GH-HESS to solve the above problems. Considering the electricity price, the hot-standby current and safety of the hydrogen production of the electrolyzer, the current allocation between hydrogen energy storage and power grid is achieved for the continuous stable operation of GH-HESS even in the situation with potential communication failure. When the current rate limiter is adopted for the fuel starvation phenomenon of fuel cell, the current feed-forward loop and current-based secondary control are designed to solve the trade-off problem between the current overshoot and convergence speed of the tradition voltage-source control, where the large current overshoot will cause irreversible damage to hydrogen energy storage. Battery energy storage rapidly responses the power fluctuation from RES, while the steady-state power vacancy is undertaken by hydrogen energy storage. Finally, a 800V DC microgrid based on NI-PXI real-time platform is built to validate its advantages.</description></item><item><title>Reliability and Comfort-Aware Operation Optimization for Hydrogen-Based Building Energy Systems in Off-Grid Mode</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965864</link><description>Hydrogen-based energy systems have gained wide attention due to their significant potential for relieving energy crises and environmental problems. However, existing studies neglect occupant comfort control in hydrogen-based building energy systems (HBESs). In this paper, we investigate a reliability and comfort-aware operation optimization problem of an HBES in off-grid mode. Achieving the above aim encounters several challenges due to multi-source uncertainties, implicit indoor environmental dynamics, temporally and spatially coupled constraints, and nonlinear constraints. To address the above challenges, we propose a physics-embedded neural network (PENN)-assisted hierarchical model predictive control (MPC) algorithm. Specifically, the PENN architecture is adopted to capture the indoor dynamics accurately. Then, the PENN-assisted upper-level MPC implements occupant comfort control and optimizes the multi-energy demands. Next, the lower-level MPC optimizes the system operation cost and reliability with known multi-energy demands decided by the upper-level MPC. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms baselines in terms of operation cost, system reliability, and indoor occupant comfort.</description></item><item><title>Exploring the Feasible Regulation Region of Building HVAC Systems Within Hygro-Thermal Comfort</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11006322</link><description>Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems are widely recognized as promising demand response (DR) resources for enhancing grid flexibility. Despite extensive research on evaluating the regulation capacity of HVAC systems, the role of humidity in air dynamic description and occupant comfort assessment during DR has been overlooked. This paper addresses these gaps by exploring the feasible regulation region of HVAC systems while meeting occupant hygro-thermal comfort. Firstly, a comprehensive model of HVAC systems is developed to describe the hygro-thermal air dynamics and equipment characteristics. Subsequently, the hygro-thermal comfort area is defined to establish permissible temperature and humidity boundaries. Based on key constraints, the hygro-thermal air dynamics are categorized into 3 distinct types. Moreover, a novel criterion is proposed to identify these dynamics without requiring full knowledge of boundary conditions. On this basis, the maximum regulation capacities are quantitatively evaluated to explore the feasible regulation region throughout the day. Finally, numerical case studies are conducted to validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that humidity plays a crucial role in the operating power and the feasible regulation region of HVAC systems. Incorporating humidity improves hygro-thermal comfort, thereby encouraging more occupant participation in DR programs.</description></item><item><title>Automated Fast Frequency Response From Inverter-Based Motor Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002578</link><description>The increasing integration of inverter-based renewable generation presents challenges for the frequency stability of power systems, primarily due to reduced system inertia and governor response&#8212;collectively known as Fast Frequency Response (FFR). Obtaining FFR from inverter-based generation requires reserving operational headroom, resulting in a lost opportunity to generate more renewable energy. Recently, inverter-based loads have been proposed as potential sources of FFR; however, critical gaps remain in the control algorithms needed to transform these loads into grid-supportive loads (GSLs) capable of delivering FFR. To address this gap, this paper introduces a novel algorithm that enables automatic, communication-free, grid-supportive behavior in inverter-based motor loads. The algorithm&#8217;s efficacy is demonstrated through comprehensive simulations and hardware experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that GSLs equipped with the proposed controller can provide FFR by adjusting power consumption, reducing it by up to 32% for a 1.8% drop in grid frequency and increasing it by 10.65% for a 0.4% rise, within 1.5 seconds in response to frequency events. By retrofitting existing, or designing new inverter-based motor loads with this controller, end-use devices can automatically deliver aggregated FFR without communication infrastructure, enhancing frequency stability in grids with high levels of variable renewable energy.</description></item><item><title>Bayesian Active Learning-Based Soft Data Space Calibration for System-Wise Aggregate Flexibility Characterization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945771</link><description>There have been growing interests in characterizing system-wide aggregate flexibility to support transmission-side ancillary services and promote large-scale integration of distributed energy resources (DERs). However, accurately characterizing the power flexibility region (PFR) at the substation interface is computationally challenging due to the heterogeneity of the DER devices and the need to satisfy network constraints, resulting in a nonlinear and unpredictable geometry. Therefore, this paper proposes a network-aware, near-optimal, and sample-efficient data-driven method. First, a bus-level PFR estimation model is proposed to aggregate local DER devices at each bus into an inner-box approximated region. Second, a feeder-level PFR estimation model is proposed to aggregate all bus-level PFRs into an outer-box approximated region. A Bayesian active learning-based soft calibration strategy is proposed to iteratively and interactively learn a decision boundary of the binary classifier as an improved feeder-level PFR while providing trustworthy measurement to system operators. Case studies on a small, illustrative IEEE system and modified IEEE 123 bus test feeder validate effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description></item><item><title>Aggregated DER_A Model Parameterization via Online Moving Horizon Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945798</link><description>This paper introduces a methodology for parameterizing the DER_A model using a novel smooth mathematical representation, simplifying the process and preserving accuracy in modeling inverter-based generator (IBG). The methodology employs an online parameterization process that can operate in real-time. The model parameterization process is structured into five sequential steps, each targeting a specific aspect of the DER_A model through moving horizon estimation. This approach adapts to systems with varying voltage and frequency support requirements by selectively applying each step. Simulation results on systems with both known and unknown parameters validate the methodology&#8217;s effectiveness. The online moving horizon estimation technique accurately captures the dynamics of the overall system and ensures that the parameterized DER_A model closely mirrors the real system&#8217;s voltage, current, and power dynamics. The findings highlight the potential of this methodology to substantially improve and simplify the dynamic modeling of power systems, paving the way for more reliable and robust IBG and grid integration.</description></item><item><title>Network-Security Informed Offer-Making of Aggregator With Utility-Owned Storage Lease Opportunity: Robust Stackelberg Game and Distributed Solution Methods</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10974673</link><description>Aggregators of distributed energy resources are increasingly encouraged to participate in wholesale market bidding. However, the delivery of the power they are awarded can result in over-voltage or congestion issues within the distribution network (DN). The opportunity to lease energy storage from the utility that manages the DN provides the aggregator with a means to mitigate these issues, while also benefiting the utility in terms of additional lease revenue. Nevertheless, this leasing opportunity considerably complicates the aggregator&#8217;s offer-making process, as it requires the consideration of market uncertainties, uncertain power injection at DN buses, and the strategic interactions between the aggregator and the utility. This paper presents a robust Stackelberg game model that effectively captures the interactions between the aggregator and the utility, ensuring DN security across all potential uncertainty scenarios. Furthermore, in light of the privacy concerns of both the aggregator and the utility, two distributed solution methods are proposed. The first method follows a traditional predict-then-optimize framework and has been validated to achieve the game equilibrium. The second method employs an end-to-end framework, which has been empirically shown to yield superior economic results. Case studies conducted on 69 and 533-bus DNs illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.</description></item><item><title>New Insights on the Stability of Sampled-Data-Based LFC for Power Systems: A Delay-Interval-Dependent LKF Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981893</link><description>This paper analyzes the stability problem of load frequency control (LFC) for power systems under uncertain transmission delays. First, an argumented LFC system model accounting for uncertainties in transmission delays is proposed. Then, a novel delay-interval-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) that takes into account both the upper and lower bounds of the transmission delay is proposed. Several less conservative stability criteria are derived using the proposed LKF. Based on the stability criterion obtained, the sampling interval and the upper and lower bounds of the transmission delay are taken as the conditions to guide the controller design. Finally, case studies are conducted based on a one-area power system and a three-area power system, both integrated with wind and solar power generation. The simulation comparison results demonstrate that the proposed LFC scheme exhibits strong robustness against uncertain transmission delays, load fluctuations, and the intermittent generation of wind and solar power.</description></item><item><title>Advancing Privacy-Preserving Wind Generation Forecasts With Selective Spatial-Temporal Dependencies Extraction, Encryption and Sharing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988895</link><description>The adoption of renewable energy sources (RES) is essential for accelerating the low-carbon transition. Accurate forecasting of renewable energy generation is vital for its effective integration into power systems, allowing for mitigation on variability and intermittency of RES and facilitating economic and secure grid operation. In this context, collaborative wind generation forecasting task faces multiple challenges, including secure information sharing, spatial-temporal dependencies characterization and utilization, as well as uncertainty quantification via probabilistic forecasting. To this end, this paper proposes a novel collaborative forecasting framework which features 4 core functionalities: a temporal convolutional network-autoencoder based secure data encryption and temporal dependencies extraction module; a self-attention based secure data sharing and selective spatial-temporal dependencies extraction module; a privacy-preserving collaborative point/probabilistic forecasting module based on improved pinball loss function; and an adaptive fine-tuning procedure to further leverage feature extraction performance and prediction accuracy through joint training. Case studies using real-world data from 10 wind farms located across Jiangsu province, China, validated superior performance of the proposed method while highlighting the value of the developed functionalities. The proposed collaborative forecasting method achieves 18.21%, 15.23%, 8.69% improvement in RMSE compared to the worst-performing baseline method, in benchmarking against individual forecasting, pre-training only and statistical pre-screening based methods. Furthermore, a maximum 26.62% improvement in Coverage Width-based Criterion is attained with respect to parametric and non-parametric baseline methods.</description></item><item><title>Robust Microgrid Dispatch With Real-Time Energy Sharing and Endogenous Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10999049</link><description>With the rising adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs), microgrid dispatch is facing new challenges: DER owners are independent stakeholders seeking to maximize their individual profits rather than being controlled centrally; and the dispatch of renewable generators may affect the microgrid&#8217;s exposure to uncertainty. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a two-stage robust microgrid dispatch model with real-time energy sharing and endogenous uncertainty. In the day-ahead stage, the connection/disconnection of renewable generators is optimized, which influences the size and dimension of the uncertainty set. As a result, the uncertainty set is endogenously given. In addition, non-anticipative operational bounds for energy storage (ES) are derived to enable the online operation of ES in real-time. In the real-time stage, DER owners (consumers and prosumers) share energy with each other via a proposed energy sharing mechanism, which forms a generalized Nash game. To solve the robust microgrid dispatch model, we develop an equivalent optimization model to compute the real-time energy sharing equilibrium. Based on this, a projection-based column-and-constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) method is proposed to handle the endogenous uncertainty. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed model and method.</description></item><item><title>Systematic Design of Active Power Control Parameters for Multi-VSG Systems Based on Active Power Separation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003181</link><description>According to emerging guidelines, system operators are increasingly emphasizing three critical performance aspects from grid-forming (GFM) plants: active power-frequency (P-f) droop, low-frequency oscillation (LFO) damping, and active power setpoint tracking (APST) bandwidth. In GFM plants implemented by multiple virtual synchronous generators (VSGs), these performance aspects are dominated by VSGs&#8217; active power control (APC) parameters, i.e., the inertia constant H and damping coefficient D. However, an APC parameter design with these performance aspects comprehensively considered remains unexplored, potentially leading to inappropriate P-f droop, underdamped LFOs, or excessive APST bandwidth. To address this issue, first, by separating the multi-VSG system&#8217;s active power responses into a common part and a differential part, the analytical expressions for its LFO damping ratio and APST bandwidth are derived. Second, by aligning these performance aspects with the requirements outlined in representative GFM plant guidelines, a systematic APC parameter design method is proposed. This method explicitly formulates the feasible region for the APC parameters that ensures appropriate P-f droop, LFO damping, and APST bandwidth. Finally, real-time simulations and experiments are conducted in various multi-VSG systems to validate the theoretical analysis and the proposed APC parameter design method.</description></item><item><title>A Bi-Level Nash Bargaining Model for Electricity Trading Among Microgrids With Endogenous Nodal Prices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11006478</link><description>Determining a fair trading price is challenging, and this complexity is further heightened in power systems as the price must consider network constraints, fluctuating and endogenous electricity prices, and generation cost. This paper proposes a novel Nash-in-Stackelberg model designed to coordinate a collection of independently operated microgrids. Within this framework, the microgrids engage in a bargaining game to collectively decide a fair trading price as well as other operational decisions. We use the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) to model this interaction. Microgrids&#8217; trading decisions impact the locational marginal prices of the main power grid. Hence, a Stackelberg game is used to determine these prices. The Stackelberg model considers microgrids as leaders (upper-level problem) and the independent system operator as follower (lower-level problem). The NBS guarantees a fair allocation of the generated profit based on individual characteristics of the microgrids. In specific, in scenarios of higher generation, we achieve a cost reduction of  ${\$}$ 884 and  ${\$}$ 904 per microgrid compared with a grand coalition where only one microgrid receives the total cost reduction ( ${\$}$ 1788). Also we noticed that increasing the amount of solar-generated electricity reduces the nodal price in 1.53% and consequently the trading price in 1.27%.</description></item><item><title>Optimal PMU Placement via Quantum Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980373</link><description>Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are essential for real-time monitoring and improving grid observability. Determining the optimal PMU installation is critical, especially as the penetration of renewable energy resources increases, as the Optimal PMU Placement (OPMUP) can guarantee full system observability and reduce the installation cost. However, identifying the optimal PMU installation is a prototypical combinatorial optimization problem, requiring substantial classical computational resources. Furthermore, the significant expansion of the grid in terms of renewable energy integration makes the determination of optimal PMU placement increasingly computationally intensive. In this work, a hybrid quantum-classical approach, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), is developed to effectively solve the optimal PMU installation problem under normal and channel limitation scenarios. A tailored objective function is proposed for quantum optimization, which takes into account both PMU placement cost and system observability constraints. To analyze the observability of QAOA-generated solution distributions, recursion-based Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search algorithms are proposed for normal and channel-limited scenarios. These methods determine solution feasibility on classical computers with  $\mathcal {O}(N+M)$  complexity, outperforming the  $\mathcal {O}(N^{2})$  complexity of inequality-based approaches, where N and M denote the number of buses and branches, respectively. In addition, the proposed quantum optimization framework can significantly reduce the computational complexity from the polynomial or exponential levels required by previous classical methods, i.e.,  $\mathcal {O}(RN)$  on quantum circuits and  $\mathcal {O}(R(M+N))$  on classical resources, where R is the repetition times of quantum circuits executions. The proposed method is tested on IEEE 9-, 14-, 24-, and 30-bus systems, where better installation results are achieved compared to the state-of-the-art results, providing a new baseline for further quantum studies in OPMUP. Furthermore, a landscape optimization strategy is introduced to improve QAOA solution quality. This approach also reduces the time cost of quantum computing resources, making it more efficient for current quantum applications. Additionally, parameter studies are conducted to identify key factors influencing QAOA performance. This work is expected to lay the foundations for addressing challenging power system problems through quantum technology in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Operation and Control Schemes of Retired Batteries in DC Microgrid for Secondary Usage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964325</link><description>The utilization of repurposed second-life batteries from electric vehicles in DC microgrids presents a sustainable and cost-effective solution. However, efficiently integrating these batteries within DC microgrids poses two main challenges: (1) poor consistency among retired battery packs; (2) fluctuations in the DC bus voltage. Traditional approaches primarily focus on achieving the state of charge (SOC) balancing within retired battery packs, often neglecting the suppression of voltage fluctuations, thereby compromising system stability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a virtual DC machine (VDCM)-based control strategy that enhances both the power quality of the DC microgrid and the consistency of retired battery packs. On the one hand, reconfigurable topology and SOC balancing strategies are developed to manage the equalization current, achieving SOC balancing within the retired battery packs. On the other hand, a VDCM strategy is designed to leverage the capacity characteristics of retired batteries to increase the inertia of the DC microgrid. Compared to conventional methods, experimental results show that the proposed strategy not only maintains SOC balancing during both the charging and discharging phases but also significantly reduces overshoot and settle times of dc voltage to 64.2% and 55.6%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>V2Sim: An Open-Source Microscopic V2G Simulation Platform in Urban Power and Transportation Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10970754</link><description>This paper proposes V2Sim, an open source Python-based simulation platform designed for advanced vehicle-to-grid (V2G) analysis in coupled urban power and transportation networks. By integrating a microscopic urban transportation network (MUTN) with a power distribution network (PDN), V2Sim enables precise modeling of electric vehicle charging loads (EVCL) and dynamic V2G operations. The platform uniquely combines SUMO for MUTN simulations and an optimized DistFlow model for PDN analysis, with dedicated models for fast charging stations (FCS) and slow charging stations (SCS), capturing detailed charging dynamics often overlooked in existing simulation tools. V2Sim supports a range of customizable V2G strategies, advanced fault-sensing in charging stations, and parallel simulation through multi-processing to accelerate large-scale case studies. Case studies using a real-world MUTN from Nanjing, China, demonstrate V2Sim&#8217;s capability to analyze the spatial-temporal distribution of EVCL and evaluate V2G impacts, such as fault dissemination and pricing variations, in unprecedented detail. Unlike traditional equilibrium models, V2Sim captures single-vehicle behavior and charging interactions at the microscopic level, offering unparalleled accuracy in assessing the operational and planning needs of V2G-compatible systems. This platform serves as a comprehensive tool for researchers and urban planners aiming to optimize integrated power and transportation networks.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Planning for Wireless Charging Lanes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10970087</link><description>The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is significantly hindered by the long charging time and range anxiety resulting from slow charging speed and limited battery capacity. Meanwhile, wireless charging lanes (WCLs) and solar-powered EVs (SEVs) offer a promising solution by providing wireless and solar charging power while driving. Under this circumstance, addressing the optimal planning of WCLs while considering SEV operations is crucial for facilitating the widespread adoption of EVs. Considering the uncertain solar power harvesting of SEVs, we propose a data-driven two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model for this integrated planning and operation problem. In the first stage, we optimize the deployment of WCLs with budget constraints, and the second stage determines the optimal operation schedules of SEVs under uncertain solar charging power characterized by a moment-based ambiguity set. To address the computational challenges (due to the discrete variables in both stages and the infinite-dimensional optimization in the second stage), we develop two approximation models and an integrated distributed method. Finally, extensive numerical experiments with synthetic and real transportation networks are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed models and algorithms. Specifically, the proposed DRO model achieves a 1.17% lower total cost in out-of-sample tests than the sample average approximation method, and with higher wireless charging power rates and increased battery capacities, we can build fewer WCLs.</description></item><item><title>A Real-Time Robust Method for Post-Disaster Load Restoration of Coordinated Power-Transportation System With Vehicle-to-Grid Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994444</link><description>With the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs), vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capability emerges as a potential resource for load restoration after a large disruption. This paper presents a real-time post-disaster load restoration method for the coordinated power distribution networks (PDN) and urban traffic networks (UTN) with V2G response. The multi-period restoration problem is modeled as a dynamic programming-based multi-stage robust optimization model, addressing uncertainties of renewable generation and traffic demands. It incorporates a dynamic traffic assignment scheme to characterize vehicle travels and V2G services within short time slots. Then, an improved robust dual dynamic programming algorithm is proposed to solve the multi-stage robust optimization problem. For online application, the solved value functions from each stage serve as per-period policies, leveraging knowledge of future uncertainties to quickly guide real-time load restoration through distributed resource dispatch, network reconfiguration, and V2G assignments. Numerical experiments with a 33-bus PDN and 20-road UTN, plus a real-world 91-bus PDN with 35-road UTN, validate the effectiveness of proposed restoration method.</description></item><item><title>Best Response Learning Assisted Asynchronous ADMM for Real-Time Energy Sharing Under Communication Delay</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981894</link><description>Energy sharing can activate prosumer flexibility to support power system operations. However, in practice, communication delays are inevitable and seriously threaten the real-time energy sharing equilibrium. While many asynchronous methods aim to address this, they ignore the learnability of prosumer&#8217;s response and often struggle to balance convergence speed and stability. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel asynchronous algorithm based on best response (BR) learning. First, we demonstrate that the prosumer&#8217;s best response in ADMM-based energy sharing can be represented as the piecewise linear function. Besides, we propose a batch-fitting method to learn the BR function with high accuracy and low computational cost. Building on this, we develop an asynchronous ADMM algorithm with a practical error criterion to ensure strict convergence of energy sharing under severe delays. Numerical studies indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve faster convergence with fewer iterations and greater reliability across various energy sharing scales and asynchronous rates than existing asynchronous algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Data Aggregation Reconfiguration Scheme to Mitigate Stealthy False Data Injection Attacks in Energy Management Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947360</link><description>Stealthy false data injection attacks (SFDIAs) pose serious threats to the stability and operation of power systems, with the potential to initiate cascading failures. These attacks depend on extensive access to system measurements, and the likelihood of gaining such access is closely linked to the structure of the system&#8217;s cyber-layer. However, the role of the cyber-layer in assessing SFDIA vulnerabilities has been largely overlooked in the literature, leading to oversimplified risk evaluations and suboptimal mitigation strategies. To address this gap, this paper first proposes a new cyber-physical risk metric (CPRM) to assess the system&#8217;s vulnerability to SFDIAs. The CPRM combines the physical impact of losing a transmission line-such as load shedding or generation loss-with the probability of such a loss resulting from an SFDIA. The likelihood of losing a transmission line is estimated by identifying all critical phasor measurement unit (PMU) sets, defined as sets whose measurements can be manipulated to stealthily overload the line. These critical PMU sets are determined using an algorithm that solves multiple bi-level optimization problems. Next, Bayesian attack graphs (BAGs) are developed for each substation and communication link to model potential access pathways and calculate the probability of compromising the identified critical PMU sets. Building on this analysis, the paper introduces a novel data aggregation reconfiguration (DAR) scheme that dynamically modifies the cyber-layer structure using software-defined networking (SDN) to minimize the risk of SFDIAs. Simulation results from the IEEE 39-bus test system demonstrate that the proposed DAR scheme significantly enhances the system&#8217;s resilience against SFDIAs.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Preservation for Cloud-Edge-Collaborative Energy Management System Using Post-Quantum Homomorphic Encryption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980370</link><description>Cloud-based energy management systems (EMS) in smart grids face privacy challenges, as existing methods based on traditional homomorphic encryption support limited operations and are vulnerable to quantum attacks.

However, current privacy-preserving approaches often compromise either control performance or privacy preservation performance. To address this challenge, this paper presents a node-decomposition privacy-preserving (NDPP) method for fully distributed, finite-time secondary control in DC microgrids. By splitting each node in the communication graph into multiple sub-nodes, the method enhances both convergence speed and privacy preservation without sacrificing control accuracy. Sub-nodes communicate within groups, and the topology of the generated graph is concealed from malicious nodes and eavesdroppers. Theoretical analysis is provided to prove finite-time voltage regulation and current sharing with privacy preservation against malicious nodes and external eavesdroppers. Simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the method in maintaining control performance and power quality.</description></item><item><title>Early-Stage Anomaly Detection in IT-OT Power Grid Communication Networks Using Wavelet Transform and Hybrid Deep Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988657</link><description>In cyber-physical power systems, the imperative convergence of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) engenders enhanced operational efficiency, yet increases susceptibility to cyberattacks. This scenario accentuates the necessity for deploying effective anomaly detection (AD) mechanisms to protect these critical infrastructures against the devastating impacts of cyberattacks. Traditional AD algorithms often focus on identifying anomalies through analyzing spatial and temporal patterns derived from the physical system measurements, an approach that typically proves effective only after a cyberattack has been successfully executed at the later stages of the cyberkill chain. This reactive approach fails to respond to evolving cyber threats. To tackle this issue, this article introduces an innovative framework for early-stage AD in integrated IT-OT power grid communication networks. Our approach models the IT-OT network as a traffic dispersion graph and applies wavelet transform to decompose the real-time traffic throughput of each information node into its constituent sub-bands to extract time-frequency features. These features are then weighted and prioritized using a graph attention mechanism and fed into a bidirectional long short-term memory for temporal analysis, ultimately classifying the nodes as normal or abnormal. Our experiments confirm the methodology&#8217;s precise detection and localization of active cyberattack sites, outperforming existing state-of-the-art AD models.</description></item><item><title>Observer-Based Finite-Time Fuzzy Load Frequency Control for Multiarea Nonlinear Power Systems Under Input Delays and Cyber Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993468</link><description>This paper presents an observer-based finite-time fuzzy load frequency control (LFC) strategy for multiarea nonlinear power systems with uncertain parameters, considering the impact of cyber attacks and input delays. To tackle the nonlinearities and uncertainties, an LFC model incorporating multiple input delays is developed within the interval type-2 (IT2) Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy framework. In response to unmeasurable states and unknown false data injection attacks (FDIAs), state and attack observers are designed to estimate these unknowns, thereby enabling effective compensation for FDIAs during the controller design. Furthermore, an observer-based reduction method is employed to transform the multiple input-delay system into a delay-free one, which reduces conservatism. Sufficient conditions are derived such that the closed-loop system is finite-time stable with  $H_{\infty }$  performance. Finally, simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A New Method for Stealthy False Data Injection Attack Detection Using Advanced Feasibility Areas Considering Spatial Distribution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11004030</link><description>The Feasibility Area (FA) in power system applications defines the region within which Power System State Variables (PSSVs) typically exist under normal operating conditions. Accurate characterization of the FA helps enhancing optimal power flow, detecting anomalies, and identifying stealthy False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs). Traditional FA-based approaches assess the location of PSSVs based on discrete time instances, using a binary flag to indicate whether the PSSVs lie inside or outside the FA. This paper introduces an advanced FA-based stealthy FDIAs detection method that improves upon this by incorporating the spatial distribution of PSSVs relative to the estimated FA. Unlike conventional methods, the advanced FA incorporates spatial distribution to evaluate the proximity of the current PSSV to the expected FA in the complex plane. A sigmoid-expansion flag is employed to represent the probability of the current PSSVs belonging to the expected FA, replacing the conventional binary flag. This sigmoid-expansion flag is then used as an input to a Deep Neural Network (DNN), where both the sigmoid-expansion flag and DNN model parameters are fine-tuned during training to ensure optimal compatibility, thereby improving detection accuracy. The proposed method significantly improves the detection of stealthy FDIAs, offering superior performance over traditional FA. Additionally, it enables the extraction of key attack characteristics, such as type, nature, and magnitude, further strengthening the system&#8217;s defense capabilities.</description></item><item><title>Carbon-Aware Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading in an Unbalanced Distribution Network via a Nash Equilibrium Discovery Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966432</link><description>Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading offers an innovative platform for prosumers to engage in bilateral electricity and carbon trades, enabling promoting the integration of distributed energy resources and supporting low-carbon operations in distribution networks. However, existing studies often rely on single-phase approximations, leading to inaccuracies in emission accounting and potential economic inefficiencies loss. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a carbon-aware P2P energy trading mechanism for unbalanced distribution networks. A novel joint electricity and carbon trading market framework is developed, integrating carbon permits trading with a continuous double auction mechanism.

However, existing household NILM models often depend heavily on specific datasets or electricity usage scenarios, which limits their performance consistency across different households. To enhance adaptability across diverse households and regions, this paper proposes an optimization-based NILM solution consisting of two key steps: using binary integer search to determine a feasible solution space, and incorporating transient load features in the final solution selection. The proposed model only requires a few electrical parameters for each appliance, eliminating the need for device-level load training data. Tests on real-world datasets across multiple households demonstrate the model&#8217;s effectiveness in load disaggregation and its computational efficiency, making it suitable for practical applications. Furthermore, the model&#8217;s physical interpretability lays a strong foundation for further research and development.</description></item><item><title>RL2: Reinforce Large Language Model to Assist Safe Reinforcement Learning for Energy Management of Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016112</link><description>As large-scale distributed energy resources are integrated into the active distribution networks (ADNs), effective energy management in ADNs becomes increasingly prominent compared to traditional distribution networks. Although advanced reinforcement learning (RL) methods, which alleviate the burden of complicated modelling and optimization, have greatly improved the efficiency of energy management in ADNs, safety becomes a critical concern for RL applications in real-world problems. Since the design and adjustment of penalty functions, which correspond to operational safety constraints, require extensive domain knowledge in RL and power system operation, the emerging ADN operators call for a more flexible and customized approach to address the penalty functions so that the operational safety and efficiency can be further enhanced. Empowered with strong comprehension, reasoning, and in-context learning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide a promising way to assist safe RL for energy management in ADNs. In this paper, we introduce the LLM to comprehend operational safety requirements in ADNs and generate corresponding penalty functions. In addition, we propose an RL2 mechanism to refine the generated functions iteratively and adaptively through multi-round dialogues, in which the LLM agent adjusts the functions&#8217; pattern and parameters based on training and test performance of the downstream RL agent. The proposed method significantly reduces the intervention of the ADN operators. Comprehensive test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Distribution Network Expansion-Friendly Adaptive Deep Reinforcement Learning for Inverter-Based Volt-Var Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10975829</link><description>In recent years, in response to the challenges posed by the volatility and uncertainty of increasing renewable energy sources (RESs), numerous studies have emerged on inverter-based Volt-Var control (VVC) using data-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. However, most of these methods assume fixed distribution network (DN) scales, which may not be applicable under potential DN expansion involving newly connected nodes and controllable devices. To address this issue, this letter proposes a novel DRL framework for inverter-based VVC capable of adapting to evolving DN environments. Specifically, state embedding for expanding state space (SE-ESS) and action branching for expanding action space (AB-EAS) are designed to facilitate model fine-tuning for the expansion of DN scales. Case studies on a modified IEEE 33-bus system validate the proposed method&#8217;s strong adaptability to DN expansion.</description></item><item><title>Aggregated Modeling of Massive Heterogeneous Building HVAC Loads for Demand Response: A Fluid Dynamics Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988639</link><description>The aggregation of massive heterogeneous building HVAC (heating, ventilation and air-conditioning) loads is essential for enhancing the flexibility of power grids in demand response contexts. However, practical challenges such as unavailability of load parameters and sensor update delays significantly hinder the development of accurate aggregation models. To this end, this letter introduces a novel fluid dynamics perspective to model the HVAC aggregation behavior under more realistic scenarios that account for these practical issues. A novel analogy is established to treat the HVAC population as a fluid system, enabling the aggregation dynamics to be intuitively captured through well-established fluid phenomena. Building on this perspective, a 2-D advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equation-based aggregation model is developed. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately predict the aggregated power variation under these realistic scenarios. In addition, control strategies guided by this model can accurately track the reference load regulation signal, with an average relative error of less than 2%.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Charging Coverage Strategy of UAV Based on Improved Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10946855</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flight service platform are promising to deliver continuous required coverage to target users through efficient charging strategies. The agility-and-resilience of UAVs allow them to be rapidly assigned in accordance with mobile user status and charging strategies that require energy-efficient scheduling without compromising the current quality of service. However, as the limited coverage radius and endurance, efficiently scheduling multi-UAVs to adaptively charge, considering service fairness, and minimizing the replacement consumption of UAVs is difficult. Therefore, a multi-objective charging coverage problem is designed to address these factors, which involves the constrained Pareto dominance principle. Subsequently, an assisted deep reinforcement learning model based on the survival incentive (ADRL-SI) is proposed to adaptively charge UAVs while taking into account user fairness and energy-efficient deployment. ADRL-SI adopts a multi-objective particle swarm optimisation approach to assist different agents in learning. The survival incentive mechanism is responsible for securing the UAVs with minimum residual energy. Finally, simulation results display that the proposed ADRL-SI is more advantage than current DRL-based methods in the matter of user service level, UAV energy efficiency, adaptive charging security, and system convergence.</description></item><item><title>Averaging-Based Energy Management Strategy for Hybrid Battery-Ultracapacitor Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10974583</link><description>Considering a battery as the energy source for steady average current and an ultracapacitor as the dynamic energy buffer, this paper proposes a novel control strategy based on average current demand. The methodology averages the demand current over a time window to determine battery current, combined with rules to maintain the ultracapacitor's state of charge above 50%. However, the battery current is significantly affected by the averaging time window. A small window causes fluctuations, while a large one imposes unwanted currents to control the ultracapacitor's state of charge. As so, by optimizing the averaging window, this strategy minimizes battery current stress and power loss. Simulations under an urban driving cycle compare the proposed strategy with a sole-battery configuration, dynamic programming (benchmark), and rule-based approaches (original strategy). The simulation results indicate that the proposed strategy smooths battery currents, achieves over 75% of dynamic programming's effectiveness in extending battery life, and reduces computational burden and memory usage by over 85%. The strategy's low computational burden, and causal nature enable real-time control, which is demonstrated practically on an experimental setup.</description></item><item><title>AoI and Energy Minimization for LEO Satellite-Terrestrial Networks: A Constrained Multi-Objective Optimization Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11018200</link><description>In this paper, we investigate a LEO-satellite-terrestrial network designed to provide high-rate transmission services, on the constraints of limited energy and the stringent timeliness requirements of terrestrial user equipments (UEs). Specifically, we formulate the resource allocation problem for downlink LEO-to-ground transmissions, considering the optimization of user paring, transmit power, and beamwidth, for the sake of jointly minimizing the average Age of Information (AoI) and the average transmission energy consumption. By decoupling the problem, it develops an innovative matching algorithm for user pairing problem, followed by a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with space division and coverage detection strategy (MOSC) for both optimizing power and beamwidth. These algorithms are executed iteratively with a relatively small number of iterations. Simulation results demonstrate the practical value of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its ability to accurately and efficiently utilize limited communication resources. Consequently, the proposed algorithm can outperform the advanced heuristic algorithms in terms of the convergence and diversity of the obtained non-dominated solutions.</description></item><item><title>Energy Efficiency Optimization in Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces-Assisted Downlink User-Centric Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948379</link><description>Recently, user-centric network (UCN) is regarded as an effective method to improve the capacity for all users by providing communication service from a cluster of access points (APs). However, due to the densely deployed APs, the high hardware costs and power consumption become the bottleneck of UCN. To address this issue, we introduce a low-cost and high-gain reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into downlink UCN, where passive RISs are deployed to assist the downlink transmission from APs to users. To achieve the energy efficient communication in proposed RIS-assisted downlink UCN, a global energy efficiency optimization problem is formulated with respect to user association, phase shift and downlink power allocation. Due to the non-convexity of the formulated problem, we first deal with the user association problem through linear conic relaxation method. Then the phase shift as well as power allocation are optimized alternately, where phase shift is optimized through fractional programming method and power allocation is tackled by constructing a surrogate function. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm could bring about 375% gain on energy efficiency comparing to the &#8220;No RIS&#8221; benchmark algorithm, which also corresponds to about 165% spectral efficiency gain.</description></item><item><title>Structured Tensor Decomposition Based Channel Estimation and Double Refinements for Active RIS Empowered Broadband Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10962559</link><description>Channel parameter recovery is critical for the next-generation reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered communications and sensing. Tensor-based mechanisms are particularly effective, inherently capturing the multi-dimensional nature of wireless channels. However, existing studies assume either a line-of-sight (LOS) scenario or a blocked TX-RX channel. This paper solves a novel problem: tensor-based channel parameter estimation for active RIS-aided multiple-antenna broadband connections in fully multipath environments with the TX-RX link. System settings are customized to construct a fifth-order canonical polyadic (CP) signal tensor that matches the five-dimensional channel. Four tensor factors contain redundant columns, rendering the classical Kruskal's condition for decomposition uniqueness unsatisfied. The fifth-order Vandermonde structured CP decomposition (VSCPD) is developed to address this challenge, making the tensor factorization problem solvable using only linear algebra and offering a relaxed general uniqueness condition. With VSCPD as a perfect decoupling scheme, a sequential triple-stage channel estimation algorithm is proposed based on one-dimensional parameter estimation. The first stage enables multipath identification and algebraic coarse estimation. The following two stages offer optional successive refinements at the cost of increased complexity. The closed-form Cram&#233;r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived to assess the estimation performance. Herein, the noise covariance matrix depends on multipath parameters in our active-RIS scenario. Numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of proposed algorithms under various evaluation metrics. Our results also show that active RIS can significantly improve channel estimation performance compared to passive RIS.</description></item><item><title>EE Maximization With Imperfect CSI at Transmitter in BackCom NOMA System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948118</link><description>This article presents a novel model within a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system comprising a multi-antenna access point (AP) and multiple single-antenna backscatter devices (BDs) and user equipments (UEs), where the channels from AP to UEs and BDs to UEs are characterized by imperfections. The core objective of this study is to optimize energy efficiency (EE) while ensuring the quality of service (QoS) for both uplink and downlink users. To achieve this, the article employs the Dinkelbach method to address the fractional programming challenge, leverages the S-procedure and Bernstein-type inequality (BTI) for managing channel uncertainties, utilizes semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to tackle the non-convexity arising from the quadratic form of the beamforming matrix, and applies sequential rank-one constrained relaxation (SROCR) to circumvent the computational complexity introduced by Gaussian randomization. Additionally, for the specific case of resource allocation with a single BD, a closed-form expression is derived. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the non-robust scheme in terms of EE, significantly enhancing the system's stability and robustness.</description></item><item><title>AoI Minimization for Air&#8211;Ground Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks With Jamming Attack</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10949709</link><description>Air-ground integrated sensing and communication (AG-ISAC) networks utilize unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with ISAC units as aerial platforms in next-generation wireless systems, which can sense ground status information to the base stations (BSs) for further decision-making. Given that effective decisions rely on timely sensed data, the Age of Information (AoI) serves as a metric that precisely reflects the timeliness and effectiveness of the sensing and communication (S&amp;amp;C) process. However, recent research has paid little attention to AoI minimization in AG-ISAC networks, particularly in the presence of malicious attackers attempting to interfere S&amp;amp;C operations. To address this research gap, this paper considers AG-ISAC networks with S&amp;amp;C jamming attacks, a mission ISAC UAV senses tasks and transmits the sensed data to the BS, while a mobile UAV attacker sends jamming signals to degrade S&amp;amp;C performance and increase AoI. To solve this, we jointly design the trajectory and S&amp;amp;C transmit power of the mission UAV to mitigate S&amp;amp;C performance degradation to minimize the AoI. Nonetheless, the NP-hard and dynamic long-term nature of the formulated problem poses significant challenges. To tackle this troublesome problem, we develop an efficient solution using the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique. Specifically, we propose a twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3)-based trajectory design and power control algorithm (TD3-TP). In addition to this, we incorporate a reward-shaping mechanism to speed up the convergence of the algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate our algorithm achieves the fastest training speed and minimum AoI under attacks relative to four benchmark methods.</description></item><item><title>Jamming Power Allocation for MIMO Radar Localization Aided by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948115</link><description>As a promising technology, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) can customize the wireless channel through the adjustmentof its phase, and strengthen the localization performance and anti-jamming capability of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar. Thus, it is imperative to investigate a jamming strategy against the RIS-aided MIMO radar localization system. In this paper, we consider a jamming power allocation problem for RIS-aided MIMO radar based on cram&#233;r-rao bound (CRB) criteria. To this end, we first derive the CRB regarding target location estimation of RIS-aided MIMO radar in the presence of jammers. Subsequently, we formulate the jamming power allocation problem to maximize the minimum of the average CRB of RIS-aided MIMO radar via jointly optimizing the jamming power and RIS phase under the power budget and peak power constraints. Due to the variable coupling and high non-convexity of CRB, the optimization problem is extremely challenging to tackle. To solve the non-convex problem, we develop an alternating iterative algorithm with respect to the jamming power allocation and RIS phase design optimization subproblems. Specifically, we first transform the jamming power allocation subproblem into the form of linear programming for solution. Then, the RIS phase design subproblem is relaxed by the arithmetic-harmonic mean inequality to circumvent the complex matrix inversion, and converted into a fractional programming problem that can be solved through quadratic transformation approach. Owing to a degeneration of the solution induced by the inequality relaxation, we further propose a tightening-relaxation strategy to improve the solution quality, and re-optimize the RIS phase based on the previously derived solution. The ultimate solution can be achieved by alternately optimizing the jamming power and the re-optimized RIS phase. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Task Offloading in Dynamic Energy Splitting STAR-RIS Assisted NOMA-MEC Systems With Decomposition Based Multi-Agent DRL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10960616</link><description>This paper explores a system that integrates non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with mobile edge computing (MEC), supported by a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) in energy splitting (ES) mode. We aim to address the challenge of minimizing energy consumption over the long-term by modeling it as a non-convex optimization problem. To simplify the resolution of this complex issue, we introduce a decomposition approach using a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique. Specifically, we decompose the problem into the sub-problems of computational resource and power allocation, and phase shifting, amplitude coefficient, offloading ratio, and time optimization. Based on theoretical derivations, we determine the optimal computational resource and power allocation for the given phase shifting, amplitude coefficient, offloading ratio, and time. Then, we propose a multi-agent twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm to jointly optimize phase shifting, amplitude coefficient, offloading ratio, and time for each time slot. Simulation outcomes demonstrate that the decomposition-based multi-agent TD3 (DB-MATD3) algorithm achieves faster convergence compared to conventional centralized DRL approaches. Compared with other existing methods, the proposed task offloading strategy, which employs the ES-based STAR-RIS, achieves energy savings of 28.7% to 40.8%.</description></item><item><title>Multi-PRF Waveform Design for Integrated Sensing and Communication System With Range Ambiguity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948377</link><description>In this correspondence, we focus on the range ambiguity in the integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system, which leads to large errors for target ranging. Firstly, we construct transmitted signals with multiple pulse repetition frequencies (multi-PRF) by changing the number of communication symbols across multiple coherent processing intervals (CPIs). This approach is based on the full-duplex ISAC nodes, which sequentially transmit sensing signals and communication symbols within each pulse repetition interval (PRI). Then, we formulate the power allocation problem in the proposed system by maximizing the sensing signal-to-interference ratio (SSINR) under communication rate constraints and provide a closed-form optimal solution. After equalizing the power of sensing and communication signals, the target can be detected at each PRF. Finally, we use the target's observed delay at each PRF for range ambiguity resolution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system has a larger unambiguous area and is more effective in facilitating the detection of a long-range target in comparison to the existing ISAC systems.</description></item><item><title>STAR-RIS-Aided NOMA for Secured xURLLC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11026781</link><description>Short packet-based advanced Internet of things (A-IoT) in six generation (6G) calls for not only the next generation of ultra-reliable low-latency communications (xURLLC) but also highly secured communications. In this paper, we aim to address this objective by developing a downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system with untrusted user. However, there exist two key problems: The confidential/private message for the far user will be exposed to the untrusted near user with successful SIC; The restrictive trade-off among reliability, security and latency poses a great challenge in achieving secured xURLLC. In order to solve these issues, we introduce simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS), which provides additional degree of freedom to enable a secure and fair decoding order and achieve a desired trade-off among reliability, security and latency. To fully reveal the trade-off among reliability, security and latency, we characterize the reliability and security via decoding error probabilities. A leakage probability minimization problem is modeled to optimize the passive beamforming, power allocation and blocklength subject to secure successive interference cancellation (SIC) order, reliability and latency constraints. To solve this complex problem, we explore its intrinsic properties and propose an algorithm based on majorization minimization (MM) and alternative optimization (AO). Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can concurrently fulfill the stringent reliability and latency requirements while significantly enhancing security.</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning Physical-Layer Receivers for DFT-s-OFDM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10946833</link><description>In this work, we propose two alternative machine learning (ML) based physical-layer receivers for discrete Fourier transform (DFT) precoded multicarrier systems.

Considering data modulations up to 256-QAM, realistic 5G NR uplink evaluations at 28 GHz demonstrate large performance gains compared to reference receivers, especially when the ML receiver has trainable layers both before and after the inverse DFT. Furthermore, compared to a baseline linear receiver, we show an uplink coverage increase of over 20% with the proposed fully learned receiver.</description></item><item><title>Coarse-to-Fine Semantic Communication Systems for Text Transmission</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948386</link><description>Achieving more powerful semantic representations and semantic understanding is one of the key problems in improving the performance of semantic communication systems.

By jointly optimizing the transmit waveform and receive filters, we aim at minimizing the multiuser interference (MUI), subject to the constraints of the target mainlobe, jamming mainlobe and peak sidelobe level of the receive filter output as well as the transmit power of the ISAC base station. We propose two schemes to solve the problem, including joint transmit waveform and matched filter design (JTMD) and joint transmit waveform and mismatched filter design (JTMMD) schemes. For both schemes, we adopt the alternating direction method of multipliers to iteratively optimize the transmit waveform and receive filters, where the number of targets as well as the range and angles of each target can also be estimated. Simulation results show that both the JTMD and JTMMD schemes achieve superior performance in terms of communication MUI and radar detection performance.</description></item><item><title>DeCo-MeSC: Deep Compression-Based Memory-Constrained Split Computing Framework for Cooperative Inference of Neural Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10946233</link><description>Split computing (SC) of a deep neural network (DNN) across end nodes is a key enabling technology to realize energy-efficient and low-latency cooperative inference in wireless networks and Internet-of-Things (IoT). In this paper, we propose a novel SC framework based on the concept of deep compression (DC) of DNN considering the strictly limited memory footprint of a mobile device, namely, DeCo-MeSC. In our proposed DeCo-MeSC framework, an initial part of a target DNN (up to so-called the split layer) for the mobile device is compressed with the DC technique to satisfy the memory constraint, while the remaining part of the target DNN (after the split layer) for a cloud server is uncompressed, yet fine-tuned to compensate for the performance loss due to the compression of the initial part. Furthermore, the jointly optimal pair of the split layer and data rate is determined efficiently to maximize the end-to-end inference accuracy under both the end-to-end inference latency and memory constraints. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs markedly better than the existing schemes.</description></item><item><title>The Impact of Spectral Irradiance Aggregation Into Kato Bands and PV-Bands on Estimates of Photovoltaic Spectral Effects</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11121565</link><description>Full-resolution spectral irradiance data can comprise upwards of 2000&#8211;3000 data points at a single time step. Given that photovoltaic (PV) modeling is regularly performed with subhourly time resolutions over multiyear periods, incorporating spectral effects can become challenging both in terms of file sizes and computational burden. For this reason, spectral irradiances are sometimes aggregated into a limited number of wavelength bands (or wavebands), such as the 32-band grouping known as Kato bands that is used in the IEC 61853 series of standards on &#8220;PV module performance testing and energy rating.&#8221; To test the impact of such aggregation, measured, and modeled spectral irradiance data from two sites in the United States&#8212;Tempe, Arizona and Golden, Colorado&#8212;are used to assess the impact on PV spectral effect estimates of aggregating spectral irradiances into Kato bands and into two other sets of wavebands known as PV-bands. Calculations using the aggregated spectra are compared with those using the full-resolution spectra, for crystalline silicon and cadmium telluride modules. Each of the three sets of wavebands yields negligible errors of less than 0.1% in the spectral derate factor, which characterizes long-term spectral effects. This indicates that both Kato bands and PV-bands should be sufficient for the purposes of PV energy rating. Meanwhile, a recent version of PV-bands performs best for evaluating the instantaneous spectral mismatch factor, leading to errors of less than 0.2% across all time steps for both sites and PV module technologies, while instantaneous errors for Kato bands reach magnitudes of up to 1.4%.</description></item><item><title>Voltage-Matched All-Perovskite Double- and Triple-Junction Solar Modules for Building-Integrated Photovoltaics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045357</link><description>We designed multijunction solar modules for installation on building walls, in which all the submodules are composed of organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells, adopting the monolithically series-interconnected structures. Prior to considering concrete module configurations, we elucidated that the impacts of temporal and regional variations in the solar spectra on the vertically wall-installed modules are more notable than those on the modules installed on rooftops and in solar farms at the optimal tilt angles. As a result, the annually averaged conversion efficiencies for the double-junction (2J) modules of the conventional two-terminal configuration and other configurations that require the current matching between the top and bottom modules are notably degraded. By contrast, the voltage-matched (VM) 2J modules, in which the submodules yielding approximately the same maximal-power voltages (VMP) are connected in parallel, ensure high conversion efficiencies close to those for the four-terminal (4T) 2J modules even when wall installed because VMP is less sensitive to solar-spectrum variation than the photocurrents. The single output of the VM 2J modules is practically a great advantage over the dual output of the 4T 2J modules. An improved variant: the series&#8211;parallel-connecting VM triple-junction modules, in which the two-terminal middle/bottom modules are parallel connected with the top modules, further improve the conversion efficiencies under all the installation conditions.</description></item><item><title>A Solar PV-Based Compact EV Charging Solution for On-Board Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11029121</link><description>This work is focused on a solar photovoltaics (PV)-based onboard charger using reconfigured motor windings. In the proposed scheme, the motor windings and traction converter switches form a three-phase interleaved buck converter (IBC). The IBC is interfaced with the solar PV and acts as the maximum power point tracking converter. The IBC reduces the current ripple at the battery side and improves the battery cycle life. Through IBC, a large amount of current at the battery side is paralleled in three inductors of the IBC, which reduces the on-state losses in the switches and copper loss in the inductors. Therefore, it is possible to increase the power level of the onboard charging system as high as that of the propulsion system with enhanced compactness of the system while reducing the cost. Moreover, the applied control strategy reduces the current sensor requirements in IBC and eliminates the proportional&#8211;integral controller, which is another major advantage of the proposed system compared to conventional control of the IBC. Furthermore, the switches are subjected to zero current switching. Finally, the real-time experiment of the proposed system was accomplished using the OPAL-RT platform for 6 kW of charging power.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Methodology for Solar Tracker Performance Assessment and Energy Loss Quantification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11062883</link><description>The optimal functioning of large-scale photovoltaic installations relies on effective monitoring of tracking systems.

Aerial infrared thermography has enabled fast and robust fault detection in utility-scale PV plants. In this article, we explore two key approaches to improve inspection efficiency: increase the flight altitude and deploy swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles. A larger imaging distance expands the field of view but reduces fault detectability and georeferencing accuracy. In this work, we study the tradeoff between inspection efficiency and data quality for automatic fault detection and localization. The YOLO11 machine learning model was trained to detect defects in thermal images, and its performance was evaluated to vary imaging distances and camera pitch angles. Fault detection remained robust up to approximately 80 m, but georeferencing error became the primary limiting factor. Finally, we conduct a UAV swarm-based inspection of a PV plant, integrating automatic fault detection and localization, and compare the results with ground truth data.</description></item><item><title>RHT_NoC: A Reconfigurable Hybrid Topology Architecture for Chiplet-Based Multicore System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11026095</link><description>Chiplet-based system-on-chip (SoC) architectures, leveraging 2.5-D/3-D integration technologies, provide scalable solutions for a wide range of applications. Achieving high performance and cost-effectiveness in these systems relies heavily on optimizing die-to-die interconnect topologies and designs, which are essential for seamless interchiplet communication. This article introduces a reconfigurable hybrid topology (RHT) architecture designed for chiplet-based multicore systems. RHT achieves high performance and energy efficiency by dynamically reconfiguring the network topology to traffic variations, adaptively selecting transport subnets, and optimizing link bandwidth allocation, thereby minimizing congestion and maximizing packet throughput. Furthermore, RHT leverages global traffic information to dynamically combine Torus loops, maximizing opportunities for rapid packet transmission delivery while guaranteeing minimal hop counts. Moreover, RHT accelerates packet transmission via bufferless combined loops, extending the continuous sleeping periods of routers, improves power gating efficiency, and significantly reduces static power consumption. Simulation results indicate that the Mesh-DyRing achieves over a 40% reduction in network latency and more than a 20% decrease in power consumption overhead compared to the baseline design. When compared to WiNoC, an advanced hybrid wired-wireless topology design, the Mesh-DyRing-PG configuration reduces power consumption by 56.2% while maintaining equivalent average network latency.</description></item><item><title>A Trifilar Transformer-Based Class-F23 VCO With Noise-Circulating Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993331</link><description>This article presents a low-phase noise (PN) trifilar transformer-based Class-F23 voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with noise-circulating technology. The topology minimizes the side effect of the parasitic capacitors that incorporates an uncontrollable common-mode (CM) path in the conventional noise-circulating VCOs, and reduces the magnitude of the noise sources injected into the tank by simultaneously switching on/off the source degeneration. Additionally, the PN is reduced because the proposed trifilar transformer-based tank can provide extra drain-to-gate gain. The proof-of-concept prototype is a 5.2&#8211;6.1 GHz VCO in 65 nm CMOS.

The system- and circuit-level redundancy techniques are implemented to mitigate radiation-induced errors and metastability. A novel split coarse/fine asynchronous SAR ADC architecture is proposed to provide system-level redundancy. At circuits level, single-event effects (SEEs) error detection and radiation-hardened techniques are implemented. Our co-designed SEE error detection scheme includes last-bit-cycle (LBC) detection following the LSB cycle and metastability detection (MD) via a ramp generator with a threshold trigger. This approach detects and corrects radiation-induced errors using a coarse/fine redundant algorithm. The radiation-hardened latch comparators and D flip-flops (DFFs) are incorporated to further mitigate SEEs. The prototype design is fabricated using TSMC 65-nm technology, with an ADC core area of 0.0875 mm2 and a power consumption of 2.79 mW at a 1.2-V power supply. Postirradiation tests confirm functionality up to 100-krad(Si) total ionizing dose (TID) and demonstrate over 90% suppression of large SEE under laser testing.</description></item><item><title>A Sub-0.9-ps Static Phase Offset 500 MHz Delay-Locked Loop With a Large Gain Phase Detector</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11014511</link><description>This article presents an analog delay-locked loop (DLL) designed for high-precision measurement applications, featuring low static phase offset (SPO) and fast locking speed, such as time-to-digital converters (TDCs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). A large gain and dead-zone free phase detector (PD) is proposed. When the DLL reaches the locked state, the phase error between the two input signals of the PD can be reduced to 0.53 ps (0.095&#176;), which has an 18-time improvement compared to the conventional DLL. Therefore, the SPO of the entire DLL can be effectively reduced to be less than 0.87 ps. Furthermore, the auxiliary circuit, consisting of a large phase difference detector (LPDD) and fast-adjusting branches (FABs), accelerates the DLL&#8217;s locking process to 42 clock cycles and improves the locking speed by 4.1 times. Designed by a standard 180 nm CMOS technology, the DLL occupies an area of  $106.1\times 93.3~\mu $ m.

While various machine learning (ML) algorithms have been applied to the  $\mu $ -arch DSE problem, the potential of reinforcement learning (RL) remains underexplored. In this article, we propose a novel RL-based approach to address the reduced instruction set computer V (RISC-V) CPU  $\mu $ -arch DSE problem. This approach enables dynamic selection and optimization of  $\mu $ -arch parameters without relying on predefined modification sequences, thus significantly enhancing exploration flexibility. To address the challenges posed by high-dimensional action spaces and sparse rewards, we use a discrete soft actor-critic (SAC) framework with entropy maximization to promote efficient exploration. In addition, we integrate multistep temporal-difference (TD) learning, an experience replay (ER) buffer, and return normalization to improve sample efficiency and learning stability during training. Our method further aligns optimization with user-defined preferences by normalizing PPA metrics relative to baseline designs. Experimental results on the Berkeley out-of-order machine (BOOM) demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness and efficiency for  $\mu $ -arch DSE.

The proposed nMOS array dynamically detects the PSN and creates a pathway, channeling the PSN forwarded through the digitally controlled resistor (DCR) directly to the ground. To support the proposed power supply noise compensation (PNC) technique in wide-range operation, the output bits from the digital loop filter (DLF) control not only the DCR but also the total transconductance of the nMOS array.

The baud-rate CDR reduces the burden of multi-phase clock generation and distribution, thus reducing the power consumption of clocking circuits. A pattern-based phase detector (PBPD) is proposed in the clock recovery path to address the transition density (TD) reduction caused by the baud-rate operation. The PBPD optimizes patterns that provide phase information, increasing TD by  $4{\times }$  compared with the conventional baud-rate PD, Mueller-M&#252;ller phase detector (MMPD). In addition, the number of comparators required for data recovery is reduced by one per unit interval (UI) by sharing the comparators used for CDR. The CDR prototype fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS is verified using PRBS31 pattern, where a bit error ratio less than 3e-8 is achieved under 5.6-dB channel loss at 0.83-pJ/b energy efficiency while occupying only 0.011 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 78.2-dB Dynamic Range Shunt-Based Current Sensor for BLDC Motor Control With 2.75-&#956;s Conversion Time and 0.4-mm&#178; Active Area</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10792655</link><description>This article presents a shunt-based current sensor (CS) designed for brushless dc (BLDC) motor control. The proposed sensing system digitizes the current flowing through an external 12-m $\Omega $  resistor by sampling the resulting voltage drop by means of an accumulation-based sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit followed by a SAR-assisted  $\Sigma \Delta $  incremental analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The employment of an accumulation technique within the S/H circuit allows to amplify the input signal while effectively mitigating the  $kT/C$  noise contribution, leading to a significant improvement to the dynamic range (DR) of the readout.

However, FP-CIM with FP32/FP16/BF16 data format incurs a performance bottleneck due to the large storage requirements and MAC power. The emerging POSIT data format exploits dynamic bit width that adapts to varied data distributions, enabling using a low-bit-width to reach nearly the same accuracy performance as conventional high-bit-width FP (POSIT $8~{\approx }$  FP16/BF16). Therefore, a POSIT-based CIM exhibits inherent advantages over the traditional FP-CIM. Despite the theoretical superiority, the dynamic property of POSIT introduces huge exponent processing overhead, cell underutilization of the CIM array, and redundant logic toggles in mantissa addition for POSIT-base CIM. This article presents a POSIT-based digital CIM (PD-CIM) macro with three features to tackle the above challenges: 1) a bi-directional regime processing unit (BRPU) simplifies the complicated codec logic to reduce the energy overhead in dynamic exponent processing; 2) a critical-bit pre-compute-and-store (CPCS) CIM utilizes the spare CIM cells caused by the dynamic bit-width of mantissa to improve cell utilization of the CIM array; and 3) a cyclically alternating computing-scheduling unit replaces the bit-wise addition of dynamically aligned mantissas with bit-wise OR to save logic toggles power. Fabricated in a 28 nm CMOS technology, PD-CIM occupies an area of 1.41 mm2. It reaches an 83.23 TFLOPS/W peak energy efficiency at POSIT(8,1) for ImageNet classification on the vision transformer base (ViT-B) model.

This brief presents a modified SMASH design with an efficient architecture that includes one active integrator and three passive ones. Compared to SMASH, the proposed design achieves a flatter signal transfer function (STF) and lower distortion across a wide band. The quantization noise from the first active integrator is filtered by a passive switched-capacitor filter (SCF) before being fed to a second-order passive noise-shaping (NS) quantizer. The structure can be transformed into a cascade of integrators with feedforward (CIFF) delta-sigma modulator (DSM) that traditionally requires a high-gain block. A fourth-order DSM was designed in 65 nm technology for performance validation and comparison, demonstrating an 89.5 dB SNDR and 92.8 dB dynamic range (DR) within a 500 kHz bandwidth using a 25 MHz clock with OSR =25. The simulated modulator power consumption is  $290~\mu $  W, yielding a Schreier FOM of 181.9 dB.</description></item><item><title>Secure Controller Area Network (CAN) Transceiver With Embedded Authentication Support</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902476</link><description>The growing number of security threats and vulnerabilities in automotive and industrial control systems motivates the design of Controller Area Network (CAN) bus components with enhanced security measures while maintaining compatibility with existing standards and allowing for interoperability with non-enhanced systems. We present such an enhancement that is implemented by replacing standard CAN bus transceivers with a new transceiver that permits automatic authentication of CAN frames. The theoretical basis of our approach is based on incorporating a secondary communications channel in a virtual manner that simultaneously transmits an authentication signature with each CAN frame. To implement the authentication mechanism, a new backward-compatible transceiver is described, designed and validated that implements the virtual channel through selectively delaying the rising edges in a Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) waveform that encodes a CAN frame at the physical layer. Novel aspects of the CAN transceiver include the use of use of authentication signature generators and comparators, rising edge time-based modulator/demodulator circuitry, and phase-preserving rail converters. The mixed-signal transceiver circuit was fabricated using a  $0.18\mu $ m CMOS process and operation was validated over PVT corner cases and with non-secure transceivers to demonstrate backward compatibility.</description></item><item><title>Designing Low-Loss Single-Inductor Multiple-I/O (SL-MI/O) CMOS Power Supplies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964411</link><description>Switched-inductor power supplies are valued for their high efficiency despite the bulkiness of off-chip inductors. When designing compact systems like portable consumer electronics and wireless microsensors, single-inductor topologies are therefore preferred. Specifically, single-inductor multi-input and multi-output (SL-MI/O) power supply designs pose unique challenges that have yet to be fully addressed. This paper aims to provide design guidelines for maximizing efficiency in the design of SL-MI/O systems, especially in the sub-5W domain. To simplify the choice between NFETs and PFETs for the multitude of power switches in SL-MI/Os, which is not straightforward, an intuitive metric called the Favorability Index (F ${}_{\mathrm {NP}}$ ) is proposed. A new, optimal supply voltage theory is also presented, suggesting that the most efficient voltage to supply power switches&#8217; gates is around twice the threshold voltage (v ${}_{\mathrm {T}}$ ). The paper also proposes using dynamic selectors in gate drivers. This allows for blocking cross conduction without increasing vSUP drastically, ensuring efficiency. A two-transistor selector is recommended as a simple implementation, and the tradeoffs are discussed. An example topology is designed using guidelines proposed by the paper to demonstrate the design flow and efficiency improvements.</description></item><item><title>Design of a Contingent Decision Equalizer Using Analog-in-Time Processing for PAMN Wireline Receivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10880483</link><description>The need to rapidly increase per-lane data rates to meet system bandwidth demands has led to the adoption of digital equalization schemes in wireline transceivers. However, for short reach applications, mixed-mode designs offer better power and area efficiency, especially if their complexity explosion with data rates can be alleviated. This paper presents a new hybrid linear/nonlinear equalizer that unfolds the popular recurrent equalization architecture to remove any fundamental timing constraints in the wireline receiver. The modular multi-stage architecture drastically reduces the receiver complexity and enable real-time architecture tuning to improve energy efficiency. This paves the way for continual data rate enhancement with improved circuit performance. To ensure reliable performance in advanced CMOS processes, time-domain analog signal processing is used. This choice also enables linear energy scaling with data rate and allows proportional power scaling with degree of equalization. A 3-tap realization of the receiver fabricated in 28 nm CMOS process achieved a data rate of 52 Gb/s with an efficiency of 1.0 pJ/b and BER below 1e-4 with moderate ISI where channel loss at Nyquist is less than 12 dB.</description></item><item><title>Optimization of DTC-Based and Harmonic-Mixer-Based Fractional-N PLLs: Comparative Analysis of Jitter and Power Trade-Offs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10918863</link><description>As phase-locked loop (PLL) architectures become increasingly complex, optimizing the jitter and power performance through calculation alone is becoming more challenging for fractional-N PLLs. To find the most suitable PLL architecture that meets the jitter-power requirements of various applications, a simple and widely-applicable method is in demand to find the optimal jitter-power relation of different PLL architectures. In this paper, we propose the use of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to optimize the jitter and power of PLLs, specifically focusing on two popular fractional-N PLL architectures: digital-to-time converter (DTC)-based and harmonic-mixer (HM)-based PLLs. By applying the MOEA, we can achieve optimal jitter and power relationships for both architectures, and the observed trends in jitter and power are explained and supported with calculations.</description></item><item><title>A 500-kS/s Continuous-Time Linear-Exponential Incremental ADC Achieving 90.1-dB DR and 103.1-dB SFDR</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10849806</link><description>This article presents a continuous-time (CT) linear-exponential incremental ADC (IADC) that achieves 15-bit resolution at 250kHz bandwidth with 40 cycles for one conversion. It is based on an energy-efficient CT linear-exponential IADC, which alleviates the requirements of the power-hungry input buffer and loop filter. The proposed IADC employs a coarse 9-bit first-order IADC followed by a fine 8-bit cyclic ADC. The first-order IADC performs the coarse conversion by linearly accumulating input signals, resulting in a small thermal noise penalty. The residual quantization noise is exponentially reduced by the cyclic ADC, significantly shortening the conversion cycle. The cyclic ADC achieves the required accuracy by reconfiguring the loop filter of the coarse IADC and effectively compensating for the excessive loop delay. The prototype CT IADC is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process. With a 20MHz clock, it achieves 88.6-dB SNDR, 89.3-dB SNR, 90.1-dB DR, and 103.1-dB SFDR at a conversion rate of 500 kS/s. It consumes only 2.4 mW from a 1.2 V supply. It achieves the Schreier FoM (SNDR) of 168.8dB.</description></item><item><title>An 80 MS/s 70.8 dB-SNDR Radiation-Tolerant Semi-Time-Interleaved Pipelined-SAR ADC for Space Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10836806</link><description>In addition to the conventional ADC design tradeoffs between power, speed, and accuracy, radiation tolerance is the fourth factor for ADCs used in radiation environments. This paper describes radiation-tolerant (RT) ADC design tradeoffs and design strategies. Then, the paper introduces a 13-bit RT pipelined-successive-approximation register (pipelined-SAR) ADC fabricated in 65 nm CMOS technology based on the concluded tradeoffs. To further improve the ADC power efficiency, a semi-time-interleaved (Semi-TI) structure is employed. Besides, the ping-pong auto-zeroing (AZ) scheme is implemented in the residue amplifier (RA) to reduce the TID-induced offset while maintaining low power dissipation. The proposed ADC is designed and hardened against Single Event Effects (SEEs) and Total Ionizing Dose (TID) effects from the structure to layout levels. All sub-blocks were examined, and only the critical blocks were hardened to avoid over-hardening. From the measurement results, the prototype ADC attains an 80 MS/s sampling rate and achieves 70.8-dB SNDR and 80.3-dB SFDR at the Nyquist input frequency. With a total power consumption of 13.8 mW, the prototype ADC establishes a state-of-the-art Walden Figure of Merit of 60.7 fJ/conv step, yielding an efficiency comparable to non-RT ADCs with similar specifications. Irradiation tests validate the consistent performance of the ADC up to a cumulative dose of 500 krad (Si) in X-ray testing, while laser testing indicates a robust SEE threshold and swift post-SEE recovery.</description></item><item><title>A 0.3-mm2 1.3 &#956;W Wireless Monitoring System IC for Hermeticity Testing of Biomedical Implants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10851714</link><description>Advances in bioelectronic medicine have led to a reduction in implant size and notable improvements in energy management and data transmission techniques. Bulky titanium casings traditionally used to shield implant electronics are being gradually replaced by more streamlined materials, primarily composed of polymers and thin film ceramics. This transition offers numerous advantages, including a smaller form factor, enhanced flexibility, and the facilitation of wireless power and data transmission. However, it is essential to acknowledge potential drawbacks of these innovative encapsulation materials, such as the unknown longevity and adhesion issues that may compromise hermeticity. To investigate the hermeticity and long-term performance of conformal encapsulations, we propose a fully encapsulated wireless monitoring system with novel circuitry. The system comprises energy harvesting, humidity assessment, and passive communication. In this paper, we delve into each of these areas, presenting innovative solutions that are later implemented and tested. The final system is realized in an integrated circuit technology of 65 nm, fitting in a compact area of 0.3 mm2 ( $76~\%$  occupied by the integrated receiver coil), while consuming  $1.3~\mu $ W. All the necessary components are fully integrated, allowing for increased miniaturization and lower power consumption.</description></item><item><title>Advancement of High-Impedance Fault Detection in Primary Distribution Systems Using a Sequence Components Energy Detector</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10904854</link><description>A reliable solution for detecting high impedance faults must be provided by the existing primary distribution system.

The focus of this design is on area- and power efficiency, as well as multi-purpose usage for various catheters. It contains 32 individual analog front-ends and 12 bit SAR ADCs operating at 40MS/s to enable off-chip digital beamforming. The analog front-end is programmable in power, bandwidth, gain and can be partially bypassed. The front-end bypass and slew-rate can be dynamically adjusted to save power during a receive period. On-chip supply regulation is included, which can be duty-cycled between receive periods to power down the system and save power. This leads to a power supply consumption between 4.5 and 14.1mW when always on, or between 0.37 and 1.15mW when duty-cycling at an 8% ratio. When operating at maximum power, an SFDR of 57.5dB and SNR of 56.1dB are achieved.The ADC performance can optionally be improved by clocking the array in 4 separate clock phases, resulting in lower peak currents, less power supply disturbance and an overall linearity improvement of 6dB. The 32 channel array occupies 1mm2 including decoupling capacitance, combining low area and low power operation.</description></item><item><title>Design, Implementation, and Analysis of an Integrated Switched Capacitor Analog Neuron for Edge Computing AI Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10918870</link><description>Parallel computing is the key to accelerate artificial neural networks, both in digital and analog implementations. Our research focuses on analog artificial neural networks (NN), where parallel computations are executed with voltages, charges and currents, using as the computing elements the same devices that act as memories for the raw processed data.

In recent works, DCIM macro based on approximate computing mitigates the adder tree overheads, however, it faces a trade-off between power and neural network (NN) accuracy. The trade-off becomes more complicated in array-level CIM architecture since output channels of NN model have different sensitivities to approximation errors. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous approximate DCIM-based accelerator design framework that achieves a good energy-accuracy trade-off for a specific NN model. The framework includes three key features: 1) Evolutionary algorithm-based search finds cost-efficient approximation points by pruning the design space. 2) Genetic algorithm-based channel-wise mapping creates heterogeneous approximation methods that effectively reduce DCIM energy consumption while maintaining high accuracy. 3) A hardware generation strategy decides the number of DCIM macros and their sizes, resulting in an energy-efficient DCIM-based accelerator tailored for the given NN model. Experimental results show that employing the proposed heterogeneous channel-wise mapping significantly enhances the energy efficiency compared to a homogeneous mapping. Moreover, the proposed framework can produce heterogeneous DCIM-based accelerators that consume less energy than state-of-the-art approximate DCIM approaches.</description></item><item><title>State-of-the-Art ASCON ASIC Achieving 4.3 Gbps@0.8V and 3.5Tb/J@0.6V Outperforming AES by 25 Times</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854668</link><description>NIST selected ASCON as the standard Lightweight Cryptography (LWC) algorithm in 2023. ASCON&#8217;s implementations promise bringing lightweight Authenticated Encryption (AEAD) to resource-constrained devices surpassing Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) implementations. In this work, a standard compliant ASCON Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware (HW) is designed and fabricated using CMOS GF22FDx technology. This study provides a quantitative assessment of the HW with two other standard compliant implementations of ASCON. One is software implementation (SW), and the other is a hardware accelerated (HW/SW co-design) implementation. The assessment shows that HW outperforms the SW implementation by up to three orders of magnitude in energy efficiency and throughput, whereas HW/SW co-design throughput and energy efficiency falls in the middle between HW and software. ASCON ASIC HW is also compared with a standard HW implementation of the AES fabricated over the same chip. ASCON uses only 39% of AES&#8217;s area and boosts energy efficiency by up to 25 times. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first work providing a silicon-based analysis for ASCON ASIC implementation reaching a throughput of 4.3 Gbps @ 0.8V and 2 Gbps @ 0.6V, and energy efficiency of 1.9 Tb/J @ 0.8V and 3.5 Tb/J @ 0.6V in  $2505~\mu $  m2 on GF22FDx at 620MHz @ 0.8V.

The conventional von Neumann architecture, in which large quantities of data are transmitted between processing units and memory units, creates a bottleneck in AI applications. In-memory computing (IMC) offers an efficient solution to this problem by enabling computations within memory units, thus reducing the need for data transmission. This paper proposes a multilogic sense amplifier (MSA) with a dynamic reference voltage (DRV) generation circuit (hereafter denoted as MSA-DRV) to enhance the performance and reduce the power consumption of static random-access memory (SRAM)-based IMC. The proposed MSA-DRV performs six logic operations, namely the AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR, and XNOR operations, within an SRAM array by using a novel DRV circuit. The DRV circuit enables the voltage threshold to be adaptively changed according to the requirements of different operations. Experimental results indicated that the proposed MSA-DRV had lower computational latency (on average 29.9% lower) and power consumption (on average 30.6% lower) than did a conventional sense amplifier design and reconfigurable assist sense amplifier. Thus, the proposed design can overcome the von Neumann bottleneck to facilitate high-speed, energy-efficient data processing, which is crucial for AI-based and other data-intensive applications.</description></item><item><title>OFQ-LLM: Outlier-Flexing Quantization for Efficient Low-Bit Large Language Model Acceleration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924797</link><description>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, becoming essential to modern intelligent computing. Their large memory footprint and high computational cost hinder efficient deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a promising technique to alleviate this issue and accelerate LLM inference. However, the presence of outliers impedes the advancement of LLM quantization to lower bit levels. In this paper, we introduce OFQ-LLM, an algorithm-hardware co-design solution that adopts outlier-flexing quantization to efficiently accelerate LLM at low-bit levels. The key insight of OFQ-LLM is that normal data can be efficiently quantized in a slightly reduced data encoding space, while the rest encoding space can be used for flexible outlier values. During quantization, we use rescale-based clipping (RBC) to optimize accuracy for normal data and group outlier clustering (GOC) to flexibly represent outlier values. At the hardware level, we introduce a memory-aligned outlier-flexing encoding scheme to encode activations and weights in LLMs at a low bit level. The outlier-normal mixed hardware architecture is devised to leverage the encoding scheme and accelerate LLMs with high speed and high energy efficiency. Our experiments show that OFQ-LLM achieves better accuracy compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) low-bit LLM PTQ works. OFQ-LLM-based accelerator surpasses the SOTA outlier-aware accelerators by up to  $2.69\times $  core energy efficiency, up to  $3.83\times $  speed up and  $2.44\times $  energy reduction in LLM prefilling phase, and up to  $2.01\times $  speed up and  $2.88\times $  energy reduction in LLM decoding phase, with superior accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Memristor-Emulator-Based Crossbar Array for Object Detection and Recognition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948485</link><description>Object detection and recognition are crucial for autonomous vehicles, surveillance systems, and human-computer interaction. We present a new fully complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) circuit-based system for object detection and recognition using a Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Our holistic CMOS circuit integrates neuromorphic elements, including a leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron model, spike time-dependent plasticity (STDP) memristor synapse, and basic analog and digital building blocks.

However, current TLD methodologies encounter several limitations. First, complex weather conditions often introduce substantial background noise, resulting in inaccurate object detection. Second, high parameter counts of extant models impede their deployment in real-world applications. Third, insufficient data samples results in overfitting and instability. To address these challenges, we proposed a separated stagger registration network (SSRNet-S $^{\ast } $ ), augmented with knowledge distillation (KD) and contrastive learning, specifically designed for RGB-T TLD. This method integrates a separated stagger registration mechanism into the fusion module to investigate relationships between cross-modal features. This approach enhances feature representation and effectively reduces background noise. Additionally, we devised a joint training framework incorporating KD and contrastive learning and proposed a hierarchical distillation strategy to compress the model while mitigating the impact of limited data samples. Complementary features were captured at various stages of SSRNet-S $^{\ast }$  by employing three levels of distillation. Extensive experiments on a TLD dataset demonstrated that both SSRNet-T and SSRNet-S $^{\ast }$  (with KD) outperform state-of-the-art methods. When using P2T-Large and P2T-Tiny as backbone networks in SSRNet-T and SSRNet-S $^{\ast }$ , respectively, the number of parameters decreased from 68.37M to 15.06M, and the computational floating-point operations decreased from 26.99G to 3.01G.

The applications running on these devices rely on frequent communication with central database servers, which are vulnerable to impersonation attacks by adversarial clones. We propose NoCiPUF, a novel NoC-based intrinsic Physically-Unclonable-Function (PUF) framework for MPSoCs authentication. We re-use the circuit switched nature of NoC with path-pairs as challenges to obtain secret responses, collectively called challenge-response-pairs (CRPs). Due to the random nature of manufacturing variations, equal hop paths exhibit unequal delays. We leverage the delay differences of flits traversing in equal-hop paths to generate unique responses. NoCiPUF is fully-synthesizable and readily scalable as it requires changes only at the behavioral level. To counter Machine-Learning (ML)-based modeling attacks on PUFs, we provide a comprehensive technique and reduce the prediction accuracy to ~52%. NoCiPUF framework incurs low area (0.76%) and power (1.14%) overheads and has no impact on NoC performance in normal mode due to independent authentication mode. Obtained responses have near-ideal PUF metrics and are verified against the NIST randomness test suite. This scheme offers high number of CRPs in larger NoC networks (&gt;0.74 million CRPs in  $5 \times 5$  mesh), proving its scalability.</description></item><item><title>Hardware Implementation of Projection-Aggregation Decoders for Reed-Muller Codes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10778655</link><description>This paper presents the hardware architecture and implementation of two variants of projection-aggregation-based decoding of Reed-Muller (RM) codes, namely unique projection aggregation (UPA) and collapsed projection aggregation (CPA).

The existing quaternion least mean square (QLMS) and quaternion maximum correntropy criterion (QMCC) algorithms are based on stochastic gradient descent and gradient ascent methods, respectively. Due to their reliance on instantaneous gradient approximations, these approaches exhibit slower convergence characteristics. To circumvent this limitation, quaternion recursive least square (QRLS) algorithm is proposed in the literature, which exhibits fast convergence and achieves lower MSE. However, the QRLS algorithm is based on minimum MSE (MMSE) criterion which optimizes error-energy, and is thus not a sufficient statistic for impulsive noise. In this paper, we propose novel non-MMSE criterion based recursive algorithms, namely quaternion recursive maximum correntropy criterion (QRMCC) and quaternion recursive maximum Versoria criterion (QRMVC). The proposed QRMCC and QRMVC algorithms exhibit robustness against impulsive/non-Gaussian distortions due to the inclusion of higher order error statistics. Simulations are presented for quaternion-valued channel estimation, which indicate that the proposed QRMCC and QRMVC algorithms deliver improved convergence compared to existing approaches. Lastly, the convergence of the proposed algorithms is analyzed with performance-validation using relevant computer simulations.</description></item><item><title>UniDec: A Unified Factor-Graph-Based Decoder Fully Compatible With 5G NR LDPC/Polar Codes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11039498</link><description>In comparison to 4G, 5G wireless needs to support a broader range of applications. Therefore, both low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and polar codes have been standardized by 5G new radio (NR) to fulfill the requirements of data channel and control channel, respectively. Usually, LDPC/polar decodings are implemented by separate hardware, leading to low area efficiency. Though decoders which can handle both codes have been proposed, how to compromise between throughput and efficiency has always been a persistent dilemma due to the absence of a unified and smooth integration methodology. To this end, by fully utilizing the common parts of graph-theoretic algorithms for both codes, this paper presents a unified decoder (UniDec) which is fully compatible with 5G NR LDPC/polar codes. This UniDec enables three key approaches: 1) unified processing nodes for both codes, 2) configurable permutation networks with multi-parallelism, and 3) flexible scheduling for 5G NR parameter configuration, guaranteeing both high data throughput and area efficiency. Implemented in 40nm CMOS, the UniDec attains a maximum of  $33.64\times $  throughput and  $5.98\times $  area efficiency compared to its multi-mode counterparts. Even compared with the state-of-the-art (SOA) dedicated ones, the UniDec still maintains a competitive edge in terms of throughput, energy, and area efficiency.

To overcome the antenna limitation, a new modulation method, namely flexible QSM (FQSM), is proposed in this paper. Computer simulation results show that in contrast to the existing SM-like schemes, the proposed FQSM can provide better bit error rate (BER) performance under the same bit per channel use (bpcu). To further make the implementation of the FQSM systems feasible, a low-complexity symbol detection algorithm with matrix merging, group-based Givens rotation, candidate searching, symbol estimation, and likelihood estimation (LE) is introduced. Furthermore, the corresponding very-large-scale integration (VLSI) architecture is also proposed. Finally, the results of simulation and computational complexity reveal that the proposed symbol detection algorithm can offer the near-optimal BER performance with lower computational complexity, compared to other related detection methods. The results of the VLSI architecture implemented under the TSMC 90-nm CMOS technology at an operating frequency of 625 MHz show that the proposed hardware requires 554.37 KGEs and performs a 1562.5 Mbps detection throughput.</description></item><item><title>A Soft-Switching Boost-Type Resonant Forward Converter With Load-Adaptive Efficiency Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829499</link><description>This paper presents a fully soft-switching resonant forward converter, whose primary side adopts an active-clamp structure to achieve adjustable on-time of the main switch, and the secondary side adopts a boost switch to achieve boost-type voltage gain regulation and high efficiency. Based on proper resonant parameter design, the voltage across the resonant capacitor, as well as the drain-source voltage of the secondary boost switch, can decrease to zero each cycle, allowing zero voltage switching for the boost switch. Therefore, the penalty associated with the widened gain range is alleviated. To further improve efficiency, two optimization schemes are proposed to reduce the conduction loss of the boost switch and the core loss of the forward transformer. The experimental comparison with a conventional structure effectively validates that the proposed converter can achieve better efficiency performance, reduced noise, and lower cost while accommodating a wide input voltage range.</description></item><item><title>A Reconfigurable Wireless Power Receiver With Shared-Inductor Buck-Boost Converter for NFC-Powered Battery-Less Electronic Shelf Label</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10849767</link><description>This paper proposes a reconfigurable wireless power receiver for NFC-powered battery-less electronic shelf label (ESL). It achieves both 13.56-MHz AC-DC regulating rectification and 1-MHz DC-DC buck-boost conversion by sharing the receiver coil and power stages. Considering that wireless power may not always be sufficiently available, the rectifier employs a storage capacitor to ensure charging stability under conditions of low input received power. Additionally, a bi-directional buck-boost converter (BD-BBC) has been proposed to achieve dual-output by sharing a core with a rectifier.

Recent research indicates that minimizing ripple in inductor current is feasible by maintaining a fixed interleaving angle of  $\frac {100}{N}$  % between the SMs during equal duty ratio operating conditions. This study explores the application of these converters in photovoltaic (PV) systems incorporating individual maximum power point tracking (MPPT) control. In this context, individual MPPT control imposes varied duty ratio conditions on the SMs, arising from differences in the sources of each SM, especially in instances of partial shading condition (PSC). This variability can potentially influence the current ripple within the system. This article conducts a thorough theoretical analysis to derive the optimal interleaving angle criteria for minimizing current ripple under conditions of unequal duty ratios. Additionally, a control strategy is proposed to integrate angle optimization with MPPT control based on the derived conditions. Further, it is observed that operating the converter at this optimal angle leads to a significant reduction in ripple current, by a factor of at least  $\frac {1}{N}$ . The MATLAB/PLECS simulations and experimental results verify considerable improvements in ripple reduction compared to the conventional interleaving angle method, both during steady-state and PSC.</description></item><item><title>Enabling Long Chain Lengths and High-Throughput for Time-Domain Neuromorphic Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912655</link><description>This brief investigates the limitations on throughput and delay chain length in time-domain neuromorphic computing and proposes solutions to overcome these challenges.

A reconfigurable pre-filter-amplifier (RPFA) structure is proposed to pre-process the output current of the harmonic generator. By switching between two modes, the RPFA effectively filters out the undesired harmonics and amplifies the desired 4th harmonic. Therefore, both the harmonic rejection and locking range of the ILFQ are improved. In addition, a load tank based on a three-coil coupled transformer and an impedance-boosting transformer is designed to further extend the locking range, increase the output power, and reduce the DC power consumption. The measured results show that the proposed ILFQ achieves a 31.9% locking range (28.4 GHz to 39.2 GHz). Across the whole locking range, the measured 1st/2nd/3rd harmonic rejection ratio (HRR) is better than 42.4/37.4/15 dBc, respectively. Within the range of 28.4 to 36.2 GHz, &gt;29 dBc 1st/2nd/3rd HRR is achieved.

A customized convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed to extract the information of the linear and the third-order nonlinear gain errors of RA with dither injection. Compared to traditional correlation-based calibration algorithms, the proposed method can significantly improve convergence speed and robustness against dither capacitor mismatch. Compared with previous neural network-based calibration techniques which are commonly used for foreground calibration, the proposed method can operate in background to follow error variations without any risk of signal fidelity problems. Off-chip validation with a silicon-proven 14-bit 1.3 GS/s pipelined ADC shows that, after calibration, the SNDR and SFDR are improved from 46.6 dB and 55.2 dB to 63.1 dB and 80.4 dB, respectively. Moreover, the proposed method takes only 75K samples to reach convergence, whereas traditional algorithms require several to hundreds of millions of samples to achieve convergence ( $10{^{{2}}} \sim 10{^{{4}}}$  times faster). The implementation result shows that the power consumption of the proposed calibrator is 34.8 mW at 1.3 GHz clock frequency.</description></item><item><title>Calibration-Free Edge-Computing IMC Macro With Direct Current-to-Digital Conversion</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11045166</link><description>In-memory computing (IMC) has emerged as a promising solution to the &#8220;memory wall&#8221; problem of traditional Von Neumann architectures by integrating computation directly within the memory.

This brief is based on the analysis of the T-coil matching network, which defines the design boundaries for achieving wideband gain flatness in T-coil voltage transfer. The T-coil with capacitive and resistive loads is applied separately in the matching networks of the mixer and power amplifier (PA), enabling the proposed transmitter to achieve wideband frequency coverage. To achieve the image rejection ratio (IRR) across a wideband, two structures of divide-by-2 circuits are utilized to generate low phase error quadrature LO signals.

However, as the bit width of the operands increases, the area and latency of stochastic circuits also need to increase exponentially to meet the precision requirements, resulting in a decrease in performance. This brief introduces a low-cost and high-speed parallel approximate stochastic computing multiplier (PASCM), which takes binary streams as both inputs and outputs. The PASCM is suitable for multiplication operations with multi-bit width. In order to further enhance the accuracy of the PASCM, an error compensation mechanism has been proposed.

To further validate the design, the PASCM was constructed into Multiply-Accumulate units (MAC) and applied to several image processing algorithms on FPGA. The proposed multiplier showed excellent results in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean structural similarity index (MSSIM), with some algorithms achieving complete consistency with binary computation results, and the hardware performance also surpasses the most advanced designs.</description></item><item><title>UniPRE: An SNN-ANN Accelerator With Unified Max-Pooling Prediction and Redundancy Elimination</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11048618</link><description>The integration of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for specific tasks has attracted considerable interest due to their potential for high energy efficiency and accuracy.

However, the CAN bus is vulnerable to malicious attacks because of a lack of defense features. In this article, a novel vehicle intrusion detection system (IDS) is developed. The challenge is that existing techniques of IDSs rarely consider attacks with small-batch, which are characterized by their small attack scale and concealed attack patterns, posing a significant threat to driving safety. To solve this problem, we developed an algorithm model that merges multidimensional long short-term memory (MD-LSTM) and self-attention mechanism (SAM), shortly named MULSAM. The MULSAM model was compared with other baseline models, including stacked long short-term memory (LSTM), MD-LSTM, etc. Experiments show that our approach has the best-detection accuracy (98.98%) and training stability. Further, to speed up the inference of MULSAM on edge, the hardware accelerator is implemented on FPGA devices using technologies, such as parallelization, modular, pipeline, and fixed-point quantization. Experiments show that our FPGA-based acceleration scheme has a better-energy efficiency than the CPU platform. Even with a certain degree of quantification, the acceleration model for MULSAM still displays a high-detection accuracy of 98.81% and a low latency of 1.88 ms.</description></item><item><title>LIDS: A Lightweight Intrusion Detection System for Controller Area Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891731</link><description>Controller area network (CAN) is widely adopted in automobiles and susceptible to cyber attacks with the development of intelligent connected vehicles. While neural networks have demonstrated high accuracy in detection of such attacks, they consume a large amount of resources, hence unsuitable to be directly used for the automotive domain. In this work, we propose a lightweight intrusion detection system (LIDS) for CAN. It first filters out denial-of-service (DoS) and Fuzzy attacks through list screening, following which, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model is deployed to predict Impersonation attacks. Leveraging this combination, the detection accuracy is kept and the resources required are significantly reduced. LIDS is able to run on small hardware with 520-kB memory and CPU of 240 MHz. Its power consumption is one order of magnitude lower than the existing works, thus an excellent candidate for protection of CAN in automobiles.</description></item><item><title>Online Training and Inference System on Edge FPGA Using Delayed Feedback Reservoir</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10883335</link><description>A delayed feedback reservoir (DFR) is a hardware-friendly reservoir computing system. Implementing DFRs in embedded hardware requires efficient online training. However, two main challenges prevent this: 1) hyperparameter selection, which is typically done by offline grid search, and 2) training of the output linear layer, which is memory-intensive. This article introduces a fast and accurate parameter optimization method for the reservoir layer utilizing backpropagation and gradient descent by adopting a modular DFR model. A truncated backpropagation strategy is proposed to reduce memory consumption associated with the expansion of the recursive structure while maintaining accuracy. The computation time is significantly reduced compared to grid search. In addition, an in-place Ridge regression for the output layer via 1-D Cholesky decomposition is presented, reducing memory usage to be 1/4.

Combining HotReRAM with gem5, a full-system simulator, and NVSim, a power simulator, for ReRAM enables temporal and spatial modeling of crucial ReRAM characteristics. This integration allows designers and architects to analyze various cache characteristics within a single cache bank and address thermal-induced issues when designing ReRAM caches. Our simulation results for an 8-MiB ReRAM cache show that the spatial thermal variance can be as high as 7 K for a single cache bank, whereas the temporal thermal variance is more than 40 K. Such temperature variances impact retention time with a standard deviation of 3.9&#8211;10.2 for a set of benchmark applications, where the write latency can increase by up to 14.5%.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Cartesian Genetic Programming-Based Automatic Synthesis Framework for Reversible Quantum-Flux-Parametron Logic Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10907912</link><description>Reversible computing has garnered significant attention as a promising avenue for achieving energy-efficient computing systems, particularly within the realm of quantum computing. The reversible quantum-flux-parametron (RQFP) is the first practical reversible logic gate utilizing adiabatic superconducting devices, with experimental evidence supporting both its logical and physical reversibility. Each RQFP logic gate operates on alternating current (AC) power and features three input ports and three output ports. Notably, each output port is capable of implementing a majority function while driving only a single fan-out. Additionally, the three inputs to each gate must arrive in the same clock phase. These inherent characteristics present substantial challenges in the design of RQFP logic circuits. To address these challenges, this article proposes an automatic synthesis framework for RQFP logic circuit design based on efficient Cartesian genetic programming (CGP). The framework aims to minimize both the number of RQFP logic gates and the number of garbage outputs within the generated RQFP logic circuit. It incorporates the specific characteristics of the RQFP logic circuit by encoding them into the genotype of a CGP individual. It also introduces several point mutation operations to facilitate the generation of new individuals. Furthermore, the framework integrates circuit simulation with formal verification to assess the functional equivalence between the parent and its offspring. Experimental results on RevLib and reversible reciprocal circuit benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</description></item><item><title>A Framework for Near Memory Processing With Computation Offloading and Load Balancing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887357</link><description>Due to the increasing demand for off-chip data transfers, the traditional Von-Neumann architecture faces challenges with modern data-intensive applications, leading to the memory-wall problem. Near-memory processing (NMP) provides a solution by placing computation units near the main memory, which reduces off-chip data transfers and improves system performance. Under this paradigm, some portions of the application are transferred and executed on the NMP side, known as computation offloading. This article introduces a novel computation offloading approach for NMP-enabled 3-D memory systems, considering several critical factors collectively, including data locality information at the last-level cache and execution time estimation of the offloadable portions, which have not been collectively explored in existing studies. Further, this article proposes two different load-balancing strategies to distribute workloads among the NMP cores in the 3-D memory, thereby improving overall performance further. Extensive experiments using a variety of applications from different application domains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Our approach achieves a maximum speedup of  $2.34\times $  and  $1.91\times $  compared to traditional and state-of-the-art approaches, respectively. The proposed approach also reduces off-chip data transfers by nearly  $5.3\times $  compared to traditional computing architectures. Furthermore, the best-proposed approach reduces energy consumption by 26% (maximum) and 21% (average) compared to various state-of-the-art approaches.</description></item><item><title>Re-Meltrix: A Reconfigurable Processing-in-Memory Architecture Based on RRAM and Function Synthesis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10883646</link><description>The reconfigurable processing-in-memory (PIM) architecture has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its versatility and ability to overcome storage limitations. However, it faces challenges, such as overly complex mapping and routing caused by the fine granularity of basic logic units, and the inclusion of numerous redundant devices to achieve reconfigurability. To address these issues, we have designed a software-hardware co-design reconfigurable PIM architecture called Re-Meltrix. Its hardware architecture uses an resistive random-access memory array as the foundation, combined with well-designed peripheral circuits. Maintaining a controllable area, it integrates logic, storage, ternary content-address memory, and interconnection modes into a unified tile architecture and implements two-level independent interconnection within and between tiles. This approach achieves a single tile logic capacity multiple times that of the most advanced reconfigurable PIM architectures currently available, thereby resolving mapping and routing difficulties at the hardware level. Our proposed function synthesis, combined with the hardware architecture, specifically optimizes two-level interconnection separation and module segmentation, further reducing interconnection complexity and improving tile usage efficiency. Experiments have demonstrated that our architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art Liquid Silicon by 2.00&#8211; $4.31\times $  in performance and reduces power consumption by 29%&#8211;68%. Compared with the previously published Meltrix, the area has decreased by 15%&#8211;35%, with the area and power consumption remaining almost unchanged.</description></item><item><title>SpikeSpec: An On-Chip Learning Neuromorphic Accelerator for Spectrum Sensing With Triplet-Boosting and Hardware Friendly Loss Function</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891704</link><description>Spectrum sensing (SS) is a pivotal function in next-generation (G) multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, tasked with detecting and characterizing the occupancy or availability of frequency bands within the radio spectrum. Conventional SS techniques are hindered by challenges, such as hardware complexity and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) wall, leading to suboptimal performance in environments with high-noise levels. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), particularly liquid state machines (LSMs), are highly effective for developing energy-efficient accelerators, as they efficiently capture temporal dependencies in primary user frequency spectrums with a reduced number of trainable parameters. This article introduces an innovative field programmable gate array (FPGA) accelerator based on LSMs, featuring fully integrated on-chip learning capabilities for SS. Our accelerator leverages reward-based spike timing-dependent plasticity (R-STDP) to discern temporal correlations within the related frequency band. Although traditional R-STDP methods face convergence difficulties during on-chip learning, the introduced approach overcomes this challenge with a novel, hardware-efficient loss function. This mechanism which is also hardware friendly, facilitates accelerated convergence with reduction of training period of about 46.67% in SS classification for hardware implementation. Moreover, we implemented a fully asynchronous, low-latency, unsupervised triplet-based spike-time-dependent-plasticity (STDP) learning mechanism in the LSM accelerator reservoir, which improves training accuracy by about 3.88% in high-noise channels while enhancing reconfigurability. Furthermore, we investigated various encoder mechanisms to identify the most efficient encoder architecture for our LSM, leading to an accuracy increase of 6.11%. Our optimized LSM architecture achieved 1.27 times and 2.01 times the LUT and register counts, respectively, compared to the basic fixed-reservoir LSM on the Virtex-707 FPGA.</description></item><item><title>Co-ViSu: Accelerating Video Super-Resolution With Codec Information Reuse</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891735</link><description>High-resolution (HR) videos have gained popularity with the widespread adoption of high-definition displays. Super-resolution (SR) techniques aim to recover HR frames from low-resolution (LR) frames. While deep neural network (DNN)-based SR methods have outperformed traditional techniques in quality, they face performance challenges. FPGA-based SR accelerators have been developed to optimize the performance and power efficiency. However, most of these accelerators process only uncompressed video frames and perform per-frame DNN inference, overlooking the temporal-spatial information inherent in compressed video bitstreams. We propose a novel compressed video SR workflow that includes a codec information reuse algorithm and a dedicated FPGA accelerator named Co-ViSu. Our approach leverages the observation that non-key frames can be reconstructed using codec information and HR key-frames, significantly reducing DNN computations. The Co-ViSu algorithm employs subpixel interpolation to enhance high-frequency details and an MV-aware method to improve SR reconstruction quality. The Co-ViSu hardware integrates decoder, SR, and encoder engines within a parallel pipeline architecture, utilizing codec information reuse to bypass non-key frame decoding, eliminate complex DNN computations, and accelerate encoding processes. Experimental results demonstrate that Co-ViSu achieves performance improvements ranging from  $3.6\times $  to  $9.4\times $  and a  $4.2\times $  gain in energy efficiency with minimal quality loss compared to traditional flow. Additionally, Co-ViSu offers a  $2.1\times $  increase in throughput compared to state-of-the-art solutions.</description></item><item><title>QuantTPM: Efficient Mixed-Precision Quantization Framework for Tractable Probabilistic Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891740</link><description>Tractable probabilistic models (TPMs) can perform reliable probabilistic inference and enhance the reasoning capabilities of edge devices, such as aiding decision-making for autonomous vehicles. To deploy TPMs in edge scenarios with constrained hardware resources and energy, efficient quantization algorithms are necessary. However, the traditional quantization methods for neural networks are not applicable to TPMs due to the irregular model structure and highly varying data distribution. To address the issues, we propose QuantTPM, a mixed-precision quantization framework designed to enhance the energy and resource efficiency of TPM inference. First, we reformulate the irregular model structure into a unified format, as irregular structures are inefficient for hardware implementation. Second, we divide the reformulated model graph into hierarchical levels, so as to assign appropriate quantization bit-widths for different levels with varying precision requirements. Third, we decompose the entire mixed-precision quantization search into several steps with smaller search spaces, so as to reduce the algorithm complexity and save search time. Compared with state-of-the-art works, our mixed-precision quantization framework achieves, on average,  $3.7\times $  weight compression,  $6.0\times $  resource efficiency, and  $4.8\times $  energy consumption, while maintaining competitive accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing DNN Inference on Multi-accelerator SoCs at Training-Time</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892247</link><description>The demand for executing deep neural networks (DNNs) with low latency and minimal power consumption at the edge has led to the development of advanced heterogeneous systems-on-chips (SoCs) that incorporate multiple specialized computing units (CUs), such as accelerators. Offloading DNN computations to a specific CU from the available set often exposes accuracy vs efficiency tradeoffs, due to differences in their supported operations (e.g., standard versus depthwise convolution) or data representations (e.g., more/less aggressively quantized). A challenging yet unresolved issue is how to map a DNN onto these multi-CU systems to maximally exploit the parallelization possibilities while taking accuracy into account. To address this problem, we present ODiMO, a hardware-aware tool that efficiently explores fine-grain mapping of DNNs among various on-chip CUs, during the training phase. ODiMO strategically splits individual layers of the neural network and executes them in parallel on the multiple available CUs, aiming to balance the total inference energy consumption or latency with the resulting accuracy, impacted by the unique features of the different hardware units. We test our approach on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, targeting two open-source heterogeneous SoCs, i.e., DIANA and Darkside. We obtain a rich collection of Pareto-optimal networks in the accuracy versus energy or latency space. We show that ODiMO reduces the latency of a DNN executed on the Darkside SoC by up to  $8\times $  at iso-accuracy, compared to manual heuristic mappings. When targeting energy, on the same SoC, ODiMO produced up to  $50.8\times $  more efficient mappings, with minimal accuracy drop  $(\lt 0.3\%)$ .</description></item><item><title>Reconfigurable Radiation-Hardened SRAM Cell Design for Different Radiation Environments</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879546</link><description>This article proposes a novel and effective 14-transistors (14T) reconfigurable radiation-hardened static-random access-memory cell design under the SMIC 65-nm process, featuring a unique memory reconfigurability architecture with two operation modes, namely the high reliability (HR) mode and the triple-time memory (TTM) mode for meeting different radiation environmental requirements. The proposed HR mode provides strong protection of the memory arrays in harsh radiation environments. Compared with the traditional triple modular redundancy (TMR) structure, the proposed HR mode reduces area overhead by 30%, delay by 37%, and power consumption by 16%. The TTM mode uses the enable (EN) circuit to expand the capacity threefold in less harsh radiation environments, avoiding the area wastage caused by the traditional TMR structure. By implementing the two innovative operation modes, the proposed design overcomes the limitations of the traditional TMR structure, reducing area overhead while retaining the radiation hardening capability. In addition, this article presents a mode-switching mechanism composed of a detection circuit and an EN circuit. The detection circuit can detect errors in the reconfigurable architecture. With the proposed mode-switching mechanism, two operation modes can switch in response to different radiation environments. Besides, to ensure the normal operations of the TTM mode in radiation environments, the proposed 14T cell serves as a bitcell in the memory reconfigurable architecture. Compared with typical existing designs, such as radiation-hardened based design, writability enhanced, and dual interlocked storage cell (DICE) cells, the proposed 14T cell design has better delay, critical charge, and higher hold static noise margin.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Two-Step Attack on Lattice-Based Cryptography: A Case Study of Kyber</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10922732</link><description>After three rounds of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) strict evaluations conducted by NIST, CRYSTALS-Kyber was successfully selected in July 2022 and standardized in August 2024. It becomes urgent to further evaluate Kyber&#8217;s physical security for the upcoming deployment phase. In this brief, we present an improved two-step attack on Kyber to quickly recover the full secret key, s, by using much fewer power traces and less time. In the first step, we use the correlation power analysis (CPA) to obtain a portion of guess values of s with a small number of power traces. The CPA is enhanced by utilizing both Pearson and Kendall&#8217;s rank correlation coefficients and modifying the leakage model to improve the accuracy. In the second step, we adopt the lattice attack to recover s based on the results of CPA. The success rate is largely built up by constructing a trial-and-error method. We deploy the reference implementations of Kyber-512, -768, and -1024 on an ARM Cortex-M4 target board and successfully recover s in approximately  $9\sim 10$  min with at most 15 power traces, using a Xeon Gold 6342-equipped machine for the attack.</description></item></channel></rss>
