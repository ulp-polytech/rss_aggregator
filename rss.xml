In this study, we propose a multirelease synchronized charge extraction (MR-SCE) strategy based on the concept of &#8220;limit,&#8221; featuring unprecedented high efficiency and IC compatibility. The key to the MR-SCE strategy is to exploit the high-speed operation characteristics of electronic circuits to construct optimized discharge platforms for each small part of the TENG charge. We present a rigorous theoretical framework and simulation results, which demonstrate that nearly 100% of the TENG's maximum energy can be transferred to low-voltage energy storage units in ideal conditions, a remarkable two orders of magnitude higher than existing strategies. The verification circuit with novel structure is fully IC-compatible as it consists only of resistors, capacitors, diodes, and transistors. Despite nonideal factors, we achieve an energy efficiency of 22.3%, significantly higher than previous reports. In addition, the pathway and key technologies to achieve high-performance power management IC of the TENG are also discussed. It is believed that this work sets a new standard for the TENG power management and significantly accelerates their commercialization process.</description></item><item><title>A High-Speed Synchronous Rectifier With Improved Dead Time Compensation and Suitable for High-Voltage Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10239481</link><description>VDS (drain&#8211;source voltage)-based synchronous rectifiers (SRs) are widely used due to their simplicity and low cost. However, there are still three obvious issues. 1) The premature turn-off caused by parasitic inductance under high frequency. 2) The turn-on propagation delay is typically tens of nanoseconds. 3) Commercial SRs usually have a limited VDS rating of about 200 V. To solve the above problems, a high-speed SR (including a customized SR IC and a peripheral circuit) is proposed. A high-speed comparator together with a slope detection circuit is proposed to reduce the turn-on delay, and the proposed fully integrated SR IC is implemented in a 1-&#956;m bipolar process with a die area of 1.47 &#215; 1.98 mm2. The peripheral circuit contains the improved dead time compensation circuit, the self-driven high-voltage isolation circuit, and the power supply circuit for SR IC, and the component count is reduced by device reuse. In a 200-W Double clamp zero voltage switching (DCZVS) buck&#8211;boost converter prototype, the proposed SR can achieve a switching frequency of more than 700 kHz with minimal dead time, the turn-on propagation delay including peripheral circuits and SR IC is reduced to 8.1 ns, the isolated drain&#8211;source voltage is limited to within 10 V, and the peak efficiency is 93.6%.</description></item><item><title>An Active Snubber Circuit for High-Capacity DC Chopper to Achieve Soft-Switching Operation for Offshore Wind VSC-HVdc System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10265144</link><description>The dc chopper (DCC) is the key equipment to realize the fault ride through (FRT) of the offshore wind voltage source converter based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVdc) system. In the existing projects, the solid-state switch is directly connected in parallel with the metal oxide varistor. However, the FRT process lasts for several seconds and the solid-state switch operates at high frequency. The hard-switching operation results in an increase in the number of switches and the limited usage capacity, respectively. In this letter, an active snubber circuit for high-capacity DCC is proposed to achieve soft-switching operation. By actively controlling the capacitor discharge by thyristor, the turn-off voltage and the loss under the multipulse condition are reduced. Furthermore, the working process of the active snubber circuit is analyzed and the parameter selection method is proposed. Finally, the 2&#8201;kV/600&#8201;A equivalent experimental platform is built, and the experimental results show that the turn-off overvoltage is eliminated, and the turn-on loss and turn-off loss of insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) are reduced by 78%, which verifies the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Resonant Converter-Based 8:1 Bus Converter With 3.5 kW/in3 and 98.6%-Efficient for 48 V Data-Center Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10265293</link><description>A hybrid resonant converter with a 1:1 turn-ratio autotransformer and two 2:1 turn-ratio transformers is proposed to achieve an 8:1 bus converter for 48V data-center power systems. Compared with conventional resonant converters, the turns and losses of the transformer windings of the proposed hybrid resonant converter are reduced. A matrix transformer with PCB windings is proposed to integrate the autotransformer and two transformers into one magnetic core. As a result, both the volume and losses of the magnetic core are reduced. A 40&#8211;60 V input, 5 V&#8211;7.5 V/200A output prototype is designed and tested. 3.5 kW/in3 power-density and 98.6% efficiency are achieved with the proposed solutions.</description></item><item><title>Decoupled State-Plane Analysis of Series&#8211;Series Compensated Bidirectional IPT Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269054</link><description>In series&#8211;series compensated bidirectional inductive power transfer systems, the resonant currents are cross coupled due to the influence of multiresonant elements. This makes it difficult to analyze the system behavior using conventional state-plane analysis (SPA) method. To address this challenge, a novel decoupled SPA approach is proposed. It establishes two decoupled equivalent circuits and corresponding state-plane trajectories by decoupling the coupling coil model. Thus, resonant voltages and currents in switching instants can be derived. In addition, the zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) range with different phase shifts and frequency ratios can be determined, and the rms currents of coils can be analyzed quantitatively. To validate the proposed model, a 400-W-rated laboratory prototype is designed and tested. The experimental results align well with the theoretical predictions, and confirm the ZVS among all mosfets. The proposed method is universal and can be used to analyze other compensation networks.</description></item><item><title>Centralized Active Power Decoupling Method for the CHB Converter With Reduced Components and Simplified Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269545</link><description>Cascaded H-bridge converters (CHBCs) are widely utilized in medium- and high-voltage systems. However, they present challenges such as large submodule (SM) capacitance and complex capacitor voltage balancing strategy. To improve converter power density and reduce hardware consumption, this letter proposes a new topology for CHBC, which features centralized active power decoupling (APD) capability. The periodic parallel connection and energy interaction between the SMs allows for double-line frequency power fluctuation suppression of all SMs through only one APD branch, leading to reduced components and simplified control. This letter provides a detailed analysis on the operating, modulation, and control strategies of the proposed topology. Experimental results are also presented to demonstrate the feasibility of this new circuit.</description></item><item><title>Compact Curved Coupler With Novel Flexible Nanocrystalline Flake Ribbon Core for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273636</link><description>Conventionally, the magnetic core in an inductive power transfer (IPT) system is spliced by pieces of ferrites, which is time-consuming and unable to realize a seamless fit on the curved surface. This letter proposes a compact curved coupler with a novel flexible nanocrystalline flake ribbon (NFR) magnetic core. Compared with ferrite core, the NFR not only enhances the application flexibility of the IPT system but also significantly reduces its weight in certain power. Based on the LCC-S compensation topology, a 1 kW IPT prototype for autonomous underwater vehicles is fabricated. The transmission characteristics and temperature performance of the system have been investigated under three power levels, considering various permeability values for NFR cores. Finally, the NFR with a permeability of 800 is chosen as the magnetic core, and the dc&#8211;dc system efficiency reaches 92.85%. Moreover, it is possible to restrict the maximum temperature to 54.1 &#176;C, and the weight of the NFR cores accounts for merely 4.65% of the whole coupler.</description></item><item><title>Oscillation Frequency Manipulation in Autonomous WPT Systems With Series&#8211;Series Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10274889</link><description>The autonomous wireless power transfer (WPT) system with series&#8211;series compensation has the advantage of the output power being approximately independent of variations in the coupling coefficient and load within the bifurcation region. However, the system encounters the issue of nonuniqueness in steady-state oscillation frequency, influenced by factors, such as varying system parameters, unpredictable external disturbances, and initial conditions. To overcome this issue, this letter proposes a relay-switching technique for manipulating the oscillation frequencies of autonomous WPT systems. This technique utilizes an adjustable relay threshold to dynamically modify the phase relationship between the input voltage and current, guiding the system to operate at the desired oscillation frequency. Complementary to the relay-switching technique, a gain-shaping strategy is presented to enhance the current gain at the target frequency, thereby increasing the possibility of convergence to that frequency. Finally, an experimental setup is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. A video demonstrating the switching of different steady-state oscillation frequencies is attached to this letter.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Current Reference Control Method for PFC Converter in Server Power Supply</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275045</link><description>Server power supply has to maintain output power even under abnormal input voltage conditions for stable operation of the server. Input-voltage-based current reference control has been widely used for power factor correction converter in server power supply because it can instantly generate a current reference and maintain a stable output. However, because harmonics and noise in the input voltage directly influence the current reference, the input current total harmonic distortion (THD) increases. On the other hand, phase-locked loop (PLL) based control can achieve lower current THD due to its excellent noise and harmonic filtering capabilities, but it cannot respond to sudden changes in the input voltage. In this letter, a hybrid current reference control method is proposed to achieve stable operation of the server power supply. The proposed method ensures continuous operation under abnormal input voltages by utilizing input-voltage-based control. Therefore, in normal input condition, the PLL bandwidth design can be alleviated to achieve a lower current THD. To determine the effectiveness of the proposed control method, steady-state operation and abnormal input condition operation were confirmed through a 47&#8211;64 Hz/90&#8211;264 Vrms 3-kW prototype converter.</description></item><item><title>A TM-APSM SIMO Buck Converter With Ultralow Quiescent Current and Fast-Transient Response for IoT Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278482</link><description>This letter presents a time-multiplexing adaptive pulse-skip modulation (TM-APSM) single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) buck converter for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The converter generates 0.8, 1.2, and 1.8 V independent supply voltages from 2.4&#8211;4.2 V battery. The proposed successive approximation frequency modulator (SAFM) improves transient response without extra quiescent current. Also, the implemented ADC-based adaptive on-time (AOT) generator suppresses the output ripple under a wide range of input and output voltages. The chip fabricated in the 55-nm CMOS process achieves 93.2% peak efficiency within 0.3 $\mu$A to 12 mA total load range. It consumes only 33 nA quiescent current and achieves 150 $\mu$s output recovery time at 0-to-4 mA load transition. A decent efficiency of 70% is also obtained under 3 $\mu$A ultralight load condition.</description></item><item><title>Conditional Pulse Density Modulation for Inductive Power Transfer Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286390</link><description>This letter proposes a conditional pulse density modulation (PDM) method for inductive power transfer (IPT) systems, which can automatically adapt the generated output patterns to effectively suppress current/power ripples. The proposed conditional PDM introduces a sending current limitation as an additional condition to skip pulses, which modifies the output patterns generated by conventional delta-sigma-based PDM. Thus, the PDM pulse pattern is continuously adapted to attenuate any excited current/power oscillations. The presented modulator is simple to implement and well-suited for IPT systems with poorly damped constant voltage load characteristics. Simulations and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modulation method.</description></item><item><title>A Fast-Transient Fully-Integrated Digital LDO With Current-Estimation Algorithm Based Coarse Loop</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298786</link><description>In this brief, a fully-integrated output-capacitor-free (OCF) digital low-dropout regulator (DLDO) is proposed utilizing a current-estimation algorithm (CEA)-based coarse loop controller to achieve fast voltage droop (${V}_{Droop}$) recovery with improved line and load regulations. The proposed CEA-based controller quickly determines the target output switch-code by estimating the current-voltage ratio of power mosfets, enabling fast ${V}_{Droop}$ recovery during load current ($\mathit{I}_\mathit{LOAD}$) transients. Complementing the CEA-based coarse loop, the proposed OCF-DLDO incorporates asynchronous and fine loops. The asynchronous loop supplies an instant dynamic current during $\mathit{I}_\mathit{LOAD}$ transients, rapidly restoring the $\mathit{V}_\mathit{OUT}$, while the fine loop reduces output voltage ripples and quiescent current during steady-state of the DLDO. The proposed OCF-DLDO was fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process with an active area of 0.075 mm$^{2}$. Measurement results demonstrate that the proposed DLDO operates with an input voltage range of 0.6$-$1.2 V. For a load current step of 26 mA at $\mathit{V}_\mathit{DD}$ = 0.6 V, the proposed DLDO recovers a $\mathit{V}_\mathit{Droop}$ of 140 mV within 95 ns achieving a figure-of-merit of 3.74 ns with a peak current efficiency of 99.6 $\%$.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Design of 6.78M WPT Architecture for Configurable Power Applications Based on DCX Energy Synthesis and Functional Execution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10313582</link><description>Improving the power level of high-frequency wireless power transfer (WPT) is important research. In this process, how to make the system have high-efficiency energy conversion, strong robustness, and power adjustment capabilities is a key technical difficulty. In this letter, a configurable WPT system architecture with multiple fixed energy state (DCX) channels combined with functional execution (FTE) channels is proposed. With the cooperation of the FTE branch, the state of the DCX branch is effectively locked so as to complete the ultimate efficiency optimization. The flexible adjustment of the power level is realized through the configurable combination of DCX branches. Meanwhile, the robustness improvement and power fluctuation of the system are undertaken by the FTE branch, and the constant output is also supported. Furthermore, a 178-W experimental prototype was built, and the overall efficiency reached 93.64%.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Impedance Specifications for Paralleled DC Distribution Power System With Multiple-Voltage-Level Buses</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10236548</link><description>The dc distribution power system (DPS) has witnessed rapid development in recent years, and it is gradually characterized by multiple voltage levels, multiple dc buses, and multiple converters. The complex topology of the system leads to some serious system stability problems. Compared with the cascaded dc DPS with multiple-voltage-level buses, the paralleled dc DPS with multiple-voltage-level buses is of outstanding advantage because of the higher efficiency in the case of more dc buses. To study the small-signal stability of the paralleled dc DPS with n dc buses, a simplified small-signal model of the system is first established in this article. Then, a stability criterion based on the equivalent loop gain of the system is proposed. Furthermore, the decentralized impedance specifications for the studied system are proposed to ensure the system's stability and improve the scalability of the system. First, the stability conditions for the design of impedance specifications are given. On this basis, the impedance specifications for the Z-type converter and dc transformers are proposed, which are only related to the dc bus voltage, the rated power, and the desired stability margin. Finally, sufficient case studies and experiments were conducted to validate the proposed criterion and impedance specifications.</description></item><item><title>Time&#8211;Frequency Domain Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Li-Ion Battery SoC Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10239302</link><description>The state of charge (SoC) estimation is essential for many battery-related applications, such as electric vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and uninterruptible power supplies. This article presents a novel deep neural network for the SoC estimation on the time&#8211;frequency domain. Contrary to previous studies operating only in the time domain or extracting features using a 1-D convolutional neural network (CNN), the proposed model extracts high-level information features for more accurate SoC estimation through 2-D time&#8211;frequency domain spectrogram analysis using CNN. The spectrogram helped improve the model's generalization performance through the SpecAugment technique. The proposed model aggregates intermediate features and captures long-term hierarchical context information by introducing modified atrous spatial pyramid pooling. In addition, by introducing CNN with depthwise separable operations, the proposed model improves the estimation error score and reduces the computational cost compared with existing competing models. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms the previous baseline methods and achieves remarkable performance in SoC estimation.</description></item><item><title>A Markov Chain Random Asymmetrical SVPWM Method to Suppress High-Frequency Harmonics of Output Current in an IMC-PMSM System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10244096</link><description>In the system of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) driven by indirect matrix converter (IMC), space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM) technology is used in the inverter stage, which causes that the output current generates high-frequency harmonics around the integral multiples carrier frequency, thus generating high-frequency noise and electromagnetic interference. In order to suppress the high-frequency harmonics of output current in IMC-PMSM, a Markov chain random asymmetrical SVPWM (MRA-SVPWM) method is proposed in this article. Although random PWM (RPWM) technology have some effect to reduce the harmonic amplitude. There are still some inherent defects. Markov chain with nonaftereffect is applied to random switching frequency PWM in order to improve the performance of RPWM. Meanwhile, MRA-SVPWM changes the switching state by adjusting the vectors order and, thus, changes the coefficient of the harmonic. A better suppression performance around the integer multiples carrier frequency is achieved. Meanwhile, the principle of harmonic suppression is analyzed by using three-dimensional Fourier. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by experiments.</description></item><item><title>Digital Dual-Loop Interleaving Control Algorithm for Asymmetric Multiphase Buck Converter With Ultrafast Load Transient</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10262181</link><description>In this article, a novel digital dual-loop interleaving control algorithm is proposed for an asymmetric multiphase buck converter to further enhance the transient response under the large load step and ultrafast slew rate. The proposed dual loop consists of a novel nonlinear average current loop and a digital integration constant on-time (DICOT) controlled voltage loop, which are interleaving connected. The normal phases with average current control aim to deliver the majority of power, while the auxiliary phases with DICOT control are designed to regulate the output voltage and for the fast transient response. With the interleaving control approach, the average inductor current of auxiliary phases remains unchanged in a steady state under different load conditions and that of normal phases follows the load current level. Compared to existing researches, the proposed digital dual-loop interleaving control has robust operation in auxiliary phases and flexibility control of normal and auxiliary phases, as well as the simple hardware implementation. The proposed algorithm is constructed in field-programmable gate array and is applied on the eight phases asymmetric buck system, the maximum load step of 250 A with the current slew rate of 1200 A/&#956;s is tested, the undershoot and overshoot are 30 and 41 mV respectively, and the recovery times are around 20 &#956;s.</description></item><item><title>PFM-PWM Digital Controller for Miniaturized High-Frequency Isolated LLC Converters Integrated in Advanced IoT Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10262234</link><description>This article introduces a highly miniaturized soft-switched power supply suitable for advanced Internet-of-things applications. It incorporates an HB-LLC resonant converter operating in the megahertz range and a new pulse frequency modulation (PFM)-PWM digital controller that facilitates tight output voltage regulation carried out through a simple voltage loop controller hardware. The switching frequency and the duty cycle are adjusted simultaneously to enhance output voltage regulation capabilities while full continuity is achieved through a combined pulsewidth and frequency modulation scheme and the utilization of a new high-resolution digital pulsewidth modulator with time resolution of a single delay element. The controller's dual-loop architecture incorporates two proportional&#8211;integral compensators to guarantee smooth recovery from load transients or input voltage aberrations. The controller accounts for the nonmonotonicity attribute of asymmetrically driven LLC resonant converters by carrying out dedicated mitigation sequences for low-Q operation. The operation of the controller is experimentally verified on a 3&#8211;7 V input HB-LLC converter, demonstrating excellent voltage regulation capabilities and significant reduction of the passive components&#8217; stress during startup.</description></item><item><title>Seamless Control of Full-Bridge and Half-Bridge Topology Morphing LLC Converter Based on State Plane Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10264164</link><description>The topology morphing (TPM) strategy, which involves switching between full-bridge and half-bridge modes, offers a promising solution to broaden the voltage gain range of LLC converters without adding an extra device. However, due to the distinct voltage gain curves of these two modes, the existence of a stable operating point after TPM is not promised, resulting in system instability. To address this issue, this article proposes a design procedure based on peak gain trajectory, incorporating geometrically simplified steady-state state plane analysis. In this way, the predicted result shows a great agreement with the exact peak gain trajectory. In addition, a state plane&#8211;based topology morphing control (SPTMC) is introduced to mitigate significant output voltage transients caused by the abrupt TPM. With such a strategy, the desired switching frequency after TPM is forecasted and feedforward to the conventional linear control to ensure tight regulation of the output voltage during TPM. It is noted that neither a lookup table nor control scheme switching is required for the proposed control strategy. A prototype has been constructed to validate the feasibility of the proposed design procedure and the proposed SPTMC.</description></item><item><title>A Scalable Self-Powered Balancing Circuit for High-Step-Down-Ratio Auxiliary Power Supply</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269048</link><description>This article proposes a new auxiliary power supply solution for medium-voltage converters using a unidirectional-balancing-cell-based approach. The proposed approach reduces the number of active devices and required driving circuitry by half compared with existing voltage-balancing circuit designs. In addition, it significantly reduces the size of the resonant tank by decoupling the $LC$ resonant frequency from the switching frequency. The proposed solution is scalable and adaptable to different voltage levels. Each balancing cell operates independently in a self-powered manner, enhancing reliability and simplicity. The balancing cells are connected in an interleaved manner, enabling a step-down ratio of $(n+1):1$ for $n$ cells. A 6 to $1 \,\mathrm{kV}$ prototype is presented to verify the proposed concept. To meet the voltage requirement for the auxiliary power in a medium-voltage system, a two-stage high step-down converter was developed. The converter is capable of converting 6 to $48 \,\mathrm{V}$ and is constructed using the proposed converter as the first stage and commercial power supplies as the second stage.</description></item><item><title>Model-Free Predictive Control of DC&#8211;DC Boost Converters: Sensor Noise Suppression With Hybrid Extended State Observers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268638</link><description>DC&#8211;DC boost converters find versatile application as power conversion interfaces to renewable energy sources including wind, solar photovoltaic, fuel cell, and energy storage systems. The model predictive control (MPC) of these power converters is characterized by multivariable, constrained, optimal control with higher performance than linear control methods. However, MPC is limited by sensor measurement noise and model uncertainties. Although model-free predictive control based on the ultralocal model and conventional extended state observer (MFPC-ESO) can mitigate model uncertainties, MFPC-ESO is limited in noise suppression. Noise suppression is an important control objective in order to keep the steady state ripples bounded and guarantee the stability and robust performance of power converters. Therefore, this study proposes the novel hybrid parallel-cascade ESO, which has better measurement noise suppression than the conventional linear ESO. New higher order hybrid ESO structures are also discussed along with their detailed theoretical analyses. The generalized selection and design guidelines for robust control with measurement noise suppression using hybrid ESOs (including cascade-parallel ESO) are presented. The proposed control schemes are experimentally demonstrated for the robust MFPC of a bidirectional dc&#8211;dc boost power converter, under conditions including load, input voltage, measurement noise, and model uncertainties.</description></item><item><title>Simultaneous Power and Data Modulation Scheme for LLC Resonant Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268632</link><description>Power and signal dual modulation (PSDM) integrates communication functions in power converters, providing an appropriate communication method for power electronics systems.

Conventionally, sensorless SR methods turn on secondary-side switches at the same instant as the primary side. In such conditions, secondary-side switches usually operate under hard turn-on conditions due to the existence of output capacitors ${C}_{\text{oss}}$. In this article, the mechanism of ${C}_{\text{oss}}$ causing secondary-side hard switching under conventional sensorless SR is analyzed comprehensively. Actual operating process considering the effect of ${C}_{\text{oss}}$ is analyzed and modeled using the state trajectory method. To realize soft turn-on on the secondary side, a switching delay strategy is proposed. The proposed strategy delays the turn-on instant of secondary-side switches to help realize secondary-side zero voltage switching (ZVS) conditions. A quantitative state trajectory model is also established for the proposed strategy, and a searching method for suitable switching delay time is also provided. With searched switching delay time, the proposed strategy can guarantee secondary-side ZVS condition for sensorless SR in full load range, improving efficiency. A lab-level prototype was built to verify the proposed switching delay strategy. The experimental results prove the correctness of the proposed state trajectory analysis and show that sensorless SR with the proposed switching delay strategy can achieve an obvious efficiency improvement (up to 3.61%) over conventional sensorless SR method in full load range, especially when the load is light.</description></item><item><title>A Multipulsed Power Source With Rectangularity Improvement for Magnetic Resonance Sounding</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10271731</link><description>The rectangular pulsed power source is the key component of the pulse magnetic resonance sounding system, which requires high amplitude, short trailing time, and low amplitude decrease. Switching mode topologies, especially full-bridge topologies, are widely used to generate pulsed current. However, due to the complex pulse shape, the supply voltage drop in the traditional scheme leads to a sharp decrease in current amplitude and severe residual ringing. In this article, a phase-shifted full-bridge control model is designed based on the single-period energy calculation method, which can effectively maintain the stability of pulse amplitude when input voltage drops. Furthermore, a load-damping coefficient adjustment network based on short-circuit resistors is also applied for the fast turn-off. As a result, the control strategy for generating multipulse with rectangularity improvement is proposed. Experiment results show that the peak value of the rectangular current pulse is 236.5 A, the trailing time of residual current is about 0.4 ms, and the current amplitude decrease is only about 2% for a single pulse. The waveform quality is significantly improved, which supports the detection of deep groundwater and multiple parameters in MRS systems.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Finite-Set Sliding-Mode Model-Free Predictive Current Control for PMSM Drives Without DC-Link Voltage Sensor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273440</link><description>Model predictive control (MPC) has attracted a lot of attention for power converters and motor drives in the last decade, owing to its merits such as explicit concept, excellent dynamic performance, and decent applicability in digital implementation. However, as a model-based method, classical MPC is heavily dependent on the system parameters of the plant under control. In this article, a novel finite-set sliding-mode model-free predictive current control (FS-SM-MFPCC) is proposed for permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) drives, which combines the theory of sliding-mode control with MPC. The proposed strategy is thoroughly model-free, irrelevant for the dc-link voltage, and computationally light. The original version of the suggested strategy suffers from two flaws: 1) poor steady-state performance and 2) existent tracking errors, which are solved by using a simple correction algorithm and an extended control set coordinating with an improved cost function, respectively. The comparatively experimental results based on a 500-W PMSM drive are given to confirm the benefits of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Control Design of Passive Grid-Forming Inverters in Port-Hamiltonian Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273433</link><description>This article presents a modified dispatchable virtual oscillator control approach for achieving the passivity of grid-forming inverters (GFMs), without assuming constant voltage and constant frequency. The proposed control framework utilizes the port-Hamiltonian (PH)&#8211;based structure that mimics the behaviors of coupled harmonic oscillators, along with an energy &#8220;pumping-or-damping&#8221; block and the control by interconnection technique, to render the inverter passive. Once passivity is achieved, the transient stability of the system will be guaranteed. The proposed control framework is composed of three loops: an outer power dispatching loop that generates the voltage and frequency references, a virtual oscillator loop that emulates the spontaneous synchronization of oscillators, and an inductor current loop that maintains lossless interconnection in PH systems. The study shows that the proposed control approach ensures the passivity of GFMs, facilitating the transient stability design of multi-inverter systems, as interconnections of passive systems remain passive and stable.</description></item><item><title>Complex Vector-Based Stability Analysis of the High-Speed Electric Motor Emulator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275107</link><description>Electric motor emulator (EME) is being increasingly utilized during the development and test process of motor drive units (MDUs) for electric vehicle applications. However, the high-speed instability issue, without sufficient corresponding theoretical analysis currently, limits its further application. Hence, a comprehensive modeling and stability analysis approach for the high-speed EME is presented here to enrich the understanding of this special power hardware-in-the-loop testing scenario. A detailed model of the EME testing system with MDU included is developed in complex vector (CV) form for the first time, the poles loci of which are then plotted for accurately predicting the system stability. Influences of various factors including control bandwidth, time delay, and control structure on the speed limit of the EME are investigated, with parameter nonlinearities in the motor model also considered to demonstrate the extended applicability of the CV-based modeling approach. The maximum error between the predicted speed limits and the experimental results is less than 20 Hz, and the EME running up to 800 Hz is also experimentally achieved by adopting the internal model control structure, both validating the effectiveness and accuracy of the presented CV modeling and stability analysis approach for the high-speed EME.</description></item><item><title>New Perspectives and Systematic Approaches for Analyzing Negative Damping-Induced Sustained Oscillation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10275028</link><description>Sustained oscillations (SOs) are commonly observed in systems dominated by converters. Under specific conditions, even though the origin of SOs can be identified through negative damping modes using conventional linear analysis, utilizing the describing function to compute harmonic amplitude and frequency remains incomplete. This is because a) it can not cover the cases where hard limits are not triggered, and b) it can not provide a complete trajectory for authentic linear analysis to confirm the presence of SO. Hence, two analytical methods are proposed by returning to the essential principle of harmonic balance. a) A dedicated approach is proposed to solve steady-state harmonics via Newton&#8211;Raphson iteration with carefully chosen initial values. The method encompasses all potential hard limit triggered cases. b) By employing extended multiharmonic linearization theory and considering loop impedance, an authentic linear analysis of SO is conducted. The analysis indicates that the initial negative damping modes transform into multiple positive damping modes as SO develops. Simulation validations are performed on a two-level voltage source converter using both PSCAD and RT-LAB. Additionally, valuable insights into the work are addressed considering the modularity and scalability of the proposed methods.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Control Scheme for the Electric Motor Emulator to Improve the Voltage Emulation Accuracy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278473</link><description>An electric motor emulator (EME) is being prevalently used during the testing process of the motor drive unit for electric vehicle applications. Most of the existing research works focus on the improvement and analysis of the terminal current emulation accuracy of the EME, whereas research on the emulation accuracy of the EME terminal voltage is rare. The purpose of this article is to cope with the distortion of the EMEs terminal voltage at high modulation index due to the parasitic capacitance and deadtime of the emulator converter. A novel control scheme based on an active circulation regulation approach and a switched-mode modulation strategy is proposed in this article. The proposed control scheme is aimed at the commercial EME with the parallel-branch converter. Both simulations and experiments are carried out based on a prototype power topology, validating the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme in improving the voltage emulation accuracy of the EME.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Implementation of Predictive Control in Power Inverters Based on Nearest Neighbor Searching</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278440</link><description>Model predictive control is a powerful methodology to control multilevel power inverters because of its ability to deal with multiple variables and control objectives but presents some difficulties, such as high computational burden and the fact that the control input is held constant during each sampling period. Multirate model predictive control was later proposed to alleviate the latter issue but would become even more complex to compute. This work proposes the implementation of multirate model predictive control using a novel adaptation of nearest neighbor searching to learn the control law. This effort made it possible for this control technique to be implemented in real time by taking advantage of hardware-accelerated parallelization. The method is tested on a five-level diode-clamped converter operating in inverter mode. The algorithm was implemented in a field-programmable-gate-array-in-the-loop experiment, and results show a significant reduction in total harmonic distortion, improving current ripples compared to predictive control that does not use the multirate technique.</description></item><item><title>A Compact Single-Phase Cascaded Three-Level AC/DC Converter With Variable DC Bus Voltage and Low CM Noise</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10283948</link><description>This article proposes a new topology technology of a two-stage ac/dc converter with variable dc bus voltage control. The technology is a cascaded combination of a new type of single-inductor-based cascaded three-level totem-pole power-factor-correction (PFC) circuit and a three-level LLC half-bridge converter. Although the existing variable dc bus voltage control strategy based on a two-level ac/dc converter exhibits better overall efficiency than fixed dc bus control, it faces problems such as high withstand voltage stress of the power semiconductor device and large inductance volt-second product and filter volume. In order to address these issues, a novel cascaded three-level ac/dc converter with 600 V withstand voltage devices and phase-shift modulation technology is proposed. The new single-inductor-based mirror-symmetric cascaded three-level totem-pole PFC can achieve low common-mode electromagnetic interference without relying on impedance balance. As verification of the proof-of-concept, a hardware prototype of a scale-down 1 kW ac/dc converter is developed. The experimental results show that the converter can operate in an ultrawide battery terminal voltage range of 220&#8211;420 V, with a peak efficiency of 96.35%, and a power density of 28% higher than the traditional two-level converter.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Stabilization of APF Systems Considering Dynamic of Nonlinear Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286082</link><description>The active power filter (APF) is effective for harmonic suppression. But it may cause harmonic oscillation under certain source-load conditions. This article analyzes the harmonic oscillation and its stabilization. The dynamics of the APF's current control and the nonlinear load's frequency coupling effect are considered, which are normally ignored in existing research. It is found that the frequency coupling effect makes symmetric harmonics (&#8722;5th/7th, &#8722;11th/13th, for example) share their harmonic dynamics and oscillate or converge together. And the APF's current controller can provide harmonic damping. Then two regular harmonic stabilizing methods, harmonic suppressing ratio reducing (SRR) and harmonic virtual admittance (HVA) control, are reassessed considering the nonlinear load. Analyzing results show that frequency coupling caused by the nonlinear load has different impacts on the SRR and HVA, which provides theoretical guidance for choosing or designing stabilizing strategies. Models in this article are verified by frequency-sweeping simulation, and analyzing conclusions about the oscillation features and stabilizing methods are verified by both simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>A Full-Range and High-Dynamic Control Method of Neutral Point Potential for Parallel Three Level Inverters Considering Zero-Sequence Circulating Current</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288426</link><description>Parallel three-level inverters (PTLIs) are widely used in high-power applications to improve the system capacity and reliability. However, the three-level topology in PTLIs inevitably introduces the imbalance of neutral-point potential (NPP), and the NPP control (NPPC) of PTLIs must consider zero-sequence circulating current (ZSCC). The existence of ZSCC may cause the failure of NPPC methods for a single TLI to be directly applied to PTLIs. To solve this issue, a full-range and high-dynamic control method of NPP for PTLIs considering ZSCC is proposed in this article. First, the independent zero-sequence voltage injection (ZSVI) method is extended to PTLIs with the consideration of ZSCC. Meanwhile, treating PTLIs as one six-phase TLI for NPPC is proposed in this article, and the uniform ZSVI method for PTLIs is analyzed in detail. Based on the uniform ZSVI method, the modulation wave decomposition (MWD) method is implemented to balance NPP in the full modulation index range. Furthermore, to improve the dynamic performance of NPPC, an online neutral compensation current estimation (ONCCE) method combining a proportional regulator and a nonlinear disturbance observer is proposed. Combining the uniform ZSVI, MWD, and ONCCE methods organically, the full-range and high-dynamic NPPC is achieved, and the balance effect, control range, and dynamic performance are obviously improved. The experimental results obtained from an industry prototype of PTLIs verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Stability Analysis and Interaction-Rule-Based Optimization of Multisource and Multiload DC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290917</link><description>Coupling interaction within multisource and multiload (MSML) challenges the stable operation of dc microgrids. To disclose the essential mechanism, a detailed small-signal model of the MSML dc microgrid is established first. Then, the relations between coupling parameters and stability margin are investigated using modal analysis and participation factor. Two important corollaries are discovered: 1) in a three-source system, when the sources distribute in the two long and one short of the transmission lines, the system can achieve the largest stability margin; and 2) the increase of power sources will induce an impedance augmentation effect and improve the stability margin. Thus, an interaction-rule-based optimization method is proposed to adjust the controller parameters, which can not only raise damping and improve stability margin but also provide inertia for the system. Substantial theoretical analyses and hardware-in-the-loop experiments further verify these findings and the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Low-Frequency Voltage Ripple Suppression for MMCs With Split-Capacitor Submodules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10294208</link><description>This article proposes a split-capacitor submodule (SC-SM) based active power decoupling scheme to suppress the fundamental and double-frequency voltage ripples in modular multilevel converter (MMC) submodules (SMs) and reduce the capacitance required by the system. The operating principle is delicately analyzed to reveal the constraints for the SC-SM and establish the theoretical model showing the nonlinearity of the SC-SM. An asymmetric split-capacitor power decoupling scheme is proposed and the corresponding parameter is designed according to the constraints and operating principles. An easy-to-implement double closed-loop control strategy is proposed based on the decoupled and simplified SC-SM model developed. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed scheme are experimentally verified. The experimental results show that the SC-SM does not affect the steady-state performance and transients during load changes of the MMC system. The low-frequency voltage fluctuation of the SC-SM is significantly reduced by 88% compared with the conventional MMC with half-bridge SMs. The voltage ripple content with respect to the dc voltage can be reduced to 2.02%.</description></item><item><title>Synthesis of Interleaved, Unipolar, Switched Capacitor DC&#8211;DC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298790</link><description>Switched capacitor (SC) dc&#8211;dc converters are showing great potential for new applications such as data centres, electric vehicles, and power transmission. Many SC topologies have been synthesized on an ad-hoc basis, although new computer methods are being introduced to formalize this process. This article presents a general synthesis technique that can be incorporated into a computer algorithm to assist with the development of new SC circuits. The technique is based on interleaving SC converter circuits, where two unipolar converters are connected in parallel, and each leg is driven by separate, complementary gate signals. By applying this method to the traditional Ladder SC converter, a topology termed a simplified interleaved ladder (SIL) converter, is synthesized and tested using a hardware prototype. The resonant implementation of the SIL converter has desirable features for MV/LV applications when compared with other existing SC circuits.</description></item><item><title>PCB-on-DBC GaN Power Module Design With High-Density Integration and Double-Sided Cooling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10239540</link><description>Lateral gallium nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistors present better electrical characteristics compared to silicon or silicon carbide devices such as high switching speed and low gate charge, but also present additional challenges on the module design.

GaN's inherent material properties allow for the development of power electronics with improved performance, such as efficiency, power density, and weight. However, GaN high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) exhibit a parasitic phenomenon of time-varying on-resistance, known as dynamic on-resistance or &#8220;current collapse,&#8221; largely due to charge trapping and hot-electron injection in undesirable locations of the device structure. Evaluating and characterizing this phenomenon based on GaN's intended operating conditions is crucial to perform design tradeoff studies for target applications. Therefore, this article provides an extensive review of prior research related to GaN dynamic on-resistance, while identifying limitations, challenges, and opportunities based on a survey of the state-of-the-art approaches in literature. Converter-based dynamic operations can create electric fields and leakage paths that are not seen in dc operation, which can lead to serious reliability concerns that should be factored into a device design optimal for power electronic applications. In light of understanding time-dependent stress effects linked to dynamic on-resistance, this article provides several simulation studies analyzing field distribution on the field plates when varying voltage stress slew rates are applied. Such simulation studies seek to identify key elements and analysis missing in prior literature and foreshadow the importance of the research topic to realize the true dynamic behavior of on-resistance in GaN HEMTs.</description></item><item><title>Automated Extraction of Low-Order Thermal Model With Controllable Error Bounds for SiC MOSFET Power Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10262232</link><description>This article explores modeling the thermal process of a Silicon carbide (SiC) metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (mosfet) power module through a finite element analysis (FEA) based full-order thermal model (FOM) and then reducing the order of the FEA thermal model using a hybrid model order reduction (MOR) method. This hybrid MOR method takes advantage of Krylov subspace projection method's ability to be applied to higher order systems and the controllable error bound of the Hankel singular value based MOR method using a pure mathematical approximation process without any heuristic assumption. The resulting reduced-order thermal model has a significantly reduced computation cost compared to the FEA model while preserving the accuracy of the FEA model with controllable error bounds. The proposed method is applied to a SiC mosfet power module to generate reduced-order thermal models, which are validated by computer simulation with respect to the FEA thermal model and are compared with a state-of-the-art three-dimensional thermal equivalent circuit model and the reduced-order thermal models generated by using a Krylov subspace projection method. Experimental validation of the thermal models with respect to the measured SiC mosfet junction temperature is provided. The results demonstrate higher accuracy and controllable error bound of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Accurate Multiport Network Model for Forced Oscillations Analysis and Suppression of Multichip IGBT Power Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286851</link><description>In this article, a multiport network approach is proposed to analyze the forced oscillations issue for the multichips power module. First, experimental results indicate the presence of multiple resonance points caused by forced oscillations during the switching process of multichip power modules. Due to the complex distribution of parasitic parameters within the module, it is challenging to establish an accurate analytical model. Therefore, this article proposes a method based on multisoftware collaborative simulation to extract the corresponding impedance of different chip ports. In addition, the impact of bus parasitic inductance and chip capacitances on port impedance is obtained. Compared with the experimental result, the error of dominant frequency obtained by the proposed model is less than 3%. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the spatial near-field spectrum to bus voltage and load current is studied based on experimental results. Finally, the suppression methods for forced oscillations are proposed based on the aforementioned theoretical analysis from the perspectives of both chips and packaging. The effectiveness of proposed methods is verified through experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Novel Single-Stage and Two-Stage Integrated Magnetic Chokes for DC-Side EMI Filter in Motor Drive Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269647</link><description>Passive electromagnetic interference (EMI) filters are widely used to suppress the conducted common-mode (CM) and differential-mode (DM) noise emissions. However, these passive EMI filters occupy a large PCB area and volume, reducing the power density of the converters. This article proposes two novel integrated magnetic chokes for single-stage and two-stage EMI filters. Magnetic equivalent circuits for both the proposed integrated EMI chokes have been presented to estimate the inductance and magnetic flux density of the chokes. The flux distribution in the proposed integrated chokes for the DM and CM current excitation is validated through ANSYS simulation results. The performance of the proposed integrated chokes is experimentally presented and validated on a three-phase SiC inverter-fed Brushless DC (BLDC) motor drive. The proposed integrated choke for the single-stage EMI filter and the two-stage EMI filter reduces the PCB area by 37% and 36%, respectively, and the filter box volume is reduced by 34% and 9%, respectively, when compared to their equivalent conventional EMI filters. The abovementioned reduction has been achieved without significantly increasing the weight of the filter as compared to the weight of conventional EMI filters.</description></item><item><title>Nonisolated High Step-Up DC&#8211;DC Converters: Comparative Review and Metrics Applicability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10091160</link><description>Due to the extensive role of nonisolated high step-up dc&#8211;dc converters (NHSDC)s in industrial applications and academic research works, many of these pulsewidth modulation converters have been presented in recent years. For each of these NHSDCs, some claims are introduced to verify its capabilities and features, which have been investigated in some review papers with different frameworks. Dissimilar to previous review papers, which have focused on the classification and derivation of voltage boosting techniques, this article aims to evaluate the converters from various topological and operational points of view and determine the superiority of each technique and converter according to applications. Some of these metrics are voltage gain, stresses, ripple, cost, power density, weight, size, control complexity, and components count, which lead to a comprehensive comparative study. Then, as the main purpose of this article, the effectiveness of these metrics is assessed to show how well they can lead us to fair comparison results. Moreover, some new figures of merit are proposed in this article to provide a helpful guideline in power electronic converters comparison studies.

While space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM) offers better utilization of the dc-link voltage, it is seldom employed in CHB designs due to the substantial computational burden associated with an increasing number of voltage levels in the converter. This article introduces a novel hybrid SVPWM approach in a multilevel CHB for battery energy storage systems. In this proposed system, the reference vector is decomposed into a low-frequency vector and a high-frequency vector. The low-frequency vector is generated by the low-frequency modules operating at the line frequency, while the high-frequency vector is produced by the high-frequency module working in the pulsewidth modulation mode. It compensates for the disparity between the low-frequency vector and the reference vector. To determine the low-frequency vector, an algorithm based on coordinate transformation is introduced. This significantly reduces the computational complexity, making it independent of the output voltage levels. The switching losses decrease as most power devices operate at the fundamental frequency. An experimental platform of the CHB is constructed to validate the advantages of the proposed modulation algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Model Predictive Control of a Modular Multilevel Converter Considering Control Input Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10261288</link><description>Model predictive control (MPC) usually suffers from high computational complexity when it comes to modular multilevel converters (MMCs). Some researchers have attempted to use a modulated approach to reduce the computational burden and improve the control performance. But these methods do not consider the actual physical limitations of the control system, and therefore the control performance degrades at high modulation indices or transients. To solve this problem, a modulated MPC with bound-constrained quadratic programming has been proposed. With this method, the optimal solution of the control problem can be obtained, ensuring a better control performance under high modulation index conditions or in transients. Finally, a comparative experiment with the conventional modulated MPC methods has been carried out. The experimental results validate that the proposed method can achieve superior performance when the MMC operates at high modulation index, transients, and low frequencies.</description></item><item><title>Electromagnetic Integration of Decoupled LCL-Filter for Grid-Tied Converters With FMLF Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266771</link><description>LCL-type filters, compared to L- or LC-type filters, are preferred in grid-tied converters due to their better capability of harmonic suppression. Although LCL-filters have the potential to reduce the total size and weight of the converter, but dispersion of the system is raised owing to the more discrete components, which is adverse to the compact design of the converter. To address this issue, in this work, an electromagnetic integration method of LCL-filter is proposed using flexible multilayer foil (FMLF) technique. Based on the investigation of a common FMLF-winding, the terminal-configuration to realize the two-port circuit of an LC-integration-unit is got. Following this, an electromagnetic integration unit that composed of an EE-type core and two FMLF-windings is derived for LCL filter. In this design, the FMLF-windings are wound on the side-legs of EE-core with appropriate terminal-configurations. Each winding is equivalent to an LC-unit, and the LCL filtering circuit is achieved through the cascade connection of the two windings. Moreover, by setting air-gaps in both side-legs, magnetic coupling between the two windings can be degraded for mitigating its negative influence on filtering performance. According to the modeling and theoretical analysis, prototypes of the proposed, discrete, and magnetically integrated LCL filters have been built for a 500-W SiC-MOSFET inverter, contrastive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Feedforward Frequency Deviation Control in PLL for Fast Inertial Response of DFIG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10262373</link><description>Inertial response is gradually becoming a mandatory requirement for wind turbine (WT) integrated into power system. However, most inertia control strategies are implemented in the main control system of WT or the power loop of converter control system, resulting in a slow inertial response. To cope with it, this article proposes a feedforward frequency deviation control (FFDC) for doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) based WT to achieve fast inertial response. First, the inertia model of DFIG-based WT is developed, and the effects of different control loops on the inertia characteristics are analyzed. Then, the FFDC method is proposed by introducing the frequency deviation feedforward into the phase-locked loop (PLL). Meanwhile, the inertia characteristics and stability of proposed FFDC method are studied. The results indicate that the proposed FFDC method achieves superior inertial response than the method with reduced PLL bandwidth, while not degrading PLL dynamic performance under normal conditions. Finally, the proposed method is validated by experiments.</description></item><item><title>OC Switch Fault Diagnosis, Pre- and Postfault DC Voltage Balancing Control for a CHBMC Using SVM Concept</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10262371</link><description>The voltage imbalance and the open-circuit (OC) switch fault present significant issues for a single-phase cascaded H-bridge multilevel converter, leading to negative effects such as unbalanced dc voltages, overshoot current, and high current harmonics. To address these challenges, this article presents a novel technique for OC switch fault diagnosis and dc voltage balancing control using the space vector modulation (SVM) concept. Initially, this article provides an analysis of the SVM technique, which efficiently controls the dwelling time of the vector to generate driving signals. Leveraging the advantages of SVM, a voltage residual is employed as a detection variable. Subsequently, an active vector transition scheme is devised to identify the OC switch in a power cell-by-power cell manner. Furthermore, a prefault selection principle for redundant vectors is implemented to achieve power cell voltage balancing, considering voltage differences, and ensuring smooth voltage level transitions to minimize switching losses and voltage stress. In addition, by optimizing the vector arrangement based on the reduced vector range in the postfault condition, the proposed technique optimizes current harmonics and maximizes voltage output capability while maintaining smooth switching transitions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed technique is verified through the simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Bidirectional Onboard Chargers for Electric Vehicles: State-of-the-Art and Future Trends</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10265141</link><description>Electric vehicles (EVs) are vital in the transition toward a sustainable and carbon-neutral future.

The proposed converter is composed of a conventional LLC resonant converter and a HB converter. The LLC resonant converter and the HB converter are connected in parallel on the primary side with an auxiliary winding of the LLC transformer inserted in the primary power loop of the HB converter, while the secondary windings of two converters transformers are inversely connected and share a voltage-doubler rectifier. The LLC and HB operate with the same fixed frequency, and the phase-shift modulation control between two converters is utilized to regulate the output voltage. Zero-voltage switching of all the primary switches and zero-current switching of all second side diodes can be achieved over a wide range of output voltage and load conditions. Detailed principle and voltage gain analysis based on time-domain method has been presented. After that, a simple approximate analysis method is proposed so that the voltage gain can be obtained more easily and main parameters of the converter can be fast optimally designed. Finally, a 1 KW laboratory prototype with 400 V input/50 V&#8211;450 V output has been built up to verify the theoretical analysis of the proposed converter. The peak efficiency achieves 97.9%, and features good voltage regulation capability.

However, in the relevant literature, arm voltage references are mostly normalized by the submodule (SM) capacitor voltage reference, leading to the so-called direct modulation, while the indirect modulation considering the capacitor voltage ripples receives much less attention. This article investigates the indirect modulation of MMCs, focusing on a specific PWM method where only two SMs per phase operate in PWM mode in each control period. It is found that the direct PWM (DiPWM) generates phase voltages/currents that contain high-amplitude low-order harmonics, while the indirect PWM (IndiPWM) presents well-suppressed low-order harmonics but significant distortions around the carrier frequency. The cause of the above problem of the IndiPWM is revealed theoretically through Fourier analysis, and a solution with simple implementation is developed by rearranging the switching pulses of the PWM-mode SMs. Both simulations and experiments are carried out. The results show that the proposed method combines the advantages of both DiPWM and IndiPWM, achieving low harmonic distortions simultaneously in the low frequency and around the carrier frequency.</description></item><item><title>A Modulation Strategy to Operate Five-Level HC Inverter at Wide Power Factors With Enhanced Neutral Point Voltage Balancing Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273445</link><description>Clamped multilevel inverters suffer significantly from neutral point (NP) voltage unbalancing in low power factor applications, which will lead to severe device overvoltage problems and affect its output performance. The five-level hybrid clamped (HC) inverter is a state-of-the-art topology with additional redundant switching states, which makes it possible to suppress the NP low-frequency voltage ripples better. Therefore, a novel and simple modulation for five-level HC inverter with enhanced NP voltage balancing capability is proposed. Based on the influence of NP currents on the dc-link capacitor voltages, the different switching states combinations with capacitor voltages naturally balancing constraints are analyzed comprehensively, and the relationship between the duty ratio of average NP currents and the reference modulation voltage is designed as a bi-triangular function to minimize the currents flowing out of the NPs. Compared with traditional modulation, the equivalent adjustment ability of NP currents is greatly enhanced by the zero-sequence voltage injection, and the low-frequency voltage ripples of DC-link capacitors are suppressed significantly at whole power factors. Moreover, the active balancing methods are explored to achieve independent and decoupling control of all capacitor voltages. Simulations and experiments verify the viability of the modulation strategy and the capacitor voltage balancing method.</description></item><item><title>Real Time Selective Harmonic Control&#8212;PWM Based on Artificial Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273431</link><description>Selective harmonic elimination-pulse width modulation (SHE-PWM) is a widely used low switching frequency modulation technique for medium-voltage high-power converters. This approach is able to adjust the converter fundamental component while eliminating low-order harmonics. However, some applications such as active power filters (APFs) require regulating simultaneously, both the fundamental and low-order harmonics in amplitude and phase. This article presents a novel selective harmonic control-PWM (SHC-PWM) modulator, valid for APFs, based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and sequential quadratic programming (SQP). A new offline search methodology, based on a hybrid metaheuristic-numerical algorithm, is defined to calculate the solution space when both the fundamental and a low-order harmonic are controlled in phase and amplitude. The solutions obtained are used to train the ANNs offline. Afterwards, the ANN + SQP calculation method is used to solve the SHC-PWM problem in real-time (RT). Experimental results are provided for a three-level converter to verify the effectiveness of the proposed RT control method.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Circulant Modulation for Submodule Voltage Ripple Minimization With Inherent Balancing Capability in Modular Multilevel DC&#8211;DC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10274873</link><description>The modularity of the modular multilevel dc-dc converters (MMDCs) makes them a competitive candidate in medium voltage applications but brings the submodule (SM) voltage balancing issue. This article proposes an optimal circulant modulation method for minimizing the SM voltage ripples with inherent balancing capability proven at the same time, which allows smaller SM capacitors and avoids the high-frequency communication for SM voltage balancing. First, the optimal switching pattern is strictly derived providing a general method to theoretically minimize the SM capacitor voltage ripple. Then the switching matrix of the optimal circulant modulation is formulated by introducing the generalized-circulant matrix.

The IGBT bridge processes the bulk of the power, while switching at a low frequency to maximize efficiency, while the SiC mosfets bridge's lower relative switching loss is exploited to filter low-order harmonics from the IGBT bridge. A finite-set model predictive controller is detailed that allows IGBT switching frequencies down to 1 kHz to be achieved while also tightly controlling the magnitude of current in the SiC bridge. A genetic algorithm is utilized to automatically tune the control and investigate the design of the output filter as well as the influence of the controller time-step and horizon length on the performance. Power loss estimates of a 1.5 MW application case are made showing potential for significant power-loss reductions. Experimental tests validate an field-programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of the controller and topologies performance, with IGBT bridge frequencies below 1.2 kHz and grid-current total harmonic distortion below 3% achieved. The ability of converter to switch operation between a high-current and a low-current mode and dynamic performance is also verified.</description></item><item><title>A Counter-Based Open-Circuit Switch Fault Diagnostic Method for a Single-Phase Cascaded H-Bridge Multilevel Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286161</link><description>A cascaded H-bridge multilevel converter (CHBMC), which is composed of power cells, is an attractive ac&#8211;dc converter for medium- and high-voltage applications in terms of its modularity, improved harmonic performance, and higher rated voltage withstand capability. Nevertheless, the overall operation and stability of the CHBMC can be affected by inevitable issues, such as the open-circuit (OC) switch fault. This issue causes adverse effects. Hence, it is vital to develop an effective but straightforward method to identify the OC switches. This article proposes an OC switch fault diagnostic method, which is based on counters. These counters are defined to have a one-to-one correspondence with the CHBMC switches. First, a fault feature variable is obtained based on a current residual generated from the estimated current model and the OC switch fault output voltage conditions. Subsequently, based on a postfault logic judgment process, the output voltage levels, the driving signal combinations, and the current polarity, the counters indicate the OC switch fault and its position. The proposed method is simple and voltage level-independent, making it ideal for diagnosing multiple OC switch faults for the CHBMC in a power cell and different cells. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>An Expandable Interline DC Power Flow Controller</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286857</link><description>The power flow control capability of high-voltage dc power grid can be improved by integrating a dc power flow controller into the grid.

Dual-parallel three-level inverters are widely used in several applications, such as in photovoltaic systems, wind power generation, and motor drive systems to increase the power capacity. The current ripple of each inverter appears greater on the load side due to the parallel operation of inverters. Thus, asynchronous modulation methods, such as interleaved or integrated modulation, have been proposed to improve the output current quality of three-level inverters. These asynchronous modulations generate a significant leakage current due to limited common-mode voltage (CMV) reduction. In this article, the proposed five-level reduced leakage current space vector modulation (RLC SVM) strategy adopts a switching sequence that lowers the CMV frequency. The proposed modulation solves problems such as insulation breakdown and electromagnetic interference by significantly suppressing the leakage current of the existing integrated modulation. Thus, the five-level RLC SVM method reduces the CMV, ZSCC, and output current distortion, as well as the leakage current. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed modulation method are verified based on simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>New Hybrid Thyristor-Based Multilevel Converter With DC Fault Blocking Capability, for HVDC Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10298816</link><description>High voltage direct current systems are the most suitable solution for distant high-power transmission, where modular multilevel converters (MMCs) are now utilized due to their controllability, modularity, redundancy, and scalability. Dc fault blocking capability in MMCs is normally achieved by using full-bridge submodules (FB-SMs) in the arms. However, using FB-SMs results in a high semiconductor count, which increases power losses and the overall cost. In this article, a new hybrid thyristor-based multilevel converter (HTMC) with dc fault blocking capability is proposed that uses a low number of FB-SMs with a majority of half-bridge submodules and antiparallel thyristor valves. The theory of operation is detailed including the function of each element and thyristor valve commutation. Full parameter analysis is provided for the proposed converter. The claims of the article are verified using a MATLAB Simulink model and an experimental test rig. Additionally, a detailed comparison with other viable converters is provided, which establishes that the proposed HTMC converter offers a low number of IGBTs, and lower cost and losses, with dc fault-blocking capability.</description></item><item><title>Fast-Processing Capacitor Voltage Balancing Algorithm for Single-End Five-Level NPC Converters Based on Redundant Level Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10304083</link><description>Five-level neutral point clamped (5L-NPC) topologies have been proposed for the medium-voltage grid and drive applications since the 1990s. However, their practical implementation has been hindered due to the inherent capacitor voltage drift issue, especially in a single-end configuration. This work proposes a fast-processing, carrier-based voltage balancing algorithm to address this issue, which is based on the latest redundant level modulation (RLM) concept. The proposed approach is fully based on closed-form expressions and basic logic operations, which can be straightforwardly programmed in microcontrollers, as enabled by a fully transparent mathematical model. In contrast, the existing methods treat it as a black box problem, which requires mandatory PI/PID controllers that complicate the implementation. This method shows effective and superior voltage balancing performance against existing methods without affecting the converter output capacity throughout all operating conditions. The fundamental principles and analysis of the capacitor operation are presented to enable a better understanding of the problem and its solution. This work also evaluates the increased switching actions as a side effect of the RLM operation, which is the mandatory cost for all known modulation-based voltage balancing approaches for 5L-NPC converters. For comparison across different systems, a new normalization term is proposed to quantify the capacitor voltage ripples for evaluation with the switching frequency factored in.</description></item><item><title>A Monolithic GaN DC&#8211;DC Buck Converter With an Antibootstrap Level Shifter for Envelope-Tracking Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243642</link><description>DC&#8211;DC buck converters have become a key module for improving the overall efficiency of modern communication systems. This article reports a novel monolithic GaN dc&#8211;dc buck converter with an integrated power stage and driver for envelope-tracking applications. An antibootstrap level shifter with a power consumption of nearly zero is proposed for the first time to effectively reduce the driver power consumption and improve the total efficiency of the buck converter by at least 12%.

The measured peak-power-stage efficiency and total efficiency of the fully integrated buck converter are over 92% and 84%, respectively, with an output power over 6&#8201;W at 100&#8201;MHz switching frequency. Moreover, the proposed GaN converter was tested as an envelope-tracking amplifier and achieved a total efficiency of 72.2% and normalized root-mean-square error of 2.7% for a 256QAM signal with a 20&#8201;MHz bandwidth envelope.</description></item><item><title>Spread Spectrum Modulation to Reduce EM Noise for LLC Resonant Converter Using Partial Power Processing Concept</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10254379</link><description>This article proposes a method to obtain tight output voltage regulation under the spread spectrum modulation (SSM) using a partial power processing (PPP) concept. The LLC resonant converter performs the SSM by handling most of the power as a dc transformer without output voltage regulation. In contrast, a buck converter processes only partial power to regulate the output voltage and to compensate for the output voltage fluctuations caused by the SSM. Since the output voltage fluctuation can be compensated by the PPP, high power conversion efficiency, electromagnetic (EM) noise reduction, and tight output voltage regulation can be obtained simultaneously. Furthermore, the proposed method has high cost-effectiveness compared with the conventional methods which process the full power to compensate for the output voltage fluctuation due to the SSM. The effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally verified with a 500-W prototype. The output voltage is tightly regulated under the steady-state operations and transient-state within 1.24 Vpp (2.5%) and within 1.7 Vpp (3.5%) under the rated power. The EM noises are reduced by 26 dB&#956;V (more than 45%) compared with the no SSM case. The maximum power conversion efficiency is 95.49% under the nominal input voltage of 400 V.</description></item><item><title>Gradient Descent for Fast Perturbation and Observation in Low-Power Energy Harvesting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10255279</link><description>Energy harvesters can be used to power IoT sensors. Maximum power tracking of energy harvesters allows more energy to be extracted to meet higher power requirements. However, both the open-circuit voltage method and the perturbation and observation method, which were commonly adopted for energy harvesters with ac output, have disadvantages. The former method cannot achieve conjugate impedance matching, and the latter method is slow and inefficient. Therefore, it is quite challenging to achieve conjugate impedance matching with high speed, high matching efficiency, and low power consumption for milliwatt applications. In this article, a fast perturbation and observation method based on gradient descent is proposed, which optimizes the perturbation directions and perturbation steps to find the maximum power point quickly and with low perturbation oscillation. Low-power implementation using intermittent analog&#8211;digital hybrid control is also designed. The proposed approach can find the optimal impedance within 4 s and the power matching efficiency is 97.71%, measured at resonant frequency. Compared to resistive matching, the proposed method can increase the output power of the selected electromagnetic vibration energy harvester by up to 41.2% when deviating from the resonant frequency. The overall efficiency is 90.08% at an output voltage of 2.3 V and 73.80% at an output voltage of 5.3 V.</description></item><item><title>A 1-A 90% Peak Efficiency 5&#8211;36&#8201;V Input Voltage Time-Based Buck Converter With Adaptive Gain Compensation and Controlled-Skip Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266761</link><description>Compared with analog and digital controls, time-based control makes it possible to reduce both area occupation and power consumption, especially in converters operating at high switching frequencies. In this article, we present a time-based buck converter with a wide input voltage range for general-purpose applications. A controlled-skip operation is embedded in the proportional&#8211;integral&#8211;derivative controller to increase the light-load efficiency. To avoid large variations of the open-loop crossover frequency caused by the input voltage ranging from 5 to 36&#8201;V, an adaptive compensation of the controller gain is adopted based on a novel design methodology. These solutions are verified with a prototype buck converter implemented in a 0.18-$\mu$m bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) process, which provides an output voltage of 3.3&#8201;V and a load current capability of 1&#8201;A. The measured converter peak efficiency is 90%. The efficiency is increased from 48% to 70% at 10-mA load current and 5&#8201;V input voltage, when the converter operates in a controlled-skip mode. The seamless transition between the two operation regimes is guaranteed by a finite-state machine logic, without requiring a dedicated circuit. The crossover frequency varies only by a factor of 1.8 over the input voltage range and a line regulation of 0.33 $\text {mV}/\text {V}$ is obtained.</description></item><item><title>Electric Vehicle On-Board Fast Charging Through Converter Maximum Switch Utilization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269741</link><description>This work deals with a single-phase on-board fast charger for electric vehicles (EVs). One of the key parameters to restrict the on-board fast charging is the converter power density. Almost all the existing single-stage and two-stage converter topologies in discontinuous conduction mode are limited to slow charging due to high current stress. Further, these converters, regardless of conduction modes, experience high voltage stress across semiconductor switches due to the interaction between filter and circuit inductances that limit their EV charging rate. To overcome these challenges, in this article, a new concept of utilizing the converter semiconductor switch capacity to facilitate fast charging is proposed. It is demonstrated that by using the converter switch rating at its maximum capacity, the range of power drawn from the input can be extended. To achieve the aforementioned objective, a two-stage configuration based on bridgeless switched inductor (BLSI) Cuk converter is proposed to achieve EV fast charging. The performance of the proposed concept is validated through MATLAB/ Simulink-based simulation study and proof-of-concept with a scaled-down laboratory prototype. It is shown that the proposed concept along with the BLSI Cuk converter can charge EV battery upto three times faster than conventional buck&#8211;boost converter-based single-stage and two-stage chargers.</description></item><item><title>A Bidirectional Three-Level Converter Control With Shared Control Circuit and Single-Point Sensing for Flying Capacitor Balance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10271723</link><description>This article presents a novel three-level (TL) converter control integrated circuit (IC) with a flying capacitor control loop, an adaptive constant on-time (ACOT) control, and a shared control circuit in bidirectional operation for the battery charger system. To solve the flying capacitor balance issue in TL converters, the flying capacitor control with single-point sensing (SPS) of switching voltage VX is proposed to balance the flying capacitor without a complex control and sensing circuit in an IC implementation. The proposed SPS also minimizes the inductor ripple. Besides, both directions (buck mode or boost mode) share the same control circuits except for the compensator to minimize the controller die area. The proposed scheme is realized with a 1.5 MHz switching frequency bidirectional TL converter IC in the TSMC 0.18 &#956;m complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process. The measurement result verifies that the functions are feasible in both directions, and there are no flying capacitor voltage runaway and mismatch issues. The proposed ACOT design achieves less than 6% switching frequency variation over the load range in boost mode, which is much smaller than conventional ACOT control. The proposed TL buck converter achieves an efficiency of 95.89% at 1-A load. The efficiency of the proposed TL boost converter is up to 96.02% at 0.5-A load.</description></item><item><title>From Components to Converters: A Fundamental Topology Derivation Method for Nonresonant DC&#8211;DC Converters Based on Graph Theory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278481</link><description>The past 20 years witnessed the invention of numerous converters by utilizing various topology derivation methods. Unfortunately, most of these methods are limited by pre-existing topologies or specific cells, causing the omission of some potentially valuable topologies. To break the limitations, a fundamental topology derivation method, namely components to converters (C2C), is proposed for nonresonant dc&#8211;dc converters. The basic idea of C2C is intuitively to derive topologies by combining separate components and filtering out valid combinations. Theoretically, C2C can derive converters more comprehensively since its results are not restricted by firm connections of the existing topologies or cells. However, C2C faces a heavy computing load caused by the massive combinations of components. Hence, a two-stage C2C topology derivation strategy is designed to alleviate the computing load. Furthermore, graph theory and dynamic programming are applied to computerize and optimize the above two-stage C2C. The two-stage C2C is utilized to derive single-switch two-port converters and single-inductor multiple-port converters. The derivation results show that all existing topologies with given components and numerous new topologies are derived automatically and simultaneously. Compared with the existing topology derivation methods, the proposed two-stage C2C is more thorough and automatic, facilitating more converters to meet various demands in practical applications.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Series Capacitor Isolated DC&#8211;DC Converter With Reduced Voltage Stress of Primary Switches, Full-Range ZVS Operation, and Improved Light-Load Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285019</link><description>To target the 80 Plus 380 Vdc Titanium specifications, this article proposed a novel fixed-frequency isolated dc&#8211;dc converter with full-range zero voltage switching (ZVS). Different from the conventional phase-shift full-bridge (PSFB) converter, the series capacitor structure and series-connected two transformers are incorporated in the proposed converter to achieve full-range ZVS operation and light-load efficiency improvement. First, the voltage stress of three primary switches is reduced to half of the input voltage because of the special series capacitor structure. Correspondingly, the energy needed for obtaining the ZVS operation of all primary-side switches is reduced by one-fourth of conventional methods. Furthermore, the employed series-connected two transformers not only achieve the full-range ZVS operation but also eliminate an output inductor presented in conventional PSFB converters. Therefore, higher efficiency can be achieved. In conclusion, low voltage stress, full-range ZVS operation, and fixed switching frequency are the main advantages of the proposed converter. A 360&#8211;440 V, 12 V/50 A prototype is built to verify the claimed features of the proposed converter. Experimental waveforms show the ZVS operation under the entire range. The measured efficiency is higher than 95% from 14 A load up to full load, and the peak efficiency of 96.7% can be achieved for 360 V at 25 A load.</description></item><item><title>Single-Stage Totem-Pole AC&#8211;DC Converter Based on Boost Half-Bridge Structure for Battery Chargers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10285428</link><description>In this article, a new single-stage bridgeless totem-pole ac&#8211;dc converter is proposed.

A hybrid harmonic injection in phase shift and duty cycle according to battery voltage is proposed, which not only improves total harmonic distortion to smaller than 4% under the whole load range but also extends the zero-voltage switching range of the converter under a wide voltage range.

The leakage inductance is incorporated into the resonant tank, decreasing the component count. The use of the boost capacitor connected in series with the secondary windings of the tapped inductor causes high voltage gain at the low turn ratio of the coupled inductor. By incorporating a resonant passive clamp circuit, not only the voltage spikes on the transistor are restrained, but zero-voltage switching of the transistor and zero-current turning-off of the diodes are obtained. The resonant operation results in low power losses in the switches, providing high efficiency in a wide output power range. Owing to soft-switching operation, the transistor can be driven with a high switching frequency, providing a consolidated design of the high power density converter.

A time-domain controller is utilized in the proposed converter to achieve a minimized delay time and thus ensure a high-conversion ratio (CR) with a switching frequency of 2 MHz. The proposed power converter employs a time-domain energy distribution (ED) balance scheme to ensure the bipolar outputs are symmetrically regulated. In addition, with the assistance of the output offset correction circuits, the load regulation of the TDC-SITO converter is greatly improved. By using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC)-assisted fast-settling loop, the converter achieves an excellent load transient response with low undershoot/overshoot voltages. Powered by a lithium-ion battery, the TDC-SITO converter can generate a bipolar power supply of $\pm$12 V and a standard 5 V output voltage, indicating a maximum CR of 8.8&#215;. Implemented in a 180 nm bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) process, the converter achieves a peak conversion efficiency of 91.6% at an output power of 2.25 W. With a load current step of 100 mA between two output voltages of $\pm$10 V, the output voltages recover their normal values within 100 $\mu$s while the undershoot/overshoot voltages are below 160 mV.

The proposal consists of changing the control objective of the SV: instead of controlling the injected active and reactive powers, the injected active and reactive currents are controlled (as in a grid following inverter). The resulting system [called here current controlled SV, (CCSV)], injects balanced currents, even against asymmetric faults. The CCSV is capable of operating both in island mode and in grid connected mode, and can switch between these modes without prior synchronization. Like the SV, the CCSV does not use a dedicated algorithm for synchronization (such as a phase-locked loop).</description></item><item><title>Extremely Low Frequency PS-PWM Based Technique for Cascaded H-Bridge Converters With Grid Voltage Compensation Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124860</link><description>Cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converters are good candidates for many industrial applications. Among the modulation techniques that can be applied to CHB converters, the phase-shifted pulse width modulation (PWM) method (PS-PWM) provides very good harmonic quality being the most popular modulation technique at the expense of presenting high switching losses. On the contrary block switching technique as well as selective harmonic elimination/mitigation techniques provides lower switching frequency and losses with a lower harmonic quality. Additionally, with these techniques the converter operation becomes stiff. In this work a modification of PS-PWM based on an extremely low frequency carrier is proposed with the objective of achieving both low switching losses and an acceptable harmonic quality, simultaneously. The main advantage of the proposed solution is the capability of adjusting the phase-shift angle among the carriers to compensate for harmonic grid voltage disturbance. Several experimental results have been reported to demonstrate the good performance of the proposed modulation technique.</description></item><item><title>An Islanding Detection Method Based on the Reactive Power Disturbance for Multiple Inverter-Based DG Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124816</link><description>In this article, an islanding detection method for multiple inverter-based distributed generation systems is proposed, which is based on perturbing reactive power output. An asymmetric form of positive and negative reactive power disturbance (RPD) is presented so that there always exists a certain total amount of disturbance in the system. To decrease the disturbance amplitude without expanding the nondetection zone (NDZ), a positive feedback of frequency difference is added to the disturbance. A RPD synchronization method without communication among inverters is proposed so that the averaging effect caused by unsynchronized reactive disturbances can be eliminated and the island can be detected in a multiple distributed generator (DG) system. In addition, the islanding detection criterion is improved by establishing the relationship between the direction of disturbance and the numerical symbol of frequency difference, so there is no misjudgment of islanding detection in a weak grid. Finally, an experimental platform consisting of three 6kW three-phase grid-connected inverters and a 99.9 kVA islanding detection test device is established. The experimental and simulation results indicate that the proposed method performs fast and precise islanding detection for the multiple-DG system with small NDZ and little impact on power quality. Additionally, no misjudgment happens in a weak grid.</description></item><item><title>Novel Coordinated Control Strategy for Step-Up/Down Current-Source Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124852</link><description>Current-source converter (CSC) is more attractive and increasingly used to occasions with higher requirements for reliability due to inherent antishort-circuit ability. In this article, we combine the CSC with dc/dc converter to adapt to lower input voltage applications. However, rational allocation of the duty cycle for each switch to achieve the target voltage output and the increase of the overall switching times brought by dc/dc converter are the major problems. The proposed coordinated control strategy can reasonably take full advantage of degrees of freedom based on the adjustment variable to achieve accurately control of grid-side current and load voltage. In addition, the dc-link current pulses according to six times grid angular frequency, which avoids using the zero vector to reduce the switching times.

In reality, however, the model mismatch is inevitable, which causes the inherent challenges of parameter sensitivity and model uncertainties of the FCS-MPC method. This article proposes a dynamic-linearization-based predictive control architecture to circumvent such model dependence while keeping the attractive features of the conventional FCS-MPC method. By integrating the data-driven feature of the dynamic-linearization approach, the detailed model used in the FCS-MPC controller is replaced by a virtual equivalent data model, creating a data-driven predictive control architecture. The suggested method selects optimal control action solely based on the input&#8211;output data, exhibiting strong rejection against parameter variations while inheriting the distinctive property of the conventional FCS-MPC method. Finally, the proposed design is validated through comparative simulation and experimental results on a three-level neutral-point-clamped inverter.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Hardware Emulation of Microgrid Forming Wireless Power Transfer Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122879</link><description>The prevalence of wireless charging approaches has manifested a grid-supporting potential which can be evaluated by hardware-based methodologies. In this work, real-time emulation of a bidirectional wireless power transfer (WPT) system capable of dc microgrid formation is investigated on the field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Following a detailed analysis of the transfer characteristics of the dual-active bridge with a series-compensated resonant tank in between, a unified control scheme utilizing a phase-shift strategy is proposed for a flexible voltage or current regulation, thereby enabling the dc microgrid-forming capability. Electromagnetic transient modeling is then carried out so that an accurate digital emulation platform is feasible for prototyping. The fact that the WPT has a high frequency compels a small computation step size, which poses a dramatic challenge to real-time execution. A partition&#8211;iteration approach is therefore proposed for matrix dimension reduction which ultimately results in an alleviated processing burden. In the meantime, the parallelism of configurable logic blocks and the pipelined architecture of the FPGA are explored to achieve a low hardware latency. The analytical models, as well as the proposed control method, are validated experimentally, and then real-time hardware emulation of a dc microgrid consisting of WPT systems is performed for an integration study.</description></item><item><title>A Multimode Power Processor With Wired and Wireless Battery Charging for Electric Vehicle</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130788</link><description>The propulsion unit is the prime power module in an electric vehicle (EV) that keeps it moving. This module includes a propulsion motor and a power electronic interface that converts dc to three phase ac for driving the motor. In addition to this, separate power electronic modules are used for on-board wired charging and wireless charging. This article proposes a multimode power processor for EV capable of serving the purpose of three different power modules required for propulsion, wired charging, and wireless charging. This optimizes the weight, volume, and cost of the EV as separate power modules are avoided for three different modes. This article also proposes a new scheme for the transmitting side power electronic module that taps power from the single-phase utility grid and generates high frequency ac using a resonant inverter for wireless power transfer. In both the wired and wireless charging method, the proposed technique draws power from the single-phase wall outlet, charges the EV battery pack with constant current-constant voltage charging logic and performs power factor correction operation at the input ac grid side. A laboratory scale prototype is developed for experimentally validating the proposed concept with a 24 V, 30 Ah battery set and a 24 V, 400 W BLdc motor.</description></item><item><title>AC Loss Analytic Method and Optimization of Litz Winding for High-Speed Electrical Machines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10132408</link><description>The high speed of the machine brings advantages, such as the improvement of the power density, but also has a significant effect on the ac loss of the winding. Compared to the commonly used round and flat wire, litz wire shows great performance on reducing the ac loss. However, the circulating current between the strands in litz wire cannot be ignored at high speed. Thus, it is necessary to study the circulating current loss of litz winding. This article proposed an analytical model to calculate the circulating current loss in litz winding, which takes the twisted process into consideration. First, the circulating current loss can be calculated based on the voltage and inductance obtained by sampling interpolation method. The calculation model takes the effect of the circulating current on the magnetic field in reverse into consideration. Second, taking doubly salient brushless dc (DSBLDC) generator as an example, the influence factors of litz winding structure parameters on circulating current loss are analyzed, which provides a basis for the design of machine winding. Finally, an experiment platform aiming to measure the circulating current loss is designed, proving the accuracy of the analytical model. And a 12/8 high-speed DSBLDC generator prototype with litz winding is designed for experimental verification.</description></item><item><title>A Sinusoidal Doubly Salient Electromagnetic Machine Drive Fed by Third-Harmonic Injection Two-Stage Matrix Converter With Integrated Injection Inductor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124867</link><description>This article studies a sinusoidal doubly salient electromagnetic machine (SDSEM) drive fed by third-harmonic injection two-stage matrix converter (3TSMC) with integrated injection inductor to improve the power density of the whole system. First, compared with the conventional matrix converter, the 3TSMC suffers from larger volume due to the inductor in the harmonic current injection circuit. In the proposed system, the harmonic injection current is synthesized by the field current of SDSEM and the injection inductor is removed. Then, the control strategy is proposed to decouple the current injection control and field current control, which means that the harmonic current and the field current can be regulated flexibly. Finally, a prototype is built to evaluate the proposed system and control strategy. Furthermore, the proposed 3TSMC-fed drive with the corresponding control strategy is also suitable for the other dc-excited three-phase sinusoidal ac machines, such as wound rotor synchronous machines.</description></item><item><title>Magnetic Field Distortion Analysis and Suppression for the Minimum Unit Winding Segmented Moving-Magnet Linear Motor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124839</link><description>Segmented power supply is frequently utilized for long-stroke moving-magnet linear synchronous motors to lessen the issue of large loss and heating brought on by long-stroke power supply. However, the driving mode of partial excitation in segmented power supply brings some problems, such as unbalanced parameters of three-phase, the transient inductance of winding changing with secondary position, and distortion of armature reaction magnetic field. This article proposes a new topology with the minimum unit winding segmented to solve the problems of unbalanced inductance parameters and distortion of armature reaction magnetic field in winding segmented permanent magnet linear synchronous motors (WS-PMLSM). An analytical model of inductance distortion in the end coils of a moving-magnet PMLSM is established and compared with the nonend coil inductance to summarize the mechanism of inductance unbalance in WS-PMLSM. Based on the model of winding transient inductance changing with secondary position, the changing law of transient inductance is expounded. An analytical method of the air gap magnetic field based on virtual winding is proposed, and the formation mechanism of magnetic field distortion caused by partial excitation is revealed. Aiming at the topology of the minimum unit winding segmented moving-magnet PMLSM, an optimized drive strategy of n+3 is proposed.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Design of Adjustable-Gap Double-Side Axial Flux Permanent Magnet Hysteresis Damper</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130742</link><description>In this article, a novel adjustable-gap double-side axial flux permanent magnet hysteresis damper (AGDSAPHD) is proposed, of which the torque can be adjusted by changing the air gap and the magnetic field angle between the upper and lower stators at the same time. To analyze and design, a modified vector Jiles&#8211;Atherton (JA) hysteresis model is used for simulating the magnetic flux distribution and the hysteresis torque of AGDSAPHD. The eddy currents in the AGDSAPHD are analyzed, which have a great influence on the output torque when the rotational speed is fast. A splitting method used in the rotor of the AGDSAPHD is proposed to reduce the effect of eddy currents. The heat distribution of the AGDSAPHD is calculated to determine its slip power and operating mode. A prototype is built and tested to verify the reliability of the analysis. The experiments prove that the modified vector JA model has high computational accuracy in calculating the hysteresis effects of the AGDSAPHD. A splitting method used in the rotor can greatly reduce the eddy current torque. AGDSAPHD has a greater torque adjustment range and better temperature stability than the traditional one.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Single-Stage AC/DC Converter Integrated Interleaved DCM Boost PFC and LLC DC&#8211;DC With Reduced Bus Voltage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124838</link><description>Due to the applied pulse frequency modulation control and switch integration, single-stage boost-LLC ac/dc converters suffer from high bus voltage, which makes them difficult to operate for high voltage input. To solve this issue, a novel single-stage ac/dc converter by incorporating the interleaved discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) boost cell and an LLC cell is proposed. Different from the existing topology, in the proposed converter, two capacitors employed for splitting the ac input voltage into two parts are placed before the rectifier bridge. Thus, the voltage across each power factor correction (PFC) cell is halved and the bus voltage can be significantly reduced. Furthermore, two high-frequency diodes and one filter capacitor are omitted, which helps improve the zero-crossing distortion of the input current. More importantly, the circuit efficiency is thus increased. Hence, low bus voltage, low component count, and high efficiency are the main advantages of the proposed converter. Simulations and experimental results are presented to prove the aforementioned features of the proposed converter.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Design of LCC Resonant Converter With Phase Shift Control for Wide Input/Output Voltage Ranges in Fuel Cell System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138756</link><description>This article proposes an optimal design of an LCC resonant converter with a phase shift control for a fuel cell system that has wide input and output voltage ranges. The proposed optimal design focuses on the circulating energy minimization by adjusting the transformer turns ratio according to the maximum gain of resonant tank. This makes the root mean square value of resonant current and turn-off current stationary even though the resonant tank change. Thus, designers can select resonant tank optimized for the converter specifications without considering the conduction and switching losses. By the proposed optimal design, the efficiency degradation at worst case, which is a significant issue of the fuel cell system with wide output voltage range, can be minimized. In addition, for the fuel cell converter with wide input voltage range, a phase shift control that operates the full-bridge inverter with a constant effective duty cycle according to the fuel cell voltage is proposed. This control scheme improves the light-load efficiency without deteriorating the rated-load efficiency by reducing the circulating current and switching frequency. The validity of the proposed works is confirmed by experimental results of the 30-kW LCC resonant converter.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Modularization Method for Voltage Equalization of Ultracapacitor Bank Using Coupled Inductor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130760</link><description>The voltage equalization of ultracapacitors (UCs) in a UC bank using coupled inductors is superior due to their advantages of simple control, fast energy transfer capabilities, etc. However, as the number of UCs connected in series or parallel in a UC bank increases, the number of windings on a single core required for balancing also increases. This causes severe mismatches between the inductance of the multiple winding in a single core, making the implementation more complex. Therefore, in this article, a novel modularization method is proposed for a matrix-connected UC bank. The proposed method achieves cell balancing, module balancing, and demagnetization with less number of components. Moreover, the proposed method uses a single pair of complementary pulsewidth modulation signals with a 50% duty ratio for all switches. The energy is transferred from the higher voltage cell to the lower voltage cell simultaneously through the coupled inductors, which increases the balancing speed. The balancing performance of the proposed modularization is validated experimentally.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Wired/Wireless Hybrid Multiport Energy Router for Dynamic EV Energy Internet With Grid-Tied and Islanded Operations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124849</link><description>Energy routers are indispensable in deploying energy Internet for electric vehicles (EVs), which flexibly handle the power flow regulation. Combined with the excellent characteristic of wireless power transfer technology for noncontact energy transmission, this article proposes a novel wired/wireless hybrid multiport energy router (HMER) for future EV energy Internet. First, multiple bidirectional power ports are provided to control the power flow among the grid, various dc power sources, and EVs. Moreover, with grid-tied and islanded operations, the proposed HMER enables dynamic wireless energy exchange for EVs on the move. When moving along the energy exchange lane, the EVs can receive power from the HMER and conduct energy feedback, relieving mileage anxiety while creating economic benefits. Furthermore, a mathematical model of the system is derived, and a control algorithm is introduced to perform decoupled power control for each transceiver. Finally, a SIC experimental prototype is constructed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed HMER system. Experimental results prove the transceivers can get bidirectional wireless energy interconnection on the energy exchange lane in both grid-tied mode and islanded mode, and each transceiver can realize independent power regulation.</description></item><item><title>An Improvised Modulation and Control Approach for Dual Active Bridge DC&#8211;DC Converter System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122858</link><description>Aimed at the control and modulation of dual active bridge bidirectional dc (DAB-BIDC) converter, an unconventional approach is applied to explore its effect in symmetrical wave-based isolated dc&#8211;dc converters. The existing control schemes of DAB-BIDC converter with unified or optimal phase shift modulation have the constraints like complex control schemes, light load efficiency, current stress, and reactive power. As 50 Hz grid-connected converter uses a sinusoidal pulse width modulation to minimize the requirement for passive filters and improves the power quality. Similarly, this work investigates the same analogy for the high-frequency (HF) symmetrical wave converters to get effective modulation and control scheme for the DAB-BIDC converter. Furthermore, the proposed sinusoidal pulsewidth-phase shift modulation scheme has been implemented by the optimally derived control parameters using Lagrange&#8217;s Multiplier Method to minimize the reactive power flow and current stress reduction at the HF link. Therefore, the DAB-BIDC converter with the proposed modulation and control approach can be used for EV charging and solid-state transformers applications. Finally, the proposed work is validated using MATLAB simulation and experimental setup having turn ratio 36/12 V, fundamental frequency 5-kHz, and switching frequency 100-kHz for the experimental validation using OPAL-RT.</description></item><item><title>A Multiwinding Coupling Model for the Forward Input-Series Transformer-Integration Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138749</link><description>The forward input-series transformer-integration (ISTI) converter is suitable for high-input voltage multiple-output applications. Active input voltage sharing (IVS) of this converter is achieved through coupling of the transformer primary windings (PWs), which can be affected by windings arrangements of the integrated-transformer. To describe coupling influences of various PWs, as well as coupling influences between each PW and the secondary windings adequately, a multiwinding coupling model of the forward integrated-transformer is proposed. Based on this model, active IVS performance of the forward ISTI converter is analyzed in detail, through which design principles of the forward integrated-transformer to improve active IVS performance are concluded. Finally, the forward integrated-transformers with four typical PWs arrangements are design for a 1 kV/96 W laboratory-made forward ISTI converter, and the analysis based on the proposed model is verified by the simulating and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Gyrator-Gain Variable WPT Topology for MC-Unconstrained CC Output Customization Using Simplified Capacitance Tuning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124869</link><description>Load-independent constant current (CC) outputs are desirable in many applications of wireless power transfer (WPT). Yet the WPT gain of a conventional system is normally dependent on the magnetic components such as coils or inductors, making it difficult to customize the output for interoperability. This article presents a gain variable WPT topology for CC output customization, which only employs capacitance tuning to provide sufficient freedom in gain regulation. To break the gain limitation of S-S compensation, which is the simplest with gyrator characteristics for CC output, a capacitive or inductive component is paralleled to the coil as SP-S or S-PS compensation. A thorough analysis based on the Y-&#916; transform indicates that the gain is restrictively variable with the parallel component. An S-CLC-compensated topology without an independent inductor is further proposed to avoid those restrictions with as few additional components as possible. The inductor in the topology, coupled with the transmitter coil and integrated into the receiver coil, extends the gain variable range. A complete design process of the topology is presented to realize efficient WPT and CC output customization with a wide variable-gain range and misalignment tolerance. Analytical and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the gyrator-gain variation by capacitance tuning. Finally, the performance of the WPT topology is evaluated by experimental results on a scaled-down prototype.</description></item><item><title>Non-Adaptive Speed and Position Estimation of Doubly-Fed Induction Generator in Grid-Connected Operations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138728</link><description>The nonadaptive speed and position estimation scheme for a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG) is presented in this article.

However, the current sensor-based monitoring methods have limitations in accurately monitoring variables at multitimescales. This article presents a real-time digital mapped (RTDM) method for the sensorless multitimescale operation condition monitoring in power electronics&#8217; systems using field-programmable gate array simulators. The mathematical models of power converters are deployed in the simulator considering multitimescale characteristics. Both the digital simulator and the physical power converter are controlled by the same control signals, allowing the simulator to map the accurate operation conditions of the power converters without additional physical sensors. The RTDM method can monitor variables on the switching period timescale to the system transient timescale due to the consideration for the ideal switch modeling of the semiconductor switch. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated using a 30 kW dual active bridge converter as an example, through the integration of an experimental prototype and a simulator to create an RTDM platform. This method offers an easy and sensorless way to monitor multitimescale variables in power electronics&#8217; systems, providing a more comprehensive and visual analysis of their operation.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Low-Cost DC Chopper for Offshore Wind VSC-HVDC System by Using Thyristors Instead of Full-Control Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130764</link><description>Voltage source converter based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) technology has a broad application prospect in high-capacity offshore wind power transmission, and it is of great importance to achieve fault ride through (FRT) of offshore wind VSC-HVDC systems. The existing dc chopper cannot meet the requirements of high performance and low cost at the same time, which limits its further promotion and application. In this article, a novel low-cost dc chopper based on thyristor-LC circuit (TLC-DCC) is proposed, which uses a low-cost semicontrol device, namely the thyristor, and generates dc current zero-crossing through the cooperation of an LC circuit to realize the reliable turn off of the energy consumption module, thus providing a new idea for solving the FRT problem. In addition, the TLC-DCC control strategy and key parameter coordination method are proposed. To verify the effectiveness of TLC-DCC, a 4 kV/2.4 MW prototype is built. On this basis, the characteristics of TLC-DCC are analyzed, and the simulation results show that TLC-DCC can realize FRT under different short-circuit conditions. Compared with the existing dc chopper, TLC-DCC has the great advantage of reducing the total cost by 38% with the same performance.</description></item><item><title>Wind-Driven Position Sensorless Switched Reluctance Generator and Diesel Generator Based Microgrid for Optimal Fuel Consumption and Power Blackout Mitigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138681</link><description>This article proposes a battery-supported wind power generation system (WPGS) with a mechanical position sensorless switched reluctance generator (SRG) and a diesel generator set (DGS) to enable uninterrupted electricity to remote locations. A sliding mode position observer estimates the SRG speed and position based on the generator voltages and currents. The proposed control approach enhances the consideration of dynamic variations in demand and generation in light of the potential for off-grid operation of small-scale WPGS in regions with a weak or nonexistent grid. Diesel engines perform best at 80%&#8211;100% of full capacity. At this mechanical loading, CO and other greenhouse gases are the lowest. The proposed approach keeps the DGS at 80%&#8211;100% loading regardless of mechanical load to maximize efficiency. In such a microgrid, the power quality (PQ) concern is dominant due to the use of local nonlinear loads. Hence, a joint logarithmic hyperbolic cosine adaptive filter is designed for the microgrid to mitigate the PQ issues emerging due to the nonlinear loads.</description></item><item><title>Active Damping for Dynamic Improvement of Multiple Grid-Tied Virtual Synchronous Generators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130744</link><description>To eliminate low-frequency oscillations, this article proposes an active-damping method for multiple grid-tied virtual synchronous generators (VSGs) in a power plant. First, using Lyapunov&#8217;s indirect method, the damping ratio of multiple VSGs in parallel is analyzed. The average damping ratio reveals that this multi-VSG power plant can be poorly damped in a wide range of inertia and damping settings. Then, self- and mutual-damping controllers are developed to suppress self- and mutually induced low-frequency power oscillations, respectively. For practical implementation, an adaptive tuning algorithm that enables automatic realization is proposed. Through a reassessment, a remarkable damping-ratio improvement is validated. Moreover, the inertial response improvement is validated by the frequency response analysis. Finally, simulations in Digsilent/PowerFactory and experiments are performed to demonstrate the accuracy of the analyses and the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Robust Consensus for Distributed Microgrid Control Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124836</link><description>Consensus-based distributed control has been proposed for coordinating distributed energy resources (DERs) in microgrids (MGs). As one key component, distributed average observers are used to estimate the average of a group of reference signals (e.g., voltage, current, or power). State-of-the-art distributed average observers could lead to loss of privacy due to information exchange on the communication channels. The DERs' reference signals, which contain private information, could be inferred by an eavesdropper. In this article, a privacy-preserving distributed average observer is proposed that is based on robust consensus and uses the state decomposition method to preserve privacy. Compared to the existing methods, the proposed observer does not require the knowledge of the reference signal's derivative and gives accurate and smooth estimation, and is thus applicable for MG distributed control applications. A detailed analysis regarding the convergence and privacy properties of the proposed observer is presented. The proposed observer is implemented on hardware controllers and validated in the context of distributed MG control applications through hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests.</description></item><item><title>Cascaded Interleaved DC&#8211;DC Converter for a Bidirectional Electric Vehicle Charging Station</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122856</link><description>The dc&#8211;dc bidirectional step-up interleaved converter coupled by a central capacitor in a cascaded topology is used as a bidirectional electric vehicle charging station for charging and discharging the battery of an electric vehicle.

However, charging inconsistency caused by inevitable manufacture and usage inconsistencies can lead to lower efficiency, capacity, and shorter durability due to the &#8220;cask effect.&#8221; This goal can be achieved by solving a series of constrained optimization problems with the model-based framework. Nevertheless, the high computational complexity, identifiability, and observability issues still limit their fidelity and robustness. To overcome these limitations and provide end-to-end learning strategies, this article proposes a balancing-aware fast-charging control framework based on deep reinforcement learning. In particular, a cell-to-pack equalization topology is first introduced to dispatch energy among in-pack cells. Then, the balancing awareness fast charging problem is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem by considering charging time, consistency, and over-voltage safety constraints. Further, a deep reinforcement learning framework using a deep Q-network is established to find the optimal policy. By using the generalization of a neural network, the learned policies can be transferred to real-time charging and balancing control, thus improving the applicability of the proposed strategy. Finally, numerous comparative simulations and experimental results illustrate its effectiveness and superiority in terms of charging rapidity and balancing.</description></item><item><title>Robust Predictive Control of Grid-Connected Converters: Sensor Noise Suppression With Parallel-Cascade Extended State Observer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138676</link><description>Model-predictive control is a constrained optimization control method with superior performance than linear methods for multivariable and multiobjective control of power converters.

PC-ESO's time-domain structure and comprehensive frequency-domain analysis are presented. Furthermore, PC-ESO is applied to improve the transient disturbance rejection of CESO through a novel structurally adaptive ESO (SAESO) algorithm. The proposed SAESO provides both high-frequency noise suppression and better disturbance rejection than CESO and cascade-parallel ESO. Finally, the proposed methods are experimentally validated by the model-free predictive control of a grid-connected power converter.</description></item><item><title>A Wearable All-Printed Textile-Based 6.78 MHz 15 W-Output Wireless Power Transfer System and Its Screen-Printed Joule Heater Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130759</link><description>While research in passive flexible circuits for wireless power transfer (WPT) such as coils and resonators continues to advance, limitations in their power handling and low efficiency have hindered the realization of efficient all-printed high-power wearable WPT receivers. Here, we propose a screen-printed textile-based 6.78 MHz resonant inductive WPT system using planar inductors with concealed metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;metal tuning capacitors. A printed voltage doubler rectifier based on silicon carbide diodes is designed and integrated with the coils, showing a power conversion efficiency of 80%&#8211;90% for 2&#8211;40 W inputs over a wide load range. Compared to prior wearable WPT receivers, it offers an order of magnitude improvement in power handling along with higher efficiency (approaching 60%) while using all-printed passives and a compact rectifier. The coils exhibit a simulated specific absorption rate under 0.4 W/kg for 25 W received power, and under 21 $^{\circ }$C increase in the coils' temperature for a 15 W DC output. Additional fabric shielding is investigated, reducing harmonics emissions by up to 17 dB.

Consequently, engineers may need to tune the controller parameters by trial and error to design the control systems that achieve desired performance. In digital control, sinusoidal references of power converters are discrete-time sequences. Based on this, we present a digital design technique for the PR controllers and demonstrate the design process using a 13.2-kW grid-connected inverter prototype. The design ensures the sinusoidal reference's tracking-error sequence converges at the desired rate. The advised design technique's merits include the following conditions: 1) the tracking-error convergence rate, phase margin, and cutoff frequency have clear mathematical relations, allowing engineers to uniquely determine the controller parameters by specifying any two indicators; 2) with the tuned controller parameters, the tracking-error sequence can converge at the desired rate; and 3) the resultant controller can be partitioned into one proportional term and two resonant terms; the first two terms are construed as a standard PR controller digitally implemented via the zero-order-hold method, whereas the second resonant term guarantees the tracking-error sequence converging in the desired manner. A case study results confirm the digital PR controller's efficacy.</description></item><item><title>An Effective PQ-Decoupling Control Scheme Using Adaptive Dynamic Programming Approach to Reducing Oscillations of Virtual Synchronous Generators for Grid Connection With Different Impedance Types</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138733</link><description>The power coupling of the virtual synchronous generator (VSG) in the grid-connected mode may aggravate power oscillation because of a resistance-inductive line. In order to deal with this issue, this research study proposes an adaptive and optimal approach to controlling VSG via reinforcement learning and adaptive dynamic programming (ADP). It derives the linear and nonlinear hybrid equations of the VSG power considering the case where the line impedance is uncertain. The nonlinear part is a disturbance, and the linear ADP solves the optimal feedback control and compensation controller, eliminating the interaction between the active power and reactive power. Also, the proposed method utilizes value iteration and is data-driven. Thus, it does not rely on an initial stability control gain and an accurate dynamic model during the learning process. Comparative experiments reveal the effectiveness of the proposed method and validate the practicability of the methodology introduced; in addition, comparative simulations present the superiority of the proposed method in power systems based on synchronous generators.</description></item><item><title>A Multiport Current-Fed IIOS Dual-Half-Bridge Converter for Distributed Photovoltaic MVDC Integration System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124858</link><description>The input-independent output-series (IIOS) dc&#8211;dc converter structure possesses the capability to achieve high voltage gain, single-stage power conversion, and multiport independent control, which is suitable for distributed photovoltaic (PV) power collection system. However, if the multiport input powers are different, the output voltage of each submodule (SM) will be uneven, which might lead to power degradation and device damage. In order to address SM output voltage imbalance problem, in this article, a voltage self-balancing output-series dual-half-bridge (OSDHB) converter based on multiwinding coupled inductor is developed. By multiplexing the SM secondary-side switches in OSDHB, the unbalanced power between SMs can be directly transmitted to the target SM, without the requisition for transmission one by one. And all power switches possess zero-voltage switching characteristic. Therefore, the proposed IIOS-DHB features high efficiency, low cost, simple control, and more adaptive to distributed PV power generation system.

An adaptive actuator driver for ac contactors is proposed based on the coil impedance estimation and mathematical equations between the coil impedance and excitation control parameters. The coil impedance estimation and its error correction are established through the voltage balance equation when the contactor is in the open position. The coil inductance estimation is established through the zero-state response equation when the contactor is in the closed position. The mathematical equations are established based on the equivalence of the electromagnetic force under different excitation methods, the power consumption model, and the control system's transfer function. A geometric feature of the flux linkage waveform is established to identify whether a contactor is in the closed position and realize the self-transition of the driver's working state. Then, self-tuning regulators for the excitation control parameters are realized. This driver has a plug-and-play function for ac contactors and can reduce the contactor's power consumption. This driver may be prospectively reduced to a chip.</description></item><item><title>A FEA-Based Fast AC Steady-State Algorithm for a Voltage-Driven PMSM by a Novel Voltage-Flux-Driven Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138731</link><description>Finite element analysis (FEA) has been used more frequently than ever before in electrical machine design covering different disciplines such as electromagnetics, rotor dynamics, thermodynamics, etc. The accuracy and speed of FEA are in high demand, especially when time-stepping FEA is employed in the electromagnetic design of the machine. In this article, to accelerate numerical transient in FEA of a voltage-driven permanent magnet synchronous machine, a fast ac steady-state algorithm has been proposed, in which the voltage supply is converted into the stator flux linkage and the machine can be regarded as driven by the flux linkage directly. The electromagnetic transient is eliminated by injecting additional voltage signals to compensate for the oscillating stator flux linkage in the transient and the time-stepping error caused by the backward Euler in FEA. And the additional voltage signals will finally disappear after the steady state is achieved within about a half electrical time period. In addition, the maximum torque per ampere control logic can also be realized by adjusting the initial phase angle of the voltage supply based on the vector diagram. The simulation speed of the proposed method in this paper was compared to other traditional models, and the accuracy was verified by experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Double Five-Phase-Four-Leg Topology Converter for Five-Axis Active Magnetic Bearing With Optimized Current Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124826</link><description>Active magnetic bearing (AMB) is a kind of contactless bearing system for high-speed rotational machines. Power electronics converter is the key conversion unit for the electromagnetic force generation. However, there is no such kind of integrated power electronics converter to drive a typical five-axis magnetic bearing by considering the global optimization of power electronics devices. In order to cut the cost and increase the power density of AMB converter, this article analyzes the development status of topology of AMB drive and proposes a novel converter with double five-phase-four-leg topology. The novel converter could control all the ten winding currents of five-axis AMB with only eight switches while the conventional topology needs twenty switches by further utilizing the freedom degree of the AMB control. Also, compared with the conventional topology, the switches of novel topology have same maximum voltage and current. Furthermore, this article proposes the optimized current control methods to minimize the bias current of the active magnetic bearing and applies it to the double five-phase-four-leg topology converter. With the optimized current control, actual current of each coil is decreased and difficulty of thermal design is reduced. The proposed double five-phase-four-leg topology can suspend the five-axis AMB by only using eight switches and eight diodes, which is the minimum compared with the state of the art.</description></item><item><title>High-Speed Controller to Enhance Responsiveness and Stability of Dynamic Characteristics for DC&#8211;DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130766</link><description>As the demand for digital systems that require dc power increases rapidly, the importance of stable dc power supply methods increases. Various elements, such as renewable energy and load, are configured in the power grid that supplies dc, and they are connected in various forms and power patterns. These elements have different starting and operating characteristics, which can be disadvantageous to the design of controllers for power converters to maintain a stable bus voltage in the dc power grid. Therefore, in a dc power system, an energy storage system with active bidirectional power control technology that can minimize transient conditions, such as overshoot, which can occur when a load is connected or power accelerates rapidly, is significantly important. This article proposes a novel power control method capable of compensating for the instability of the dc bus voltage owing to the transient state in the dc power supply system. This method minimizes overshoot and ensures fast responsiveness and system stability by calculating the flux linkage of an inductor in a bidirectional dc&#8211;dc converter and applying an excitation voltage without pulsewidth modulation switching. The performance and validity of the proposed transient high-speed controller are verified through simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Multithreaded State Controller for Grid-Connected Converter With Imposed Limits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138729</link><description>This article proposes an innovative approach to control a grid-connected converter. The method combines the versatility and high-quality control offered by the state-feedback controllers for linear plants with the ease of imposing limits on the controlled variables offered by the cascaded control systems. The method is groundbreaking in its ability to bridge the gap between the elegance of the full-state-feedback control structure and its lack of popularity among power electronics engineers and possibly also other groups of practitioners. A multithreaded state controller is proposed in the form of three state controllers: one to control grid currents and dc-link voltage if limits of the currents are not reached, and two state controllers that are put into the closed loop if one of the current limits is reached. A complete design procedure is proposed, including the selection of all gains present in the three state-feedback controllers using the pole placement method. An algorithm of soft switching between the three control signals is also developed. Sharing the desired dynamics between the threads is fulfilled thanks to the eigenstructure assignment introduced to overcome the problem of multiple solutions by choosing the most orthogonal eigenvectors. The proposed control system is then verified in a simulation, and its high practicality is demonstrated experimentally.</description></item><item><title>Impedance Circle Modeling and Dynamic Characteristics Analysis of Contactless Energy Transfer System Under Load Variations in Rotary Ultrasonic Machining</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130770</link><description>In rotary ultrasonic machining, contactless energy transfer (CET) is developed to transmit energy to the transducer at the series resonant frequency or resonant frequency of the transducer. Specifically, during energy transmission, variations in working conditions such as variable axial forces will change the load of the transducer and introduce undesired dynamic effects into the CET system (CETS). In order to explore the connections between these variations and the working performance more directly and theoretically, a new theoretical model&#8212;CETS impedance circle is proposed in this article to reflect the CETS dynamic characteristics, including the CETS frequency characteristics and the relationships between CETS transfer performances at different frequencies under load variations. With the developed theoretical model, the effect of load variations on the trends of CETS impedance circle is investigated. Moreover, based on the impedance circle and its trends, the CETS frequency characteristics, the effect of primary series compensation, and a comparison of the transfer performances at the two working frequencies are theoretically studied. Finally, the CETS impedance circle theories are experimentally verified, and the experimental results are consistent with the analysis of the theoretical model.</description></item><item><title>Current Edge-Control Strategy for Multiple Energy Routers Based on Cyber-Energy Dual Modulations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130748</link><description>Recently, energy routers have been widely applied in the dc microgrid to achieve the power balance among buses, and the relative control strategies with a communication network assumption have been proposed. However, the communication network assumption cannot be satisfied in a remote mountainous area and an island area. To this end, this article proposes one communication-free edge-control strategy for energy routers based on cyber-energy dual modulation to achieve power balance without the communication network assumption. First, the network structure and the system model are introduced, which is a fundamental pretreatment for the subsequent controller design. Second, the cyber-energy dual modulation approach without additional communication line is designed to exchange the information among distributed generations, which is an indispensable communication environment design for the subsequent controller design. Considering the system model feature and communication environment feature, the periodic dynamic event-triggered edge-control strategy is proposed in this article. Finally, the proposed strategy effectiveness of the energy router is well verified through the dc&#8211;dc converter experiment set and the OPAL-RT test system.</description></item><item><title>TBMF Framework: A Transformer-Based Multilevel Filtering Framework for PD Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124857</link><description>Partial discharge (PD) of overhead lines is an indication of imminent dielectric breakdown and a cause of insulation degradation. Efficient PD detection is the significant foundation of electrical system maintenance. This article proposes a transformer-based multilevel filtering (TBMF) framework for PD detection. It creates the multilevel filtering mechanism to be robust to large-scale industrial measurements contaminated with a variety of background noises and plenty of invalid information. The primary filtering innovatively creates the principle of possible PD measurements to replace feature extraction and reduce manual intervention. For the first time, multiple transformer-based algorithms are introduced to the PD detection field to process the possible PD measurements without relying on the sequence order. The secondary filtering then refines the segmentation-level results from the primary filtering and outputs the overall detection results. Multiple numerical algorithms, artificial intelligence models, and intelligent metaheuristic optimization have been adopted as methodologies of the secondary filtering. The TBMF framework is experimentally verified by extensive field trial data of medium-voltage overhead power lines. Its detection accuracy reaches 96.1$\%$, which outperforms other techniques in the literature. It provides an economic and complete PD detection solution to maintain the economical and safe operation of power systems.</description></item><item><title>From Pseudo to Real: Generalized Subspace Method for Power Spectrum Reconstruction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138768</link><description>Subspace methods are widely used in statistical signal processing owing to their super-resolution. Conventional subspace methods, such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC) identify parameters containing frequency and direction of arrival by calculating pseudospectra without physical amplitudes. However, the real value of amplitude plays a significant role in fault diagnosis and condition monitoring. Additionally, due to hardware limitations and increased frequency, uniform (Nyquist) sampling becomes challenging. Nonuniform sampling, an alternative to high-rate sampling is common in practice. Consequently, nonuniform (sub-Nyquist) signal processing methods are urgently required. In this article, a generalized subspace method (GSM) is proposed to bridge the pseudospectrum with the real spectrum. The proposed method is a supplement to the existing subspace methods and is applicable to both uniform and nonuniform sampling. In the GSM, the Fourier coefficient of the autocorrelation function is derived by signal subspace from the perspective of basis matching. Then, an alias-free real power spectrum is obtained by combining the power spectrum reconstructed by GSM with the classical pseudospectrum. Finally, simulation and experiment demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in power spectrum reconstruction. Even under the dual influence of undersampled and nonuniform, the proposed method is still effective.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Rotor Ground Fault Protection Based on the Convolution Integral for Synchronous Motors With Static Excitation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138730</link><description>The detection of motor failures is a very active research topic within the literature. In particular, ground faults in wound rotors of synchronous motors have a relatively high failure rate since the rotor winding is exposed concomitantly to electrical, mechanical, and thermal stress cycles. Its detection depends on the grounding type of the electrical power system, and, in its early stages, it may present significant resistance. This article provides a new rotor ground fault protection method based on the convolution integral of the neutral voltage that is measured by a single extra sensor. In addition, it is able to fill out the gaps of the current state-of-the-art, such as: provides a larger detection frontier for incipient faults; has low sensitivity for dynamic variances of the firing angle, allowing its utilization in cyclical applications; and can be implemented in power electronic controller systems with limited bandwidth. In this sense, mathematical modeling, simulations and experimental data are presented to support to the proposed method. Furthermore, it was implemented in the controller of static excitation converters for real-time protection and successfully tested with synchronous motors (2.4MW/3.3kV) of a cold rolling mill plant owned by ArcelorMittal Group.</description></item><item><title>A Method for Separation of Power Semiconductor Packaging-Related Wear-Out Mechanisms Under Converter Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122862</link><description>This article proposes a new method to separate the package-related wear-out failure mechanisms of wire-bonded silicon-based power semiconductor switches: bond-wires lift-off and solder layer degradation. The proposed method takes the on-state voltages of power semiconductor device during the start-up transient and steady state of power converters only, respectively, to realize the separation. It overcomes the challenges faced by existing separation methods that have complex offline implementation process or are applicable to the devices with specific bond-wires connection and operational characteristic. The proposed method has the features of easy-of-implementation, online implementation, and relatively general application compared to existing methods. A case study with a single-phase inverter is demonstrated to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Low-Noise Quality Factor Tuning in Nondegenerate MEMS Gyroscope Without Dedicated Tuning Electrode</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130746</link><description>Quality factor tuning is attractive in degenerate and nondegenerate (NDE) MEMS gyros for drift suppression or shock and vibration immunity. This article proposes three resistance-based Q-factor tuning approaches without dedicated electrodes for NDE gyro. The inherent sensing capacitance is utilized as a Q-tuning mechanism for low cost, size, weight, and power (C-SWaP). Routing traces on MEMS or application-specified integrated circuit chips as well as the input impedance of charge sensitive amplifier (CSA) are utilized as damping sources. The theoretical and experimental results indicate Q-tuning utilizing the CSA's input impedance does not deteriorate the gyro's noise floor (angle random walk = 0.01&#176;/&#8730;h, bias instability = 0.12&#176;/h). Large-scale Q-tuning using the regulation of polarization voltage reduces the sensing Q-factor from 38 to 3 k. The gyro's settling time after shock is also reduced from 1.4 to 0.13 s after Q-tuning. Besides, a frequency-independent fine Q-tuning using tail current regulation in Opam is proposed to correct the thermal variation of the sensing Q-factor. It improves the gyro's bias drift from 1.5&#176;/s to 0.2&#176;/s. This work presents a low C-SWaP Q-tuning solution for high-end industrial MEMS gyro.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Asymmetrical Quadrupolar Coil for Interoperability of Unipolar, Bipolar, and Quadrupolar Coils in Electric Vehicle Wireless Charging Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10130755</link><description>The unipolar, bipolar, and quadrupolar coils used in an electric vehicle wireless charging system are not interoperable with each other. Thus, there would be interoperability issues when the transmitting and receiving coils are not the same. To solve this issue, in this letter, we propose an asymmetrical quadrupolar coil that can be interoperable with the four conventional coils at the same position for efficient wireless power transfer, namely the unipolar coil, the bipolar coil along two perpendicular directions, and the quadrupolar coil. Large coupling coefficients can be achieved for the proposed coil with the four conventional coils when perfectly aligned. The misalignment performance with the four conventional coils is also investigated. An experimental prototype is developed to compare the conventional symmetrical quadrupolar coil with the proposed asymmetrical quadrupolar coil for validation of interoperability. The proposed asymmetrical quadrupolar coil achieves a maximum coupling coefficient of over 0.10 and a maximum dc&#8211;dc efficiency of over 85% with the four conventional coils.</description></item><item><title>Source-Load Scenario Generation Based on Weakly Supervised Adversarial Learning and Its Data-Driven Application in Energy Storage Capacity Sizing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10076917</link><description>The historical measured data of renewable energy sources and loads can be processed in various ways to generate scenarios for energy storage planning. With the development of advanced forecast technology, the valuable reference of massive forecast data accumulated by the prediction platform in scenario generation is ignored. To this end, we propose a new paradigm based on scenario generation for energy storage planning considering source-load uncertainties. First, a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) is constructed under weakly supervised learning. The network can extract the prediction errors between predicted data and measured data to generate source-load profiles. The loss function of the network is redesigned to adapt to the data generation task. To match the planning process, scenario generation and reduction algorithms are embedded in the GAN. Then, an energy storage sizing model considering battery health constraints is established. Case studies show that the proposed method can accurately portray the local fluctuation characteristics of source-load power and properly reduce conservatism compared with the model-driven method.</description></item><item><title>Optimization of Communication Network for Distributed Control of Wind Farm Equipped With Energy Storages</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10093063</link><description>Consensus based distributed control schemes have been widely applied to different operation scenarios of wind farms (WFs). However, few studies concern the influences of WF communication network topology to the consensus control performances. This paper proposes an optimal design method of the WF communication network for the consensus based re/active power regulation control of the WF, in which each individual wind turbine (WT) is equipped with an energy storage (ES) unit. Firstly, the basic model of the WT equipped with ES is presented, and the consensus based control scheme of the power regulation is described. Secondly, the optimization model for the communication network is constructed, so as to speed up the convergence rate, improve the communication survivability and reduce the communication links in the control. Thirdly, this paper proposes a bi-level alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) based solving framework, which decomposes the optimization into sub-problems. Finally, the performances of the control using the designed optimal communication network are tested and compared with other networks in the control, and the results verify the superiority of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Parameter Optimization for Var Planning of Systems With High Penetration of Wind Power: An Adaptive Equivalent Reduction Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10107491</link><description>Voltage-related issues such as dramatic voltage fluctuation, lack of Var reserves, become more prominent in high wind power penetration (HWPP) system, leading to increasing of large-scale cascading trip risks within 100&#8211;200 ms. During the cascading process, fast dynamic Var support, which is strongly related to internal parameters of Var devices, is quite crucial for HWPP system security. If device parameters optimization is also considered in the Var planning, it will be more promising to achieve less investment cost and guarantee transient security for HWPP system. However, the complex control elements and numerous internal parameters optimization cause a huge computational burden of planning issues. Therefore, this paper proposes an adaptively parameter order equivalent reduced optimization (APO-ERO) approach to efficiently and accurately solve the Var planning problem with parameter allocation. First, the original high-order Var device model is adaptively reduced to an optimal low-order model that minimizes the reduced order error. Next, an equivalent low-order optimization model in the upper layer and an inverse mapping parameter allocation model in the lower layer are established to relieve the computational burden. Finally, the two different test systems with HWPP verify that the proposed method can improve computational efficiency on the premise of guaranteeing accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Transmission Switching With Uncertainties From Both Renewable Energy and N-K Contingencies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10129825</link><description>This article focuses on the $N-k$ security-constrained optimal transmission switching (OTS) problem for variable renewable energy (VRE) penetrated power grids. A new three-stage stochastic and distributionally robust OTS model is proposed. The first stage has the primary purpose to schedule the power generation and network topology based on the forecast of VRE. The second stage controls the power generation and voltage magnitudes of voltage-controlled buses in response to VRE uncertainty, and the third stage reacts to $N\!-\!k$ contingencies additionally by line switching and load shedding. The VRE and $N\!-\!k$ contingencies, considering different availability of their probability distributions, are tackled by stochastic and distributionally robust optimization, respectively. By adopting stage-wise realization of uncertainties in VRE and contingencies, the associated corrective controls with different mechanisms can be handled separately and properly, which makes the proposed OTS model more realistic than existing two-stage ones. For solving the proposed OTS model, its tractable reformulation is derived, and a solution approach that combines the nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm and Dantzig&#8211;Wolfe procedure is developed. Finally, case studies include a simple IEEE network for illustrative purposes and then real system networks to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Solar-Mixer: An Efficient End-to-End Model for Long-Sequence Photovoltaic Power Generation Time Series Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10104151</link><description>The expansion of photovoltaic power generation makes photovoltaic power forecasting an essential requirement. With the development of deep learning, more accurate predictions have become possible. This paper proposes an efficient end-to-end model for solar power generation that allows for long-sequence time series forecasting. Two modules comprise the forecasting model: the anomaly detection module and the forecasting module. Singular values are detected and corrected by the anomaly detection module. And in the forecasting module, the series is first divided into different intervals. After that, the divided data is passed through a decomposition module embedded in the neural network, and each interval is encoded as high-dimension vectors. These vectors are fed into the mixing layer, which is used to learn the relationship between intervals and channels after the encoding process. Every mixing layer comprises two different layers: the channel-mixing layer allows communication between different channels, and the interval-mixing layer allows communication between different intervals. This neural network is purely dependent on the multilayer perceptron, resulting in a network with low system latency and low training cost. The experiments results not only show the model proposed in this paper can make accurate long-sequence time series forecasts for photovoltaic power generation at three sites but also show that the model can defeat the state-of-the-art model in long-sequence photovoltaic power generation time series forecasting work.</description></item><item><title>Energy Management in Integrated Energy System Using Energy&#8211;Carbon Integrated Pricing Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10184030</link><description>The interdependence of different energy forms and flexible energy interaction among multiagents in an integrated energy system (IES) are significant for reducing carbon emissions. Therefore, optimizing the IES to achieve low-carbon emission and economic goals is necessary. This study proposes an IES energy management method based on the energy&#8211;carbon integrated pricing method. First, a consumption-based integrated pricing model is proposed to calculate the energy&#8211;carbon integrated prices of electricity, thermal resources, and gas for energy service provider (ESP). Second, an energy management method based on the Stackelberg game is established, with the ESP as the leader and the prosumers as the followers. In the game model, the objectives of the ESP and prosumers are to maximize profit by formulating an appropriate energy&#8211;carbon integrated pricing strategy and maximize consumer surplus by optimizing load, respectively. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified using practical examples. The results indicate that the proposed method can increase the profit of ESP and reduce carbon emissions more efficiently than traditional methods.</description></item><item><title>Risk-Oriented Operational Model for Fully Renewable Cooperative Prosumers in a Modern Water-Energy Nexus Structure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158363</link><description>The day-by-day increment in the demand for diverse types of energy together with the CO2-based climate concerns has intensified the need for innovative decarbonization plans leading the energy sector to produce clean, cost-effective, and reliable multi-energy. Herein, inevitable water and power interactions unlock significant benefits for the integrated energy network in the form of water-energy nexus models. In this work, a holistic water-energy nexus model is developed for the operation of cooperative prosumers equipped with 100% renewables in the modern interconnected energy structure. The model is empowered by the transactive energy technology to allow prosumers to cooperatively share multi-energy with each other for reliably serving power and water in a deregulated environment. The proposed model also benefits from hydrogen-based energy conversion units that not only improve the flexibility of prosumers in reliable energy supply but also increase their economic achievements by selling the produced gas to the gas grid. As prosumers are targeted for fully clean energy production, their contributions in the energy interactions are under the high level of risks associated with renewables&#8217; intermittences. Due to this, a risk-averse stochastic operational model is proposed that enables the decision-maker to adopt optimal strategies against the uncertain fluctuations in the system. The effectiveness of the proposed model is examined considering prosumers located in Chicago, USA. According to the obtained results, the model can affordably facilitate the realization of Chicago's plans for achieving the goal of equipping with 100% renewable energy sources for a fully clean multi-energy generation.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Coupling Analysis and Small-Signal Stability for Multi-Parallel PLL-Synchronous VSC-Based Renewable Energy Plants During Asymmetrical LVRT</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10109833</link><description>Studying the small-signal stability for multi-parallel voltage source converter (VSC)-based renewable energy plants (REPs) during the fault steady-state of low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) in weak grid is significant for designing a stabilized controller to ensure and improve success of LVRT. Different from the independent grid-connected system and symmetric condition, in the asymmetrical fault steady-state, there are more complicated dynamic interactions between the positive-sequence (PS) and negative-sequence (NS) systems as well as between the REPs in multi-fed grid-connected system. This study unveils the dynamic coupling mechanism between REPs by deduced small-signal model during asymmetric LVRT, which provides a solid foundation for designing the novel stabilized controllers. The influence of this dynamic coupling effect between REPs on the system's small-signal stability in the asymmetrical fault steady-state is analyzed. It's shown that the dynamic coupling between REPs will be aggravated by the deteriorating asymmetrical fault, and it will cause the existing stabilized controller's performance decreasing or even invalid. Combining with small-signal stability analysis, the asymmetric fault degree's influencing mechanism on small-signal stability of multi-fed grid-connected system is revealed from the perspective of self-damping and mutual damping. Finally, simulations and experiments are carried out to validate analysis results.</description></item><item><title>Implications of Future Price Trends and Interannual Resource Uncertainty on Firm Solar Power Delivery With Photovoltaic Overbuilding and Battery Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10121691</link><description>Generation from solar is inherently variable. Through a strategic combination of excessive capacity expansion (i.e., overbuilding) and battery storage, the variable solar generation can be cost-effectively firmed up, in that, it is able to meet the required generation target with absolute certainty. Firming up solar generation implies additional cost, which can be quantified through the firm kWh premium. This paper proposes a new model for the optimization of firm kWh premium through either a mixed-integer linear program or a bilinear program, depending on whether a generic or detailed battery model is used. The (bi)linear-program formulation greatly reduces the complexity of the original iterative approach. Additionally, since the firm kWh premium is a function of photovoltaic and battery prices, we show how future price change can affect the economics of firm power delivery and whether true grid parity can be eventually achieved. Lastly, the sensitivity of the firm kWh premium to photovoltaic modeling uncertainty and inter-annual solar resource uncertainty is analyzed.</description></item><item><title>Fast Frequency Regulation From a Wind Farm-BESS Unit by Model Predictive Control: Method and Hardware-in-the-Loop Validation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10094032</link><description>The integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) into the power system requires an upgrade of the adopted management and control solutions. Focusing on frequency regulation, the same RES, as well as loads, both possibly coupled with energy storage systems, are called to provide a contribution through suitable regulation services. In this context, this paper proposes a control strategy for enabling a unit composed by a Wind Farm and Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) to provide a fast frequency regulation service. The control is based on Model Predictive Control technique, whereas the regulation service is defined according to the technical requirements of the Italian Transmission System Operator (TSO). The approach is also tested via Hardware-In-the-Loop simulations. More specifically, tests are carried out by implementing the control algorithm on a Raspberry Pi board that communicates with a real BESS and with a real-time simulator implementing a benchmark power system. The validation results prove the practical effectiveness of the proposed control method since they demonstrate that the designed algorithms can be implemented on a low-cost hardware and applied, without computational and communication issues, in a real-field framework.</description></item><item><title>Unified Dynamic Equivalent Model for Distributed Photovoltaic Generation Systems With Different Fault-Ride-Through Strategies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10168725</link><description>The grid penetration of distributed photovoltaic (DPV) energy is increasing; therefore producing equivalent models of DPV systems is critical for the dynamic analysis of power systems. In this article, a DPV system aggregation model based on interconnection point voltages and inverter types with a novel cluster and aggregation method is proposed. This model can obtain a similar power output to that obtained through simulation with a detailed model. Dynamic voltages of interconnection points and an equivalent admittance matrix were used as clustering indices in this study. These indices were weighted using an analytic hierarchy process model. Photovoltaic systems with different inverters, control strategies and fault-ride-through dynamics; grid connection points with varying electrical distances and voltage dynamics were unified in the developed model by ensuring that the power characteristics before and after aggregation were equivalent. The results of this study imply that the DPV systems in an area differ substantially in terms of output dynamics, and these dynamic features should be quantified during equivalent modeling. The proposed method obtained superior results to relevant previous methods that do not consider the fault ride throughs and voltage dynamics.</description></item><item><title>A New Multi-Resolution Closed-Loop Wind Power Forecasting Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10077762</link><description>By the increasing number and size of wind farms, wind generation forecasting has become a basic requirement for their connection to the power grid; otherwise, power system operators and electricity market participants cannot make the right decisions and may incur significant costs and penalties. In this paper, a new multi-resolution closed-loop wind power forecasting method with a difference signal feedback loop is proposed. Within the proposed method, wind power is initially predicted in two different resolutions (such as with hourly and sub-hourly time steps) by two low/high-resolution pre-predictors and then the inconsistency between their predictions is measured through the difference signal. The generated difference signal is used as a guide for the two low/high-resolution wind power post-predictors. If their wind power forecasts are inconsistent, the difference signal is updated and used as the feedback for the low/high-resolution post-predictors. This closed-loop forecasting-updating process is iterated until the post-predictors reach consistent results. To evaluate the performance of the proposed multi-resolution closed-loop method, it is tested on two different real-world wind farms and the results are compared with the results of several other widely used/recently published wind power forecast methods using various error metrics and different forecast horizons.</description></item><item><title>Risk-Aware Operating Regions for PV-Rich Distribution Networks Considering Irradiance Variability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10141679</link><description>This article proposes a framework to identify, visualize, and quantify risk of potential over/under voltage due to annual energy consumption and PV generation growth. The stochastic modeling considers the following: (i) Active and reactive power profiles for distribution transformers, dependent on annual energy consumption and activity in the serviced areas. (ii) Variable solar irradiance profiles that allow a broader range of PV generation scenarios for sunny, overcast, and cloudy days. The proposed framework uses multivariate-$t$ copulas to model temporal correlations between random variables to generate synthetic scenarios. A probabilistic power flow is computed using the generated scenarios to define critical static operating regions. Results show that classical approaches may underestimate the maximum PV capacity of distribution networks when local irradiance conditions are not considered. Moreover, it is found that including annual energy consumption growth is critical to establishing realistic PV installation capacity limits. Finally, a sensitivity analysis shows that taking a 5% of overvoltage risk could increase up to 15% of the PV installed capacity limits.</description></item><item><title>Day-Ahead Parametric Probabilistic Forecasting of Wind and Solar Power Generation Using Bounded Probability Distributions and Hybrid Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10109883</link><description>The penetration of renewable energy sources in modern power systems increases at an impressive rate. Due to their intermittent and uncertain nature, it is important to forecast their generation including its uncertainty. In this article, an ensemble artificial neural network is applied for day ahead solar and wind power generation parametric probabilistic forecasting. The proposed architecture includes two components: a sub-models component and a Meta-Learner component.

In the era of Big Data, large-scale datasets make the training of power curve models inefficient, especially for kernel-based models. Furthermore, most models do not take into account the error characteristics of WPC modeling. In this study, a large-scale generalized kernel-based regression model is proposed to solve the above problem. First, a generalized loss function, which can model both symmetric and asymmetric error distributions, is designed for model training. Then, the Nystr&#246;m technique is employed to get the approximate kernel matrix, based on which an eigenvalue-based kernel regression framework is constructed. Next, a large-scale generalized kernel-based regression model is developed with model parameters tuned using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Before WPC modeling, a three-step data processing method based on isolation forest is designed to process missing data, irrational data, and outliers in the collected data. The WPC modeling results on four large-scale wind datasets demonstrate that the proposed model generates accurate WPCs with high efficiency. Furthermore, the effect of turbulence intensity on WPC modeling and the effectiveness of LSGKRM with multivariate inputs are also verified.</description></item><item><title>Uncertainty-Aware Trading of Congestion and Imbalance Mitigation Services for Multi-DSO Local Flexibility Markets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10070801</link><description>The design of Local Flexibility Markets (LFMs) for energy and reserve dispatch of Renewable Distributed Energy Resources (RDERs) has recently been a topic of wide research. However, in an scenario with high penetration of RDERs deployed among different Distribution System Operators (DSOs) jurisdictions, further operational requirements concerning congestion and imbalance mitigation services may lay down. In this context, the relationship between capacity and energy products and the uncertainty management scheme becomes essential for procuring of RDERs flexibility. This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware Multi-DSO LFM. This market setting uses flexibility products to mitigate congestions and imbalances among different DSOs. First, capacity products hold back the flexibility of the RDERs in anticipation of contingencies. Then, energy products are activated within each time slot if the event finally occurs. LFM is solved in a coordinated and decentralised fashion using the properties of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), preserving participants' privacy. Uncertainty of RDERs and energy events duration are modelled using chance-constraint linear optimisation. The proposed methodology has been tested in a case study based on a realistic dataset and radial distribution systems.</description></item><item><title>Control Co-Design of Power Take-Off Systems for Wave Energy Converters Using WecOptTool</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10114969</link><description>Improved power take-off (PTO) controller design for wave energy converters is considered a critical component for reducing the cost of energy production. However, the device and control design process often remains sequential, with the space of possible final designs largely reduced before the controller has been considered. Control co-design, whereby the device and control design are considered concurrently, has resulted in improved designs in many industries, but remains rare in the wave energy community. In this paper we demonstrate the use of a new open-source code, WecOptTool, for control co-design of wave energy converters, with the aim to make the co-design approach more accessible and accelerate its adoption. Additionally, we highlight the importance of designing a wave energy converter to maximize electrical power, rather than mechanical power, and demonstrate the co-design process while modeling the PTO's components (i.e., drive-train and generator, and their dynamics). We also consider the design and optimization of causal fixed-structure controllers. The demonstration presented here considers the PTO design problem and finds the optimal PTO drive-train that maximizes annual electrical power production. The results show a 22% improvement in the optimal controller and drive-train co-design over the optimal controller for the nominal, as built, device design.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Fast and Accurate MPPT Control Structure for Mobile PV System Under Fast-Changing Atmospheric Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10077787</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) system efficiency is highly dependent on atmospheric conditions, which are continuously varying. The presence of an efficient maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method suitable for fast-changing environmental conditions, even under partial shading conditions (PSC) is required to optimize the PV system efficiency. This paper proposes a different MPPT control structure, where the MPPT is nested in the proportional-integral (PI) voltage controller routine. By using the proposed control structure. The Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) samples are shared between the MPPT algorithm and PI controller. As a result, extreme dynamic tracking improvements while a cost-effective implementation is ensured. Using the proposed control structure, a high-speed MPPT is achieved, making it suitable for mobile PV systems subjected to fast-changing atmospheric conditions. As the tracking accuracy is high, the P&amp;amp;O subroutine usually used in GMPPT methods to maintain the GMPP is eliminated. Results revealed that with the proposed implementation scheme, the tracking speed and the transient energy losses can be four times better than the traditional scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Novel MPP Estimation Technique for DDM PV Array Under Different Solar Irradiance Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10180036</link><description>This article derives a new explicit expression of current of a double-diode model (DDM) photovoltaic (PV) module from the implicit current-voltage (I-V) expression. Here, the exponential term of the I-V expression of a DDM PV module is represented by Taylor series. The validation is done on the implicit I-V expression with the derived quartic I-V explicit expression for PV modules of different rating under different environmental conditions (DEC). The estimation of maximum power point (MPP) is done using one dimensional Newton Raphson (NR) algorithm in the MPP region and proposed explicit expression. The proposed technique is also compared with the different existing MPP estimation techniques for DEC. The results show better accuracy of the proposed technique over the existing methods. Finally, a new mathematical model of totally cross tied (TCT) configuration of a PV array under partially shaded conditions is derived and the global MPP is estimated using an intelligent search algorithm i.e., genetic algorithm. Further, a 315 W PV module was considered for real time validation of the proposed technique under uniform irradiance condition. Also, the calculated global MPP of a DDM PV array of TCT configuration is validated with experimental results for different shading conditions.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Battery Energy Storage Control for Multi-Service Provision Using a Semidefinite Programming-Based Battery Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10089191</link><description>Battery energy storage systems (BESS) capable of simultaneously providing multiple grid services can assist a distribution grid operator in overcoming various challenges due to the high penetration of distributed solar photovoltaics and accelerated electrification. The seamless provision of multiple services can be ensured with BESS control decisions based on an accurate model reflecting the battery characteristics. Thus, this paper presents a novel Li-ion battery model based on linear matrix inequalities along with a semidefinite programming (SDP)-based model to determine the optimal BESS control decisions for the provision of multiple services in distribution systems. Peak shaving, power factor improvement, and electricity cost savings are considered for the services. Moreover, the mathematical analysis reveals that the original nonconvex problem can be equivalently transformed into the SDP model. The effectiveness of using BESS in the distribution system is verified through simulations using real-world data. Ultimately, a comparative analysis with a conventional linear model demonstrates that the proposed battery model reduces the energy losses in the batteries, in the simulation condition, and help maintain the battery states within normal operating limits.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming Services From Hydrogen Electrolyzers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10108044</link><description>Hydrogen electrloyzers are power-to-gas storage devices that can facilitate large-scale integration of intermittent renewable sources into the future power systems. Due to their fast response and capability to operate in different loading conditions, they can be used as responsive loads providing support to AC grid during transients. This paper suggests taking one step further and using hydrogen electrolyzers to provide grid-forming services to the grid. As a result, the electrolyzer's role is elevated from supporting the grid (responsive load) to actively participating in forming voltage and frequency of the grid. The grid-forming capability of electrolyzer is linked to its hydrogen production constraints, which can potentially pose limitations on the grid-forming services. Besides the grid-forming mode, two additional operating modes, i.e., DC voltage mode and constant power mode, are proposed to ensure a safe operation of the electrolyzer in case of adversary interaction between grid-forming operation and hydrogen production constraints. This paper also studies the impacts of grid-forming services on the electrolyzer's physical features such as hydrogen stack temperature and efficiency. Comprehensive simulations are conducted on a low-inertia test network whose topology is inspired by a portion of the transmission grid in South Australia to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed concept under various operational conditions of the electrolyzer and upstream AC grid. Moreover, the practical feasibility of the proposed control system is experimentally validated by conducting hardware-in-the-loop tests.</description></item><item><title>Chance-Constrained Joint Dispatch of Generation and Wind Curtailment-Load Shedding Schemes With Large-Scale Wind Power Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10104113</link><description>Wind curtailment (WC) and load shedding (LS) are indispensable measures to mitigate the operational risk in high-renewable power systems. Moreover, WC and LS schemes should be pre-scheduled and confirmed by related entities to make them applicable. In this article, we propose a novel chance-constrained economic dispatch (CCED) model which can generate optimal WC and LS schemes accounting for the reserve shortage and transmission congestion problems. In the proposed method, WC and LS power are formulated as random decision variables, with which the infeasibility issues of conventional CCED are fully addressed. To solve the proposed model, we first convert the complicated chance constraints into a set of deterministic inequalities equivalently by employing the conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) representation and duality theory. Then, a two-layer iterative algorithm is proposed to solve the equivalent problem efficiently, which is based on the generalized Benders decomposition (GBD) framework. Numerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Chance-Constrained Generic Energy Storage Operations Under Decision-Dependent Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10081472</link><description>Compared with large-scale physical batteries, aggregated and coordinated generic energy storage (GES) resources provide low-cost, but uncertain, flexibility for power grid operations. While GES can be characterized by different types of uncertainty, the literature mostly focuses on decision-independent uncertainties (DIUs), such as exogenous stochastic disturbances caused by weather conditions. Instead, this manuscript focuses on newly-introduced decision-dependent uncertainties (DDUs) and considers an optimal GES dispatch that accounts for uncertain available state-of-charge (SoC) bounds that are affected by incentive signals and discomfort levels. To incorporate DDUs, we present a novel chance-constrained optimization (CCO) approach for the day-ahead economic dispatch of GES units. Two tractable methods are presented to solve the proposed CCO problem with DDUs: (i) a robust reformulation for general but incomplete distributions of DDUs, and (ii) an iterative algorithm for specific and known distributions of DDUs. Furthermore, reliability indices are introduced to verify the applicability of the proposed approach with respect to the reliability of the response of GES units. Simulation-based analysis shows that the proposed methods yield conservative, but credible, GES dispatch strategies and reduced penalty cost by incorporating DDUs in the constraints and leveraging data-driven parameter identification. This results in improved availability and performance of coordinated GES units.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Partial Shading Detection for Photovoltaic Generation Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10111045</link><description>Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) is the core technology for harvesting maximum power from Photovoltaic Power Generation Systems (PVGS). Global MPPT (GMPPT) algorithms have been broadly proposed in the past few years for PVGSs under Partial Shading (PS); however, most of these algorithms make the speed of MPPT slower and consequently lead to more tracking losses when there is no PS. Therefore, an efficient PS Detection (PSD) for PVGSs is proposed in the paper. The proposed PSD estimates the solar irradiance and temperature of a PVGS by the characteristic output function and measured voltages and currents. The occurrence of PS can then be detected by the estimated solar irradiance and temperature along with the proposed PS factor. After the PS condition of a PVGS was determined, the appropriate MPPTs can be chosen to track the MPP effectively and efficiently. This can accelerate MPPT performance, reduce tracking time, and improve power generation efficiency. Simulation results show that the detection accuracy of the proposed PSD can exceed 99% under different PS and temperature conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the validity and performance of the proposed PSD for PVGSs.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Energy Management of Microgrid Based on Blockchain-Empowered Consensus Algorithm With Collusion Prevention</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10075483</link><description>The concern for privacy and scalability has motivated a paradigm shift to decentralized energy management methods in microgrids. The absence of a central authority brings significant challenges to promote trusted collaboration and avoid collusion. To address these issues, this paper proposes a blockchain-empowered microgrid energy management framework, which adopts a novel consensus-based algorithm with a collusion prevention mechanism. Aiming at social welfare maximization, the energy management problem is formulated into a convex and decomposable form, which can be solved in a decentralized manner. To prevent the collusion between malicious agents, we propose a random information transmission mechanism empowered by the blockchain smart contract to replace the time-invariant communication topology. The consensus-based algorithm is extended to obtain the optimal solution of the energy management problem on the random and time-varying communication topology. We theoretically proved that the proposed algorithm converges to the global optimal solution with a probability of 1, without violating the physical constraints of individual agents. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated by multiple experiments, both within the simulation environment and on a hardware system.</description></item><item><title>Membership-Function-Based Secondary Frequency Regulation for Distributed Energy Resources in Islanded Microgrids With Communication Delay Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10098785</link><description>Secondary frequency control is one of the most effective measures to ensure the stable operation of islanded microgrids (MGs). Most research on secondary frequency regulation has only focused on realizing steady-state operation objectives, that is, frequency restoration and power sharing. However, improving the dynamic performance of secondary frequency control is of great importance, especially in synchronous distributed energy resources. These synchronous units can introduce undesired oscillation modes, which may cause the instability conditions of MGs. To improve the dynamic performance of islanded MGs, a membership-function (MF) -based control strategy is proposed. The proposed strategy can trade-off between transient frequency regulation and frequency error elimination using the MF values calculated by the time-stamped synchronized measurements of distribution-level phasor measurement units. Besides, considering the time-varying communication delays in secondary frequency control loops, an adaptive delay compensator is proposed. The weights of the proposed compensator are updated by real-time delay measurements to compensate for the phase lag of control signals. Therefore, the adverse effect of communication delays on secondary frequency control is weakened effectively. Numerical simulations on an IEEE 34-bus system and a typical 40-bus islanded MG system demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in the secondary frequency regulation of islanded MGs.</description></item><item><title>A Risk-Based Planning Approach for Sustainable Distribution Systems Considering EV Charging Stations and Carbon Taxes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10081007</link><description>Adopting distributed energy resources (DERs) is the key to a low-carbon future in electrical distribution systems (EDS). However, integrating DERs increases the uncertainties in the distribution system expansion planning (DSEP). Thus, the long-term DSEP faces a planning risk brought by the uncertainty of demand, electric vehicle (EV) demand, renewable production, and energy prices. Therefore, this work proposes a novel model for the multi-period planning of EDSs and DERs considering conditional value at risk (CVaR) to manage fluctuations in generation cost and carbon emissions. The proposed mathematical model aims to minimize the net present cost related to investment, operation, and risk. Unlike previous approaches, uncertain behavior of demand growth per planning period is addressed, and the risk is evaluated from two perspectives: planning costs and carbon taxes. Investments in substations, lines, renewable distributed generation, EV charging stations, and energy storage systems are considered. The uncertainties associated with the variability of renewable generation and demand are modeled through a set of scenarios. Finally, the model was evaluated using the 24 and 54-bus EDS. Thus, the proposal is a flexible tool that can be used for different purposes (e.g., carbon taxes, budget limits).</description></item><item><title>Integrated Assessment of the Reliability and Frequency Deviation Risks in Power Systems Considering the Frequency Regulation of DFIG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10158432</link><description>Recently, frequency regulation strategies have been widely adopted in the operation and control of doubly fed induction generator-based wind turbines (DFIG-WTs). Thus, wind power, which is becoming an increasingly important energy source, is expected to play a significant role in both power generation and frequency regulation in modern power systems. Under such circumstances, maintaining the reliability and frequency of power systems at a designated level may be more challenging due to inherent uncertainties in wind power generation. In this article, the integrated assessment of the reliability and frequency deviation risks of power systems with a high penetration level of wind power is investigated. A multi-time scale analytical framework is proposed to calculate the integrated reliability and frequency deviation indices. The coupling between the reliability and frequency deviation is further addressed by developing a novel frequency-sensitive reliability model of the electric generator. Frequency deviations under supply/demand fluctuations and device failures are analyzed, and the power system frequency regulation process is modeled with the fuzzy adaptive virtual inertial response of DFIG-WTs and energy storage system (ESS). Furthermore, IEEE-RTS79 is used to verify the validity of the proposed model and solution method.</description></item><item><title>Active Power Control of Wind Turbine Generators Considering Equilibrium Point Optimization Under Passive Rotor Speed Variation Mode</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185144</link><description>With the deepening penetration of wind generation in power systems, it is urgent that wind turbine generators (WTG) can have active power control (APC) capabilities, i.e., WTG can adjust active power output according to the power command from wind farms. The improvement of APC performance is closely related to the rotor speed variation (RSV) mode and the optimal setting of stable equilibrium points (SEP). Compared with the active RSV with the same SEP, the passive RSV no longer focuses on the rotor speed tracking and has lower power response discrepancy and drive-train loads. However, limited by the realization principle, APC based on passive RSV overlooks the optimization and setting of SEP, which makes the rotor speed of WTG easily reach the bound of the variable-speed range and leads to speed overshoot and power drops. Hence, this paper proposes an APC method with additional pitch angle compensation. Consequently, WTG under passive RSV has the ability of optimizing and setting SEP. On this basis, the compensation pitch angle is dynamically optimized according to the predicted wind speed. The experimental results show that the proposed strategy can effectively reduce speed overshoot and power drops while taking full advantages of passive RSV.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Timescale Coordinated Control With Optimal Network Reconfiguration Using Battery Storage System in Smart Distribution Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10083248</link><description>This paper focuses on the global optimality of the relaxed solutions of a multi-timescale co-optimization problem. The proposed co-optimization framework involves the multi-timescale co-optimization of distribution feeder reconfiguration with the optimal dispatch of traditional voltage regulating devices and utility-scale distributed energy resources. The on-load tap changer (OLTC) is scheduled on an hourly basis while the potential of fast-acting battery energy storage system and photovoltaic inverters is exploited by dispatching them on a 20-min basis. The optimal switching plan is computed on a daily basis. The proposed multi-timescale co-optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone program to achieve global optimum. The objective is to reduce power losses and improve load balancing among feeders. The proposed co-optimization framework satisfies the grid security constraints by employing the accurate DistFlow branch equations and exact linearization of the OLTC model. To ensure radiality, the limitation of widely used spanning tree constraints is addressed by combining them with single-commodity flow constraints. The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility (hence global optimality) of the relaxed solutions computed by the co-optimization framework.</description></item><item><title>Conservative Sparse Neural Network Embedded Frequency-Constrained Unit Commitment With Distributed Energy Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10104114</link><description>The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) will decrease the rotational inertia of the power system and further degrade the system frequency stability. To address the above issues, this article leverages the advanced neural network (NN) to learn the frequency dynamics and incorporates NN to facilitate system reliable operation. This article proposes the conservative sparse neural network (CSNN) embedded frequency-constrained unit commitment (FCUC) with converter-based DERs, including the learning and optimization stages. In the learning stage, it samples the inertia parameters, calculates the corresponding frequency, and characterizes the stability region of the sampled parameters using the convex hulls to ensure stability and avoid extrapolation. For conservativeness, the positive prediction error penalty is added to the loss function to prevent possible frequency requirement violation. For the sparsity, the NN topology pruning is employed to eliminate unnecessary connections for solving acceleration. In the optimization stage, the trained CSNN is transformed into mixed-integer linear constraints using the big-M method and then incorporated to establish the data-enhanced model. The case study verifies 1) the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of high accuracy, fewer parameters, and significant solving acceleration; 2) the stable system operation against frequency violation under contingency.</description></item><item><title>Analysis of Subsynchronous Oscillation Caused by Multiple VSCs With Different Dynamics Under Strong Grid Connections</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10103179</link><description>It is known that multiple voltage source converters (VSCs) with similar dynamics may induce subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs), particularly under weak grid connections. This study investigated the small-signal stability of multiple VSCs with different dynamics, utilizing both the model with default parameters and the model that accounts for deviations in VSC dynamics. The results indicates that the DC voltage control loops of the VSCs may cause growing SSOs even under strong grid connections. The direction and amplitude of the deviations are affected by the differences between the actual and default parameters. The impact of deviations is the largest when all the parameters are larger or smaller than the default parameters. However, the impact is reduced when some of the parameters are larger and others are smaller than the default parameters. On this basis, two reduced-order stability analysis methods were proposed to quickly and accurately assess the SSO risk in the power system. A sample power system with multiple VSCs is used to demonstrate and evaluate the conclusions and proposed methods.</description></item><item><title>An Improved FCS-MPC Strategy for Low-Frequency Oscillation Stabilization of PV-Based Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10076912</link><description>With the rapid promotion of photovoltaic (PV) power generation, the local consumption of distributed PV power generation at medium and low voltage levels widely forms PV-based microgrids. The continuous increase in the penetration rate of uncertain PV power generation requires it to actively participate in the frequency and voltage regulation of weak microgrid systems. Finite control set-model predictive control (FCS-MPC) for voltage source converter (VSC) shows remarkable advantages in fast dynamic response and robustness compared with traditional cascaded linear control methods. However, the traditional FCS-MPC method for VSC without considering the DC-link voltage dynamics of the PV generators will face oscillations of power and frequency in PV-based microgrids. In this paper, to suppress the low-frequency oscillation issue caused by PV generations, an improved FCS-MPC (I-FCS-MPC) strategy considering the DC-link dynamics of PV generation is proposed, in which the AC side and DC side of the VSC are comprehensively considered to enhance the dynamic performance of the PV-based microgrids. Moreover, a DC-link voltage regulation mechanism is introduced, enabling the PV generators to operate in the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) mode. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy comprehensively.</description></item><item><title>Fault Ride-Through Strategies for Synchronverter-Interfaced Energy Resources Under Asymmetrical Grid Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10120995</link><description>Synchronverters are inverters controlled to behave like synchronous generators. However, unbalanced faults or voltage dips may stimulate synchronverters to generate excessive currents and cause instantaneous active and reactive power oscillations at twice the grid's fundamental frequency. Therefore, this article proposes three fault ride-through (FRT) strategies to remedy these power oscillations and the unlimited current generation during unbalanced faults. The first strategy is based on an instantaneous active and reactive control that significantly reduces power oscillations. The second strategy relies on an average active and reactive control that ensures the delivery of average active and reactive power and maintains sinusoidal phase currents. Finally, the third FRT strategy employs a comprehensive instantaneous active and reactive control to eliminate power oscillations and maintain sinusoidal currents simultaneously. The proposed FRT strategies are equipped with a power management controller that delivers the required active and reactive power during normal operation and limits the inverter's phase currents during faults. Further, the proposed FRT strategies maintain the intrinsic features of synchronverters and ensure seamless activation of the proposed FRT strategies. Comparative results confirm the efficacy of the proposed strategies to reduce power oscillations, limit current generation, maintain synchronverters&#8217; intrinsic features, and comply with grid codes.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Control of a Hydrostatic Wind Turbine-Based Farm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10109125</link><description>This paper leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to develop an efficient control system for a wind farm comprising a new type of wind turbines with hydrostatic transmission. The primary motivation for hydrostatic wind turbines (HWT) is increased reliability, and reduced manufacturing, operating, and maintaining costs by removing troublesome components and reducing nacelle weight. Nevertheless, the high system complexity of HWT and the wake effect pose significant challenges for the control of HWT-based wind farms. We therefore propose a MARL algorithm named multi-agent policy optimization (MAPO), which allows agents (turbines) to gradually improve their control policies by repeatedly interacting with the environment to learn an optimal operation curve for wind farms. Simulation results based on a wind farm simulator, FAST.Farm, show that MAPO outperforms the greedy policy and a popular learning-based method, multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), in terms of power generation.</description></item><item><title>An Optimal Operation Strategy for Collaborative Flexibility Provision of a Carbon Capture and Utilization Process With Wind Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10075064</link><description>Improving power system flexibility by responsive demand is essential for integrating wind energy with a high level of variability in power systems. Carbon dioxide-based chemical processes as energy-intensive industrial loads may offer a vast potential of new forms of flexible operation due to their existing control infrastructure and storage capabilities. However, a collaborative decision model is needed for optimal energy sharing among the chemical plant and the grid under the variations and uncertainties of wind power. This study develops an optimal two-stage stochastic programming model for a novel flexible operation strategy of the chemical process coupled with wind turbines. In the proposed control scheme, a small-scale wind farm provides the power input of a chemical plant. Wind turbines are connected to the grid and actively participate in the day-ahead energy and reserve markets, considering the chemical plant as a source of flexibility. An equivalent scenario-based model of the proposed optimization problem is suggested using the Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) for a data-driven prediction of stochastic variables. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of the proposed approach for an optimal and collaborative contribution in ancillary market of a carbon dioxide-based chemical plant supplied by wind energy.</description></item><item><title>Conditional Variational Autoencoder Informed Probabilistic Wind Power Curve Modeling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10145801</link><description>In this article, a conditional variational autoencoder based method is proposed for the probabilistic wind power curve modeling task. To advance the modeling performance, the latent random variable is introduced to characterize underlying weather and wind turbine conditions. The infinite Gaussian mixture model is adopted to better model the asymmetric and heterogeneous conditional distribution of the wind power given the wind speed. The conditional variational autoencoder is composed of an encoder and a decoder network. The encoder infers the state of the latent random variable given the wind speed and wind power, while the decoder learns the observational conditional distribution of the wind power given the wind speed and latent variable. With a well-trained conditional variational autoencoder, the conditional probability density function of the wind power could be estimated through the decoder network by sampling the latent random variable from its prior distribution. Wind turbine supervisory control and data acquisition datasets are used in experiments to validate advantages of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other benchmarking deterministic and probabilistic wind power curve models with the lower continuous ranked probability score and more reliable and sharper prediction intervals. Experiments also reflect the better robustness of the conditional variational autoencoder to data pre-processed using univariate or multivariate inputs, as well as its superiority and potential for the wind power estimation considering multivariate inputs.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Weighted-Gradient Descent Method With Smoothing Momentum for Distributed Energy Management of Multi-Microgrids Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10070441</link><description>Distributed optimization methods are powerful tools to deal with complex systems. However, the slow convergence rates of some widely used distributed methods have restricted their applications. In this paper, a dynamic weighted-gradient descent method is proposed to improve the convergence rate significantly, where the construction of the dynamic weighted matrix is the key of our distributed method. To form the matrix, the maximal differences of gradients between neighbor agents are calculated to derive entries of the matrix, which is an effective way to accelerate convergence while the equality constraint is always satisfied. Furthermore, the momentum terms based on the last updates of decision variables are also introduced, which reduce frequent change of gradients and speed up convergence rates further. Next, two propositions and a theorem are proved in the analysis of convergence part, which show the values of objective functions are monotonically decreasing to optima. Finally, simulations are carried out, and the results show that for a given accuracy, the number of iterations of our method are only one fourth of three widely used methods or even less. Additionally, applying our method, the optimal dispatches in a multi-microgrid (MMG) system are achieved fast in a distributed manner, and the MMG can still work well, even if agents fail on communication networks.</description></item><item><title>Aggregate Modeling of Thermostatically Controlled Loads for Microgrid Energy Management Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10064358</link><description>Second-to-second renewable power fluctuations can severely hinder the frequency regulation performance of modern isolated microgrids, as these typically have a low inertia and significant renewable energy integration. In this context, the present paper studies the coordinated control of Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCLs) for managing short-term power imbalances, and their integration in microgrid operations through the use of aggregate TCL models. In particular, two computationally efficient and accurate aggregate TCL models are developed: a virtual battery model representing the aggregate flexibility of TCLs considering solar irradiance heat gains and wall/floor heat transfers, and a frequency transient model representing the aggregate dynamics of a TCL collection considering communication delays and the presence of model uncertainty and time-variability. The proposed aggregate TCL models are then used to design a practical Energy Management System (EMS) integrating TCL flexibility, and study the impact of TCL integration on microgrid operation and frequency control. Computational experiments using detailed frequency transient and thermal dynamic models are presented, demonstrating the accuracy of the proposed aggregate TCL models, as well as the economic and reliability benefits resulting from using these aggregate models to integrate TCLs in microgrid operations.</description></item><item><title>PSO Tuning of a Second-Order Sliding-Mode Controller for Adjusting Active Standard Power Levels for Smart Inverter Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10064339</link><description>In recent years, due to their ability to supply electricity in isolated places where building electrical transmission networks are expensive, Microgrids (MGs) have gained much attention. A new technology called smart inverters (SIs) is currently implemented in inverter-based MGs. SIs are designed to regulate energy under given standards for connecting inverters to the grid. The closed-loop control of SIs technology is still under study and improvement due to several challenges in fields such as stability and reliability. This paper proposes a DQ control for active power regulation on a single-phase voltage source inverter (SPVSI) using a second order sliding mode control (SMC-2) for addressing the abovementioned concerns. The SMC-2 tuning is performed by a metaheuristic algorithm known as particle swarm optimization (PSO). Moreover, to simulate domestic MGs, the SPSVI operation for tracking active power values is performed by ramp rate references based on standard IEEE Std 1547&#8211;2018 for inverters connected to the grid. The SMC-2 was appropriately tuned by a PSO algorithm through MATLAB&#8482; and the system simulation through PSCAD&#8482;.

Traditional modeling and solving methods fail to balance between the simulation accuracy and efficiency, and they are not flexible enough to adapt to converters with various new topologies. This article proposed a widely applicable modeling and simulation method based on the unit switching circuit that greatly promote the simulation efficiency and modeling simplicity by converting switching circuits into constant sub-grid equations with injection functions. Critical issues for engineering applications, such as the blocking state and the triggering deadband of converters, were also discussed and addressed by boundary balance and conduction path estimation. The error and stability of the solving method were qualitatively analyzed, with further discussions on the validity and numerical features. Several cases, including common and general cases and a real project of power electronic microgrid, tested and verified the accuracy, generalization ability, and efficiency of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Predictive Secondary Control With Soft Constraints for Optimal Dispatch in Hybrid AC/DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10081021</link><description>Hybrid AC/DC microgrids (H-MGs) are a prominent solution for integrating distributed generation and modern AC and DC loads. However, controlling these systems is challenging as multiple electrical variables need to be controlled and coordinated. To provide flexibility to the control system, these variables can be regulated to specific values or within secure bands. This paper proposes a set of distributed model predictive control schemes for the secondary control level to control certain variables to specific values and other variables within secure pre-defined bands into H-MGs. Specifically, optimal dispatch of active and reactive power is achieved while frequency and voltages are regulated within secure bands in H-MGs. Dynamic models of AC generators, DC generators and interlinking converters along with their novel multi-objective cost functions are developed in constrained distributed predictive optimisation problems to simultaneously achieve the aforementioned objectives via information sharing. Extensive simulation work validates the performance of this proposal.</description></item><item><title>Digital-Power-Communication Concept for Energy Coordination in PV-Battery-Charging DC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10083259</link><description>A new digital-power-communication (DPC) concept is proposed to better realize information interaction and energy coordination in the PV-battery-charging DC microgrid, which uses the DPC auxiliary power supply as carrier. The DPC auxiliary power supply can be used to replace other communication modules as a common carrier for auxiliary power supply and information interaction of microgrid interface converter. Then, the implementation conditions of DPC are indicated that this communication concept requires active power consumption and an adjustable resonant network. Meanwhile, an appropriate circuit topology of the DPC auxiliary power supply is evolved. Furthermore, an integrated control method of optimal-admittance information regulation &amp; power supply is further proposed for the DPC auxiliary power supply, and the implementation mechanism of this method is analyzed in detail by establishing the admittance model. More importantly, based on this method, the contradiction between power supply quality and signal intensity can be solved in the transmit mode, and the received signal intensity of the communicating node can be significantly enhanced in the receive mode. Finally, the PV-battery-charging DC microgrid platform is developed, and the experiment result verify the feasibility of the DPC concept and the effectiveness of the proposed control method.</description></item><item><title>Synchronization Stability of Grid-Following VSC Considering Interactions of Inner Current Loop and Parallel-Connected Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10086546</link><description>In the grid-following (GFL) voltage source converter (VSC), the synchronization process of phase-locked loop (PLL) can be seriously affected by the interactions from the inner current loop and other parallel-connected VSCs. In this paper, we focus on the influences of these interactions on the synchronization stability of GFL-VSC. Firstly, these interactions are classified into static and dynamic interactions by the mechanism of how they affect the dynamic of PLL. Then, their influence on the synchronization stability is estimated based on a novel Lyapunov stability criterion, which is derived from the extended invariance principle. On this basis, in terms of the physical mechanism, we reveal how the VSC exhibits the non-asymptotic synchronization (i.e., limit cycles) and cascading synchronization instability. In addition, we get the maximum range of static and dynamic interactions that the VSC endure, which can provide the practical design guidance for the VSC. Finally, simulations and experiments are performed to verify the theoretical findings.</description></item><item><title>A Consensus-Based Distributed Secondary Control Optimization Strategy for Hybrid Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10086678</link><description>In this paper, a new consensus-based distributed secondary control (DSC) strategy is proposed for frequency control, dc -voltage regulation, and optimal dispatch (OD) in isolated hybrid ac/dc - microgrids (HMGs). At the same time, all the units are maintained within limits. The proposed control scheme dispatches the distributed generators (DGs) within the microgrid in compliance with the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of a linear optimal power flow (OPF) formulation. Furthermore, the power through the interlinking converters (ICs) is also dispatched to help minimize the total operation cost of the microgrid. The controllers rely on local measurements and information from neighbouring devices at both sides of the microgrid (DGs and ICs). Thus, unlike conventional methods, the microgrid is considered a single entity and not as three independent systems interacting with one another, and the OD is calculated considering both the ac -DGs and dc -DGs. Extensive simulations demonstrate a good performance of the controller amid load step changes and unit congestion, driving the system to an optimal economic operation.</description></item><item><title>Three-Stage Stochastic Unit Commitment for Microgrids Toward Frequency Security via Renewable Energy Deloading</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10088426</link><description>Renewable energy is boosting the deployment of microgrids (MGs) with stochastic and low inertia nature. To improve the operational efficiency of MGs while guaranteeing frequency security, a three-stage stochastic unit commitment problem is proposed, where renewable energy can be deloaded. In the first stage, the diesel generators (DGs) are scheduled, responding to uncertainties of loads and photovoltaic generator output. In the second stage, the outputs of DGs are optimized to reduce the operational cost under uncertain disturbances. In the third stage, a novel PV deloading strategy is proposed to test the frequency security of MGs. The three-stage optimization problem is formulated as a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem with recourse. This problem is then solved using a novel nested Benders decomposition algorithm with both dual cuts and partial primal cuts. Simulations are performed on an AC MG under different PV penetration levels and disturbances. The results verify the effectiveness of the proposed model in balancing operational efficiency, renewable energy utilization, and frequency security.</description></item><item><title>CoLinFlow: An Iterative Solution Approach for the Scenario-Based AC OPF in Active Meshed Distribution Grids With Batteries</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10059137</link><description>Distribution grids are characterized by an increased installation of renewable energy sources (RESs) and of batteries. Both the uncertainty of RESs and the controllability of batteries should be considered when optimizing their operation. This leads to large-scale, non-convex Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems. Existing solution approaches either refer to radial grids or do not work under uncertainty. However, many Distribution System Operators operate their grids in meshed topologies. In this paper, CoLinFlow, an efficient solution approach for a scenario-based AC OPF in meshed balanced three-phase distribution grids with intermittent RESs and controllable batteries is proposed. First, a particular power flow form in rectangular coordinates that is accurate for meshed grids is applied. Then, Generalized Linearized Power Flow (GLPF), a novel linearization of the power flow equations based on replacing non-linear terms with constants is developed. Based on GLPF, we design CoLinFlow, a heuristic iterative scheme that at each iteration solves a convex OPF and updates GLPF until convergence. The solution of CoLinFlow at convergence is proven to be feasible with respect to the original non-convex OPF and convergence is reached after very few iterations. Also, it is shown that CoLinFlow achieves almost the same optimal objective as Ipopt, while being faster.</description></item><item><title>Recursive Secondary Controller for Voltage Profile Improvement Based on Primary Virtual Admittance Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10059146</link><description>This paper proposes a recursive, virtual admittance based, secondary controller for DG units that improves the voltage profile in distribution networks. First, the adaptation of the virtual admittance concept for the goal of voltage regulation is explained. Then, a recursive secondary controller is developed to periodically update the virtual admittance gains. The controller is formulated as an optimization problem with current and stability limitations as constraints. Measurements across the grid, transmitted through low-bandwidth communications, are used to simplify the calculations, resulting in a recursive algorithm. Weight vectors are included in the objective function to allow participation flexibility of each converter. Results show that the primary virtual admittance controller is able to mitigate over- and undervoltages in steady state and under transient conditions. Subsequently, the secondary controller is shown to further improve the voltage profiles across the grid. Experimental results obtained from a laboratory environment, comprising three DG units and a grid emulator, validate the functionality of the complete control structure.</description></item><item><title>Accurate Identification of Critical Boundary Hyperplanes of Practical Steady-State Security Region in Distribution Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10083260</link><description>The practical steady-state security region (PSSR) in distribution grids describes the region where the power flow can be managed securely. The PSSR is irrelevant to operation states and its boundaries can be approximated by hyperplanes (HPs). Benefit from these, the PSSR can dramatically simplify complicated optimal scheduling problems, such as deliverable energy flexibility scheduling. However, calculating the PSSR boundaries corresponding to all the power flow security constraints indiscriminately will theoretically produce lots of HPs to bound the whole PSSR and thus make solving of the PSSR-based optimal scheduling challenging. In fact, the whole PSSR is the intersection of the regions bounded by all the HPs within practical power injection ranges, and only a few HPs, called the critical boundary hyperplanes (CHPs), can bound it. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the CHPs before applying them to the optimal scheduling as power flow security constraints, so as to accelerate the solution. In this paper, a fast and accurate method is first proposed to identify the CHPs. The identified results are irrelevant to the specific objective and can be applied to different optimal scheduling problems. The proposed method is applied to several case-study networks and the results demonstrate its effectiveness and speed.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Optimization of Integrated Energy Systems Considering Renewable Energy Uncertainty and Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10057039</link><description>In this study, the multi-objective optimization considering renewable energy uncertainty and electric vehicles (EVs) is proposed for regional integrated energy systems (RIES), which can balance the economy and environmental friendliness of the system. Firstly, the influence of factors such as disordered access and charging/discharging of EVs on system operation is considered, an orderly charging and discharging model of EVs is established according to the driving laws. Then, a robust optimization model with polyhedral uncertainty set is constructed to handle the uncertainty of renewable energy output. Moreover, the minimizing operation cost and carbon emissions is developed as the multi-objective function, and the carbon emission penalty factor is introduced to convert the multi-objective into single objective solution. Finally, the validation is carried out by an actual RIES. The case studies verify the proposed method can well balance the economy and environmental protection of the system, and enhance robustness against the uncertainty while realizing the economic and optimal operation of the system.</description></item><item><title>Interval-Probabilistic Electricity-Heat-Gas Flow Calculation by Dual-Level Surrogate Structure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10091561</link><description>The study of highly efficient methods for performing multiple energy flow (MEF) computation with epistemic and aleatory uncertainties, known as interval-probabilistic energy flow (IPEF) calculation, is a fast-growing area of research. However, existing approaches are easily caught in a quandary among accuracy, efficiency, and scope of applicability. This paper presents a dual-level surrogate structure (DLSS) for dealing with the IPEF calculation of an integrated energy system (IES) in an accurate and efficient manner. The structure accommodates electricity, heat, and gas, attaining a high-level balance among precision, speed, and range of applicability. At the lower level of DLSS, a sparse polynomial chaos expansion (sPCE) model is employed to directly map random input variables to output boundary values, saving massive repetition of deterministic calculation. At the upper level of DLSS, a heterogeneous-learning-based multiple energy flow (HL-MEF) model is proposed to accelerate the indispensable deterministic MEF calculation for online sampling, thereby easing the computational burden of sPCE training. Finally, numerical results on a real-world electricity-heat-gas system demonstrate that the proposed DLSS can solve the IPEF problem at nearly 400 times the speed of the standard double-layer Monte Carlo simulation (DLMCS) with guaranteed accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Collaborative Scheduling of Port Integrated Energy and Container Logistics Considering Electric and Hydrogen-Powered Transport</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10100958</link><description>To improve energy efficiency and reduce pollution emissions of ports with electricity and hydrogen substitution, this paper proposes a collaborative scheduling method of port integrated energy and container logistics considering electric and hydrogen-powered transport. By analyzing the coupling relationship between energy production and consumption in a port that deploys electric and hydrogen-powered transport, the scheduling optimization models of the port integrated energy system (PIES) and the port container logistic system (PCLS) are collaboratively established and rendered as a mixed-integer bi-level programming model. Moreover, to simplify the complexity of PCLS scheduling which involves the allocation and operation of each type of container logistics equipment, an assembly line of port container logistics (ALPCL) model based on flexible job-shop scheduling (FJSS) is further constructed. Then, a distributed algorithm based on the Benders decomposition (BD) embedded with an improved non-dominated sorting genetic (INSGA-II) is designed to realize optimal dispatch with limited data exchange and great solution efficiency. The results of case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for economic and environmental benefits, including a reduction in scheduling costs and pollution emissions. This method can also achieve co-improvement of energy and logistics efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Residential Energy Scheduling Under Time-of-Use and Demand Charge Tariffs With Federated Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10057441</link><description>In this paper, we study multi-residential energy scheduling to minimize total energy costs while satisfying energy demands, where each residence has an energy management system (EMS) that equips energy storage and renewable energy sources and is connected to on-grid energy sources with time-of-use (TOU) and demand charge (DC) tariffs. To this end, we first develop a novel TOU and DC-aware energy scheduling (TDAS) algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (RL). It learns the policy for a single EMS which optimally determines the amount of on-grid energy consumption considering its stored energy, system uncertainties, and both tariffs without requiring any a priori information about the uncertainties. Based on the TDAS algorithm, we develop a cooperative multi-residential TDAS (Co-TDAS) algorithm using federated RL. In the algorithm, each EMS cooperatively learns a central policy that can be used for any EMS with diverse environments and utilizes it distributedly. Through simulations with real datasets, we demonstrate that our TDAS algorithm achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines with perfect a priori information. Moreover, it outperforms the baselines even with small errors on the information. We also show that the Co-TDAS algorithm learns the policy that can be utilized in different EMSs, even in newly arrived ones, and accelerates its learning speed via cooperative learning.</description></item><item><title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Explainable Pricing Policy for Virtual Storage Rental Service</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10068282</link><description>The shared community energy storage system (CESS) can reduce energy storage costs by exploiting the complementarity of end-users and economies of scale. To further improve the economic feasibility of the CESS, we propose a novel business model and pricing method for the virtual storage rental service (VSRS). In this model, the rental users aim to minimize the electricity bill by renting the virtual capacity and optimizing its operation, while the CESS operator seeks to maximize the revenue from the combination of energy arbitrage and the VSRS. The pricing problem and the optimal operation problems of the CESS and users&#8217; virtual batteries are modeled as a bi-level optimization problem. Next, the proposed problem is solved through transformer-based deep deterministic policy gradient (TDDPG) method and mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) due to the non-convexity and non-continuity of the original problem. The post-hoc interpretability of the policy network is provided based on the Shapley value to reveal the importance of different input features for decision-making. Numerical simulations suggest that the proposed VSRS could benefit the CESS operator and users. Moreover, the explanation based on the Shapley value could effectively generate an implicit solution for understanding the policy network.</description></item><item><title>Graph Deep-Learning-Based Retail Dynamic Pricing for Demand Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10075481</link><description>Designing customized dynamic pricing is a promising way to incent consumers to adjust their daily energy consumption behaviors. It helps manage flexible demand response resources on peak load. However, it is insufficiently investigated in previous studies from the individual behavior perspective. To tackle the gap, this paper proposes a graph deep learning-based retail dynamic pricing mechanism. First, a graph attention network-based temporal price elasticity perceptron model is proposed. It explores a novel path to learn price elasticity by using graph deep learning, and can accurately assess consumers&#8217; energy consumption behaviors under different prices. Then, to avoid unfair evaluation of demand response, two indexes are proposed as auxiliary measures to assess energy consumption behavior learning models. At last, a customized dynamic pricing model based on the temporal price elasticity perceptron model is proposed. It can develop consumer&#8217;s time-varying demand response potential. This potential is first defined in this paper to measure what potentials of shifting/curtailing energy during a period a consumer has. By the pricing, the consumer could be incented to engage in demand response. The numerical studies validate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed methods, meanwhile price risks from the price change can be hedged effectively.</description></item><item><title>On the Sample Complexity of Storage Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10090474</link><description>Understanding the data value for energy-storage control is critical. The performance of the control policy is highly related to the quality of demand information. An accurate prediction about future demand can better the performance of energy storage control. Thus, the storage control asks for sufficient data-sample collection for qualified prediction. However, there lacks of a theory to quantify the data sufficiency for the energy-storage control problem. Meanwhile, demand data samples include privacy information while the storage managers have to procure the data from data owners. Thus, it is necessary to determine the relationship between the data size and the storage-control performance. In addition, a growing number of studies have proposed many storage-control policies. However, we are unknown how to theoretically verify their data-use efficiency. Here, we develop the sample complexity theory of storage-control problem, which enables us to theoretically measure the data-use efficiency of the control strategy and assess the data value. We proposed the sample-based dynamic programming (SDP) algorithm that is both cost-minimization and data-use efficient. Based on the SDP and the sample complexity theory, we manifest the trade-off between data size, computational load, and storage-control performances. Finally, we used real-world data to conduct numerical experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving and Hierarchically Federated Framework for Short-Term Residential Load Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122655</link><description>Short-term Load Forecasting (STLF) plays a fundamental role in modern energy systems. This paper proposes a privacy-preserving STLF framework for residential energy users. The framework enables users to collaboratively train an STLF model without exchanging their load data. The system works in two stages: (i) a federated user clustering method is developed to divide the users into multiple clusters based on load pattern similarity. Instead of aggregating the users&#8217; data to do clustering, the developed method determines the user clusters in a distributed manner. (ii) after the user clustering stage, a hierarchically federated STLF model training is developed, which applies federated learning principles to facilitate intra- and inter-user cluster model training. In the process, the individual users also do not expose their load data. Further, an asynchronous communication mechanism is designed and integrated into the framework, making it high fault-tolerant and adaptable to the residential environment with communication uncertainties. Comprehensive experiments based on a real Australian load dataset are conducted to validate the system. The simulation results show that the proposed framework can effectively train the load forecasting model with a fast coverage rate and achieve up to 37.25% prediction accuracy improvement (in terms of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error metric) compared with the other benchmark methods.</description></item><item><title>Reliant Monotonic Charging Controllers for Parallel-Connected Battery Storage Units to Reduce PV Power Ramp Rate and Battery Aging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10057008</link><description>The inherited intermittency of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems impacts the power grid by creating power fluctuations, which are mitigated by the integration of battery energy storage systems (BESS) augmented with a smoothing controller. However, the conventional charging and discharging schemes result in a repetitive and chaotic state of charge (SOC) which might degrade the BESS performance. This paper proposes a reliant monotonic charging/discharging controller (RMCC) to reduce battery degradation while maintaining smoothing efficiency. In this configuration, two battery units operate concurrently, one charging, and the other discharging, which helps to reduce battery cycles and extend BESS lifetime. In addition, the paper presents a smart RMCC (S-RMCC) controller to control the operation of a BESS made up of an even number of battery units greater than two. The controller forecasts the short-term irradiance and identifies the existence of power ramps using a ramp event detector. Hence, the forecasted irradiance is then utilized to obtain the PV output power and to compute the forecasted needed charging and discharging energy to compensate for PV power intermittency. These estimates are then compared to the remaining energy of battery units to determine whether to work with the entire BESS system or a subset of units. The proposed controllers were tested for battery degradation, ramp rate reduction, and power smoothing efficiency. The battery degradation is significantly minimal when using RMCC-operated units, accounting for 0.1877% and 0.1918%, as compared to 9.1514% when using a single BESS for smoothing.</description></item><item><title>Energy Optimization Management Strategy for DC Nano-Grid Cluster With High Comprehensive Energy Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10058743</link><description>Nano-grid (NG) clusters (NGCs) have the potential to serve as an essential configuration for future low-voltage distribution networks. To address the comprehensive energy efficiency (CEE) problem over a longer time horizon, this paper proposes an energy optimization management strategy. First of all, three typical models are developed, namely equivalent circuit model, cluster loss model and energy sharing model. In the modelling, influences of port characteristics and power transmission losses of interconnecting converters are considered to more accurately describe the cluster power flow. Then, an optimal energy scheduling mechanism with high CEE is proposed based on the three established models. The strategy decomposes the complex CEE problem into three interdependent sub-problems, corresponding to the three established models. First, ensuring the bus power quality and battery requirements are satisfied based on the proposed equivalent circuit model. Second, improving cluster self-sufficiency based on cluster energy sharing model. Third, achieving high energy transfer efficiency based on cluster loss model. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the CEE under the proposed strategy achieves significant performance improvements, with increases of 8% and 32% in energy transfer efficiency and energy self-sufficiency respectively.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability of Paralleled Virtual Synchronous Generator and Grid-Following Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10064337</link><description>The majority of inverter-based resources (IBRs) currently operate as grid-following inverters (GFLIs). However, these inverters exhibit certain stability issues when integrated in low-strength areas of the grid. To enhance the grid strength in a GFLI-dominant area, virtual synchronous generators (VSGs) can be installed. If the VSG and the GFLI are investigated as a paralleled system, despite the benefits brought by the VSG, in some cases, the transient angle instability process, caused by a voltage sag, is accelerated, making the whole system more prone to instability. Therefore, this paper aims to study the transient angle stability of a paralleled VSG-GFLI system via investigating the voltage at a common bus between the two IBRs. Subsequently, a stable region of the voltage angles of the two IBRs is determined. Based on this stable region, the stability margin of the paralleled system can be determined and used to quantitatively evaluate the system stability. Moreover, an additional control loop is proposed to improve the transient stability of the paralleled system in this paper. The proposed controller can adaptively reduce the power set-point of the VSG to avoid a complete failure of the VSG even when no stable equilibrium point exists during a voltage sag. The stability investigation and performance evaluation of the proposed method are conducted in PSCAD/EMTDC and experimentally validated.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Cooperative Event-Triggered Control of Cyber-Physical AC Microgrids Subject to Denial-of-Service Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10077801</link><description>This paper addresses the event-triggered distributed cooperative secure secondary control for islanded cyber-physical inverter-based ac microgrids (MGs) under the energy-limited denial of service (DoS) attacks. The DoS attack refers to the prevention of information exchange among Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in the secondary control level. In this paper, an event-triggered mechanism (ETM) is employed to improve communication efficiency and reduce control command updates. Based on the last successful local and neighboring transmission attempt, an estimator is proposed which is only activated over attack periods. In addition, this study investigates the contribution of both DERs and Distributed Energy Storage Systems (DESS) in ac MGs. Finally, the performance of the proposed control scheme is evaluated by an offline digital time-domain simulation on a test MG system through different scenarios in MATLAB/Simulink environment. Also, the effectiveness and accuracy of the controller are verified by comparison with several previous studies.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Performance of Andronov-Hopf Oscillator-Based Grid-Forming Converters in Microgrids With Non-Invasive Online Impedance Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10078326</link><description>The Andronov-Hopf based Virtual Oscillator Control (AHO) is an emerging control strategy for grid-forming converters (GFC) to ensure the stability of the future power system with high level of penetration of renewable energies. AHO allows converters to operate in either grid-connected and islanded operating modes. However, the application of this control strategy is limited due to the inherent problem in simultaneous controlling active and reactive power output of GFCs. This paper presents a modification in AHO control structure, and adopts a wide-band grid impedance estimation to improve the dispatchability of AHO in grid-connected mode. The impedance estimation algorithm is embedded into the control loop of AHO, and requires only the measurement of the voltages and currents at the point of common coupling. Thus it is cost-effective and practical. The performance of the proposed method is validated in both simple-structure, and large low-voltage benchmark distribution systems, using MATLAB/Simulink software and the real-time Opal-RT platform. The simulation results confirm the high-accuracy of the estimation and the capability of AHO in simultaneously controlling active and reactive power with zero steady-state errors. Additionally, this paper discusses the small-signal stability and Lyapunov large signal stability of the proposed AHO and compares it to existing methods.</description></item><item><title>An Auto-Tuned Robust Dispatch Strategy for Virtual Power Plants to Provide Multi-Stage Real-Time Balancing Service</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10097549</link><description>To fully exploit the flexible potential of distributed energy resources (DERs) in providing balancing service to the power system, Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) act as control centers to conduct the optimal real-time dispatch of their managed DERs. This study investigates a VPP&#8217;s auto-tuned robust policy based on a multi-stage distributionally robust optimization model (DRO) in response to the uncertainties from both the setpoint of the top-level system operator (SO) and the outputs of renewable DERs. We propose a concise paradigm to reduce the complexity of the original large-scale optimization task. Specifically, we first cast the multi-stage DRO problem into a dynamic programming (DP) formulation and further simplify it to derive a single-stage convex optimization control policy (COCP) at each time stage. Further, an automatic update method based on implicit differentiation is employed to tune the parameters of COCP. Case studies show that this method ensures higher solution quality and faster convergence during training than conventional tuning methods. The proposed COCP outperforms other stochastic optimization techniques in terms of robustness, efficiency, and computational speed.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Hierarchical Energy Flexibility Management of Integrated Hybrid Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227086</link><description>This paper proposes a novel real-time hierarchical energy flexibility management model for integrated hybrid resources (IHRs) in power distribution systems. In the proposed model, each IHR is a combination of different distributed energy resources (DERs) and electric vehicle (EV) chargers that are controlled and dispatched as a single resource in power distribution system. The proposed hierarchical model utilizes a reinforcement learning model, deep deterministic policy gradient, in the IHR controller to dispatch DERs and EVs locally, while a central controller ensures the feasibility and deliverability of the dispatched solution. More specifically, the IHR controller determines the energy dispatches and sends the required net active power as well as the upper and lower boundaries of net reactive power of the IHR to the central controller. The central controller performs power flow analysis and adjusts the received net active power and determines the net reactive power dispatch of each IHR. The proposed model is implemented on IEEE 123-bus test power distribution system with different penetration of DERs and EVs. The simulation results showcase the efficacy of the proposed model in capturing the energy flexibility of DERs and EVs to reduce the operation cost of power distribution system. Further, the robustness and computational efficiency of the proposed model compared to optimization model in dispatching DERs and EVs while meeting the power distribution system constraints is highlighted.</description></item><item><title>Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring Method for Multi-Energy Coupling Appliances Considering Spatio-Temporal Coupling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10054431</link><description>The multi-energy coupling (MEC) appliances couple electricity, gas, heat, and cold, of which the gas, heat, and cold have long transient processes. However, these transient features have never been considered in past non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) methods. This paper proposes a novel NILM method for MEC appliances considering spatio-temporal coupling, which combines semi-supervised learning and weakly supervised learning. Firstly, the unlabeled historical events are labeled by graph-based semi-supervised learning (GBSSL) and distinguished into three categories, i.e., reliable, uncertain, and unreliable samples. Then, to fully use of spatio-temporal coupling information, the unreliable samples are discarded and the feature vectors of other samples are expanded into spatio-temporal coupling feature vectors. To improve the accuracy of load identification, this paper proposes a two-stage deep learning framework &#8220;Teaching and Mutual Learning&#8221; (TML). In the teaching stage, two convolutional neural networks (CNN) are pre-trained with reliable samples. In the mutual learning stage, the noise samples are filtered by using the different learning abilities of the two networks. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are verified on five types of MEC appliances in a park IES.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Auto-Clustering for Residential Load Profiling Using AMI Data From the U.S. High Plains</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10063983</link><description>Managing demand and building customized services are essential for power retailers, distribution network operators (DNOs), and load-serving entities (LSEs) in a competitive retail environment. Therefore, understanding residential customer power demand behaviors is essential for accurate load profiling. However, the large volume of fine-grained smart meter data and the wide variety of residential behavior make load profile extraction extremely challenging, even further exacerbated by deterministic clustering&#8217;s inherent limitations. This paper develops a distributed auto-clustering approach (DAA) for load profiling using real smart meter data based on a divide-and-conquer scheme to tackle current load profiling challenges. To improve the load profiling accuracy, temperature-based categories (TBCs) are proposed to distinguish days with similar temperatures. A Heterogeneous Distributed Local Sites (HDLS) scheme is developed based on the raster map concept to distribute smart meter data among local sites while considering their size and density. Local sites send the load representatives to a central site for global clustering to significantly reduce clustering complexity and computational burden.

However, most cutting-edge NILM models have a critical assumption that switching events are triggered by known appliances in the training set, which may be unrealistic. In reality, new appliances are constantly being added, reducing the effectiveness of current methods for load monitoring. In this paper, we propose a conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) to correctly classify all the known appliances while simultaneously detecting unknown ones using the V-I trajectory features. We integrate variational autoencoder and capsule networks in the generator network, the capsule features of the same known appliance class are forced to match a pre-defined Gaussian and a group of Gaussian priors (one for each appliance class) as the posterior distribution approximately. Furthermore, using an additional encoder network maps the generated V-I trajectory to its latent representation, minimizing the distance between the latent representations and the feature vectors of the generator aids in learning the data distribution for known appliance samples during the training process. In these ways, we can improve the ability of the model to detect unknown appliances. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.</description></item><item><title>Co-Optimizing Bidding and Power Allocation of an EV Aggregator Providing Real-Time Frequency Regulation Service</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10059168</link><description>The rapidly expanding scale of electric vehicle (EV) fleets and continuously decreasing battery costs are making vehicle-to-grid services a reality. In this paper, we study the interaction between the problems of an EV aggregator&#8217;s bidding in the regulation market and power allocation (i.e., determining the (dis)charging powers of the EVs in regulation deployment). Although the two problems are coupled, they are often regarded as decoupled and optimized separately for complexity issues. However, failing to consider the coupling of bidding and power allocation can lead to a decline in the profit of the EV aggregator (EVA). In this paper, we propose a framework for co-optimizing EVA bidding and power allocation in the regulation market. The bidding model is formulated as a stochastic programming problem with embedded power allocation in discretized regulation signal scenarios. To meet the solution time requirement for regulation deployment, we further propose a power allocation model that can be solved online. It utilizes the Lagrange multipliers from the bidding problem to ensure that the allocation results correspond to the optimal solution of the bidding problem. The effect of the proposed framework on improving EVA profits and reducing degradation costs is verified in the case study.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Optimization of Emergency Response Resources in Transportation-Power Distribution Networks Under Extreme Events</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10068816</link><description>The proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) and the increasing interdependence across power distribution networks (DNs) and transportation networks (TNs) have increased the complexity and vulnerability of the two systems in extreme circumstances. As the interdependence of two infrastructures tightens over time, it is viewed as a dire necessity to strengthen the resilience of the coordinated transportation-power distribution networks (TDNs) against natural disasters. This paper constructs a coordinated optimization method of TN traffic link reversing, DN line switching, and fast charging pile management, to improve the TDN performance in the emergency response stage after disasters. A dynamic TN model and a multi-period DN model are integrated in TDN modeling to capture flow propagations and state variations among time intervals. The coordinated optimization for TDN emergency response is designed as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem with high-order objective functions and nonlinear constraints to minimize TN travel costs and DN active and reactive power shortages. An accuracy-aware adaptive piecewise linearization approach combined with Gray code-based encoding is utilized to improve the computational efficiency for solving the TDN optimization problem. Numerical simulations show that the TDN performance is enhanced by coordinating various DN and TN resources, as compared with those of separate and conventional topology controls. The proposed TDN solution method has significantly reduced the computation time for managing extreme conditions while guaranteeing the accuracy of the results as compared with those of the nonlinear model and the linearized model by uniform piecewise linearization.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Model Predictive Control for Smart Electric Vehicle Charging Station With V2G/V2V Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10089877</link><description>This paper proposes a distributionally robust model predictive control (DRMPC) for energy management of a vehicle-to-grid (V2G)/vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V)-enabled smart electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) with a photovoltaic (PV) system and an energy storage system. The proposed DRMPC method aims to reduce the operational cost of the EVCS while ensuring the desired charging demands of electric vehicle (EV) users under uncertainties in electricity buying/selling prices, PV generation outputs, and future EV charging demands. To cope with these uncertainties, the proposed method includes the following three features: i) tractable reformulation of the worst-case expected buying cost and selling revenue using a Wasserstein metric and duality theory, ii) determination of a distributionally robust bound on the random PV generation output using its support information, and iii) a scenario-based approach to predicting the future EV charging demand. To improve computational efficiency, a penalty method is proposed to relax the complementarity constraints, while still ensuring nonsimultaneous charging and discharging of EVs under the derived sufficient conditions. Numerical examples using a real-world operational dataset of the EVCS are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DRMPC method under uncertain environments in terms of the EVCS cost saving via V2G/V2V capability, data utilization, and computational complexity.</description></item><item><title>A Mutually Beneficial Operation Framework for Virtual Power Plants and Electric Vehicle Charging Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10121507</link><description>Virtual power plants (VPPs) and electric vehicle (EV) charging stations (CSs) have been attracting much attention in recent years. However, existing research rarely concerns the cooperation between VPPs and CSs that are managed by different stakeholders. To facilitate the cooperation between VPPs and CSs, this work proposes a cooperative operation framework for a multi-stakeholder VPP-CSs system. In the proposed cooperative framework, day-ahead offering and real-time balancing models are developed to maximize the total benefit of the VPP-CSs system. To support a more flexible operation of the VPP-CSs system with EV energy flexibility, an EV user incentive program is proposed for acquiring EV battery access rights. The conflicting interests of different stakeholders are addressed by a  $\tau $ -value cost allocation method. To alleviate the computational burden in calculating the  $\tau $ -values, a maximum right cost estimation approach is proposed. Case studies confirm that the proposed methods can provide superior performance by increasing 4.6% of VPP profit, increasing 20.7% of CS profit, reducing 16.3% of EV user charging fees, and achieving 99.2% of  $\tau $ -value estimation accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Hybrid Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading Among Multiple Heterogeneous Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10056418</link><description>Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading among multi-microgrids has emerged as a promising paradigm to facilitate more efficient supply-demand balancing within local areas. However, existing works still exhibit limitations in terms of trading architecture and pricing schemes. In addition, the existing multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) methods suffer from computational overload caused by the exploration of joint and hybrid action space during centralized training. In this paper, we propose a P2P energy trading paradigm based on hierarchical hybrid MADRL to maximize the trading profits among multiple heterogeneous MGs. First, we design a novel hierarchical structure of the MC agent to model the coupled interaction between flexible demands scheduling and autonomous quotation. Then, a P2P market that employs an improved mid-market rate (IMMR) pricing scheme is proposed to incentivize participation in local trading. Furthermore, to handle hybrid discrete-continuous action space and reduce computational complexity, we propose a hierarchical hybrid multi-agent double deep Q-network and deep deterministic policy gradient (hh-MADDQN-DDPG) algorithm to split the optimal policy learning-workload into a sequence of two sub-tasks. The DDQN for flexible demands scheduling and DDPG for energy trading. Numerical results of simulation I demonstrate that our hh-MADDQN-DDPG with IMMR increases 25% of the trading profits averaged over the baselines. Results of simulation II show that our hh-MADDQN-DDPG provides higher profits compared with the existing methods while maintaining better computational performance and scalability.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Coordination of Charging Stations With Shared Energy Storage in a Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10077802</link><description>Electric vehicle (EV) charging stations have experienced rapid growth, whose impacts on the power grid have become non-negligible. Though charging stations can install energy storage to reduce their impacts on the grid, the conventional &#8220;one charging station, one energy storage&#8221; method may be uneconomical due to the high upfront cost of energy storage. Shared energy storage can be a potential solution. However, effective management of charging stations with shared energy storage in a distribution network is challenging due to the complex coupling, competing interests, and information asymmetry between different agents. To address the aforementioned challenges, this paper first proposes an equilibrium model to characterize the interaction among charging stations, shared energy storage, and the distribution network. We prove that the equilibrium coincides with the centralized optimization result with trading prices equaling the value of dual variables at optimum. Then, to achieve the efficient equilibrium, a distributed coordination mechanism with a prediction and a correction step is developed to guide the behaviors of different agents with proof of convergence. Numerical experiments and comprehensive performance comparisons are conducted to validate the theoretical results and show the advantages of the proposed mechanism.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Assessment of Cyber-Physical Distribution System Using Multi-Dimensional Information Network Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10049159</link><description>In the smart grid era, power distribution system (PDS) has gradually become a cyber-physical system with distinctly different modes of operation and control. This paper proposes a reliability modeling and assessment method for a cyber-physical distribution system (CPDS). The proposed CPDS reliability analysis method considers a multi-dimensional network model for the distribution information system (DIS) which introduces the fault location, isolation, and supply restoration (FLISR) process as an interface between PDS and DIS. The proposed CPDS reliability analysis method establishes the multi-dimensional DIS network model by defining the composite multiple nodal attributes and the system transfer matrix, building the path search method based on the transfer matrix, and calculating the DIS network availability based on the Monte-Carlo simulation. The solution of the proposed CPDS reliability analysis method provides the expected load-point outage duration of CPDS and the PDS reliability indices. The CPDS reliability assessment results are presented and analyzed for the improved IEEE 33-bus system and the key influencing factors are identified and discussed.</description></item><item><title>Multiverse Recurrent Expansion With Multiple Repeats: A Representation Learning Algorithm for Electricity Theft Detection in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10056370</link><description>Electricity theft, known as &#8220;Non-Technical Loss&#8221; (NTL) is certainly one of the priorities of power distribution utilities. Indeed, NTL could lead to serious damage ranging from massive financial losses to loss of reputation resulting from poor power quality. With advances in metering infrastructure technologies, the availability of user data has fueled the emergence of data-driven methods in NTL detection. Among these methods, deep learning (DL) is an indisputable alternative to conventional human-centric approaches. Typically, modeling based on NTL data is subject to three main challenges, including (i) missing information; (ii) class imbalance; and (iii) data complexity. In this context, this paper contributes to solving these three main problems while paying more attention to data complexity related to cardinality. Accordingly, a multiverse recurrent expansion with multiple repeats (MV-REMR) algorithm is proposed in this paper. MV-REMR is able to provide deeper representations than ordinary DL networks and take advantage of different trained deep network responses to build an efficient model. For MV-REMR efficiency analysis, a realistic NTL dataset is considered. As a result, MV-REMR has shown that it can achieve what is considered excellent feature mapping proven by both scatter visualization and variations in widely used classification metrics. Moreover, MV-REMR shows its ability to marginalize the distance of data classes with superior performance. In addition, thanks to the new mapping scheme, MV-REMR shows its ability to correct outliers resulting from errors in missing values filling techniques. Finally, a comparison with some recent successful works also confirms the superiority of the MV-REMR model.</description></item><item><title>Chaotic Systems-Based Secure Communication Scheme for Detection of Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10057029</link><description>With the popularity of the Industrial Internet of Things, there are huge security challenges in the storage and transmission of image information. How to ensure that transmitted images from malicious attacks and random tampering have become a hot topic of information security. In this paper, a new secure communication scheme is proposed in consideration of the security requirements of transmitted images during the detection of wind turbines process. The scheme is based on the image diffusion method of chaotic systems. By utilizing the sensitivity of the chaotic systems to the initial conditions and parameters, and using the parameters as the key to realizing the encryption and decryption of the image. Furthermore, a large amount of image information will be acquired in real-time during the inspection process of the fan blades by UAVs. Due to the limited computing and storage resources of UAVs, C-E-D three-layer architecture is adopted, which can effectively offload the complex tasks to the edge and cloud to significantly reduce UAVs latency and energy consumption. Test and analysis results show that the proposed encryption scheme is effective and reliable for image security communication applications.</description></item><item><title>CASL: A Novel Collusion Attack Against Distributed Energy Management Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10057447</link><description>Recently, the security issues of smart grids have received wide attention. In particular, false data injection attacks against distributed energy management systems (DEMSs) are considered of high importance as they are able to cause economic losses or even damages to system stability in subtle ways. Existing studies have identified many such attacks and proposed corresponding countermeasures. However, in this paper, we show that DEMS is still insecure and in risk of economic loss by proposing and analyzing a novel attack called Collusion Attack between a Storage and a Load (CASL). In CASL, a distributed energy storage device colludes with a load by injecting an abnormal extra power supply to the load in a secret way through using two secret functions. In this way, the colluding pair behaves as normal ones in both computational and communicational viewpoints. We theoretically prove the convergence of DEMS in presence of the attack, and derive an upper bound of the social welfare losses of DEMS caused by CASL. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CASL through simulations.</description></item><item><title>Model-Measurement Data Integrity Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10061581</link><description>The vulnerabilities of information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures leave room for cyber attacks threatening the reliable operations of power systems. Based on the real-world evidence of the Ukraine power grid attack and the popular technical discussion that cyber attacks could be launched at the control-center level, this paper reveals a new attack strategy: model-measurement data integrity (MMI) attack. Instead of compromising measurements only, we investigate the possibility where network parameters are coordinately manipulated when constructing false data injection attack (FDIA) vectors. Furthermore, we model cyber adversaries&#8217; possible behavior of co-planning the manipulated measurement channels and parameter attack vectors prior to the launch of FDIAs. The revealed MMI attack strategy allows a drastic reduction of measurement channels to compromise in run-time for keeping the stealth property. Simulations in the IEEE 14-bus test system and the IEEE 118-bus test system demonstrate the feasibility of the revealed MMI attack strategy.</description></item><item><title>The Cost and Benefit of Enhancing Cybersecurity for Hybrid AC/DC Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10065593</link><description>As critical interfaces of AC grids and DC grids inside a hybrid AC/DC grid, the voltage-sourced-converter (VSC) has been demonstrated to be vulnerable to false data injection (FDI) cyber-attacks. As a result, the cyber-attack-induced AC grid frequency deviations and DC grid voltage deviations threaten the secure operation. To enhance cybersecurity in a not only feasible but also cost-effective manner, this paper proposes a cost-benefit-based cyber-defense strategy for a hybrid AC/DC grid. First, this paper establishes a spatial-temporal dual cyber-attack evaluation model, in which the cyber-attack-induced frequency and voltage deviations are modelled in both a spatially and temporally dual manner. Then, the proposed cost-benefit-based cyber-defense strategy is modelled as a VSC commitment problem to achieve the trade-off between maximizing the cyber-defense benefits and minimizing the cyber-defense costs. The VSC commitment problem is then mathematically convexified into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) problem, which could be efficiently solved in an event-triggered manner against unfolding cyber-attack events. Simulation results on a test hybrid AC/DC grid verified the feasibility and the cost-effectiveness of the proposed cyber-defense strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Deep Learning-Based Attack Detection Mechanism Against Potential Cascading Failure Induced by Load Redistribution Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10068794</link><description>The occurrence of load redistribution (LR) attacks has disastrous consequences for the power system, but these attacks have a significant impact when they cause cascading failures in the system. The mechanisms and strategies for detecting and designing LR attacks resulting in overflow on lines have been the focus of different studies. But fewer studies have been done to detect LR attacks that cause cascading failures. This paper presents a mechanism for identifying LR attacks that, besides causing overflow on lines, have the potential to generate cascading failure. A novel LR attack scheme with cascading failure potential is first proposed for this purpose. The detection mechanism has a basic exploitable structure based on analyzing the estimated cyber load data through the energy management system and a deep learning network. The performance evaluation of the detection mechanism is implemented with regard to the IEEE standard 118-bus system. Various attack scenarios under different conditions (topologies, target lines, and attack load level variations  $(\alpha)$ ) are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The results clearly show an acceptable level of accuracy for the proposed mechanism, which can distinguish between LR attacks via the overload purpose while also showing the system&#8217;s secure state.</description></item><item><title>An Underestimated Cybersecurity Problem: Quick-Impact Time Synchronization Attacks and a Fast-Triggered Detection Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10076910</link><description>For cybersecurity concerns in smart girds, this paper has focused on the vulnerability analysis and defense technique against the Time Synchronization Attack (TSA). This kind of attack can spoof satellite-signal-based time synchronization processes that are widely utilized in modern power systems. A quick-impact TSA experiment is presented in this paper, based on live satellite signals and a commercial time server used in current smart grids. Experiment results are alarming. Intolerable timing errors have been imposed on the server within a few tens of seconds, and it hasn&#8217;t reported any alarms. So a new cybersecurity concern for distributed power systems is revealed: stealthy TSAs must be detected at the early stage due to their quick impacts, yet current studies have underestimated this problem. In response to this potential threat, a fast-triggered detection method is proposed in this paper. It is named the Rapid Detection of Signal Distortions (RDSD) and can detect early stage signal distortions caused by TSAs at the beginning. Apart from this ability, we have also verified, via simulations and real-world comparative experiments, that the proposed method can provide improved detection and false alarm rejection capacity compared with existing methods of this type. Overall, this paper can raise attention to the cybersecurity problem caused by TSAs and facilitate the defense against them in modern smart grids.</description></item><item><title>A Storage-Based Fixed-Time Frequency Synchronization Method for Improving Transient Stability and Resilience of Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10077768</link><description>A storage-based distributed fixed-time frequency synchronization method is developed to enhance the frequency and transient stability of smart grid. The multi-agent cyber-physical model of power system is the foundation of the proposed control method which utilizes data on the relative angle and frequency between the local agent and its neighbor agents. The control method mainly consists of frequency control based on energy storage system (ESS), P- $\omega $  droop control of synchronous generator (SG), and P- $\theta $  droop control of converter-based generator (CBG), which is designed by the backstepping method and Lyapunov theory. In addition, to hasten frequency synchronization, the nonlinear voltage control which is compatible with frequency control is presented. Meanwhile, the control method is not only applied to the homogeneous power systems only include SGs, but also deals with the challenge of heterogeneous bus dynamics introduced by the coexistence of SGs and CBGs. The distributed fixed-time frequency control can achieve self-protecting from denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by transforming into decentralized control. Comparative simulations show that the designed storage-based frequency synchronization method is preferable in improving the transient stability and resilience of smart grid.</description></item><item><title>Switched Observer-Based Adaptive Event-Triggered Load Frequency Control for Networked Power Systems Under Aperiodic DoS Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10078278</link><description>This paper is concerned with a resilient load frequency control (LFC) problem for networked power systems against the aperiodic denial-of-service (DoS) attack. First, considering the intermittent nature of the aperiodic DoS attack and the unavailability of the partial system states simultaneously, a switched observer-based time-delay networked power model is established. Second, to save network bandwidth resources, a novel adaptive event-triggering mechanism is designed by applying a switch-adjusting threshold parameter scheme. Then, a switched observer-based PI controller is designed and a piecewise Lyapunov functional analysis approach is developed such that the exponential stability of closed-loop augmented power systems is derived with desired  $H_{\infty }$  performance in forms of linear matrix inequality (LMI). Finally, a power system example with IEEE 39-bus is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the designed schemes.</description></item><item><title>Localizing False Data Injection Attacks in Smart Grid: A Spectrum-Based Neural Network Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10081329</link><description>Smart grid is confronted with cyberattacks due to the increasing dependence on cyberspace. False data injection attacks (FDIAs) represent a major type of cyberattacks that cannot be detected by the traditional bad data detection (BDD). The majority of existing researches focus on how to detect FDIAs, while little attention has been paid to obtaining the exact attack locations, which are crucial for deploying countermeasures in time. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based approach for online localizing FDIAs in AC power systems. The approach transforms the multi-dimensional time series measurements to their time-frequency and spectral graph representations, to jointly capture the temporal and spatial correlations in the spectral domain. The spectral decomposition could better characterize the latent properties of measurements, such as auto-correlations of a bus and key dependency between buses, which would be poorly represented in the time domain and vertex domain. Specifically, the proposed approach first adopts the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and a two-channel convolutional neural network (2C-CNN) to model the spectral-temporal correlations. Then the spectral-spatial relationships are modeled with a graph convolutional network (GCN), which combines the nodal admittance matrix and physical property of power systems. The prior physical knowledge further improves our approach&#8217;s interpretability and localization performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach with comprehensive case studies on various standard test systems. Numerical results indicate the superiority of our approach over baselines.</description></item><item><title>Destabilizing Attack and Robust Defense for Inverter-Based Microgrids by Adversarial Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10089185</link><description>The controllers of inverter-based resources (IBRs) can be adjustable by grid operators to facilitate regulation services. Considering the increasing integration of IBRs at power distribution level systems like microgrids, cyber security is becoming a major concern. This paper investigates the data-driven destabilizing attack and robust defense strategy based on adversarial deep reinforcement learning for inverter-based microgrids. Firstly, the full-order high-fidelity model and reduced-order small-signal model of typical inverter-based microgrids are recapitulated. Then the destabilizing attack on the droop control gains is analyzed, which reveals its impact on system small-signal stability. Finally, the attack and defense problems are formulated as Markov decision process (MDP) and adversarial MDP (AMDP). The problems are solved by twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm to find the least effort attack path of the system and obtain the corresponding robust defense strategy. The simulation studies are conducted in an inverter-based microgrid system with 4 IBRs and IEEE 123-bus system with 10 IBRs to evaluate the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Reevaluating Contour Visualizations for Power Systems Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10058599</link><description>Effective visual analytics tools are needed now more than ever as emerging energy systems data and models are rapidly growing in scale and complexity. We examined the suitability of colored contour maps to visually represent bus values in two different power system models: a dense 24k-bus distribution system and a 240-bus transmission system. In a quantitative analysis, we found that contour maps misrepresent power systems data, changing the statistical dispersion of the bus values, including the loss of extreme values. In a controlled empirical study with thirty professional power system research engineers, we found that these distortions significantly impact excursion identification tasks. Additionally, the engineers were less confident in their assessments using contour-based visualizations than glyph-based visualizations.</description></item><item><title>Personalized Federated DARTS for Electricity Load Forecasting of Individual Buildings</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10063999</link><description>Building-level load forecasting is becoming increasingly crucial since it forms the foundation for better building energy management, which will lower energy consumption and reduce CO2 emissions. However, building-level load forecasting faces the challenges of high load volatility and heterogeneous consumption behaviors. Simple regression models may fail to fit the complex load curves, whereas sophisticated models are prone to overfitting due to the limited data of an individual building. To this end, we develop a novel forecasting model that integrates federated learning (FL), the differentiable architecture search (DARTS) technique, and a two-stage personalization approach. Specifically, buildings are first grouped according to the model architectures, and for each building cluster, a global model is designed and trained in a federated manner. Then, a local fine-tuning approach is used to adapt the cluster global model to each individual building. In this way, data resources from multiple buildings can be utilized to construct high-performance forecasting models while protecting each building&#8217;s data privacy. Furthermore, personalized models with specific architectures can be trained for heterogeneous buildings. Extensive experiments on a publicly available dataset are conducted to validate the superiority of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Density Forecasting of Low-Voltage Load Using Bernstein-Polynomial Normalizing Flows</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10066318</link><description>The transition to a fully renewable energy grid requires better forecasting of demand at the low-voltage level to increase efficiency and ensure reliable control. However, high fluctuations and increasing electrification cause huge forecast variability, not reflected in traditional point estimates. Probabilistic load forecasts take uncertainties into account and thus allow more informed decision-making for the planning and operation of low-carbon energy systems. We propose an approach for flexible conditional density forecasting of short-term load based on Bernstein polynomial normalizing flows, where a neural network controls the parameters of the flow. In an empirical study with 3639 smart meter customers, our density predictions for 24h-ahead load forecasting compare favorably against Gaussian and Gaussian mixture densities. Furthermore, they outperform a non-parametric approach based on the pinball loss, especially in low-data scenarios.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Energy Management Method for Networked Multi-Energy Microgrids Based on Improved DQN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10081276</link><description>The networked Multi-Energy Microgrids (MEMGs) can significantly improve the economic efficiency of operation through energy cooperation and complementarity. However, the complex energy trading mechanism and multi-energy coupling decision process present various challenges for the optimal operation of MEMGs, such as the large decision space and the difficulty of converging to the global optimal solution. This study presents a novel energy management method for MEMG based on an improved Deep  ${Q}$ -network (IDQN) to solve these problems. Firstly, the equivalent model of an external interactive environment is constructed for each MEMG by using a novel Kriging surrogate enhanced Gate Recurrent Unit-Temporal Convolutional Network (GRU-TCN), which requires only the accessible energy exchange data and the public and independent information as input. The computational complexity of the reinforcement learning reward function is reduced accordingly by using this equivalent model. Subsequently, an improved  ${k}$ -crossover sampling strategy with reduced access frequency of the low reward actions is proposed to replace the traditional  $\varepsilon $ -greedy strategy to further improve the original DQN. This effectively addresses the problem of inefficient exploration in a large-scale action space. Lastly, the proposed method is verified using a test system with three MEMGs. The result demonstrates that the proposed IDQN method presents better convergence and stability than the traditional DQN, and presents better energy management and operational efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Photovoltaic Installation Admittance Optimization: An End-to-End Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10092863</link><description>Distributed photovoltaic installation admittance capacity (PVAC) refers to the maximum capacity of photovoltaics that can be accommodated by the distribution system. The economic and reliable PVAC evaluation is critical for distributed photovoltaic capacity planning and configuration. However, lacking sufficient measurement devices and unachievable to full-scale perception of the practical distribution system impose challenges for PVAC assessment. This paper proposes an end-to-end approach to evaluate PVAC using the data from gird terminals and smart meters, where network topology and line parameters will be unnecessary. Specifically, an end-to-end power flow variables mapping model is proposed, which is essentially using the adaptive online deep learning algorithm to model and train the functional relationship of terminal active power, reactive power and voltage. Based on the above mapping relationship analysis, an end-user data driven photovoltaic installation admittance optimization model is established, which models the PVAC evaluation issue as a convex optimization model with differentiable objective function. Then a projected gradient descent algorithm based on adversarial attacks mechanism is proposed to solve the optimization model to obtain the maximum PVAC. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified on IEEE 33-node, IEEE 123-node and actual distribution systems.</description></item><item><title>Estimation Error Cost Optimization of Demand Side Management Based on Massive MIMO Communication Network in Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10076915</link><description>The estimation error cost (EEC) of smart grid under the demand side management is related to the network behavior and the accuracy of energy dispatch. In this paper, a communication and energy bidirectional link connection network (CEBCN) is proposed for decreasing the EEC of smart grid under demand side management. In the CEBCN, the network behavior is quantified to communication reliability and response validity. And the communication, implemented by massive multi-input-multi-output (MIMO), and energy dispatch can be realized, simultaneously. Also, the EEC is further decreased through a cost-priority based energy dispatch strategy proposed in this paper. Based on the CEBCN, the closed-form expressions are derived about the communication reliability and response validity. Naturally, the closed-form solution is derived for the EEC in the communication and energy transmission model, the results of which are used to investigate the EEC performance in smart grid. Numerical results validate that the reliability and validity of the proposed CEBCN and reveal the effect of various parameters on the EEC. Notably, the high EEC caused by communication instability can be reduced by at least 40% with the massive MIMO, and the cost-priority based energy dispatch strategy can further improve the EEC performance on communication infrastructure.</description></item><item><title>A GNN-Based Generative Model for Generating Synthetic Cyber-Physical Power System Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214388</link><description>Synthetic networks aim at generating realistic projections of real-world networks while concealing the actual system information.

In order to improve the efficiency of multi-lane heterogeneous on-ramp traffic composed of vehicles with different dynamic characteristics, we propose an eco-friendly on-ramp merging strategy for connected and automated vehicles in heterogeneous traffic. Firstly, the optimal lane decision method is proposed via the conditional proximal policy optimization algorithm to optimize the traffic flow of each lane and avoid local congestion in heterogeneous traffic. Then, considering travel time, energy consumption, and emission, the eco-friendly merging optimization problem is established to optimize vehicles&#8217; longitudinal velocity. According to the optimal lane and the optimal longitudinal velocity profile, the lateral end-point and longitudinal end-point of the local trajectory are solved for planning the local trajectory of the vehicles. Each vehicle tracks its local trajectory, realizing eco-friendly on-ramp merging. Compared with two existing ramp merging methods, results show that the proposed algorithm can mitigate local congestion effectively, and has superiority in traffic efficiency, energy economy, and eco-friendliness.</description></item><item><title>A Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Hierarchical Eco-Driving Strategy for Connected and Automated HEVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10147363</link><description>The advancement in vehicle connectivity and autonomy has fostered the development of eco-driving technology, aimed at optimizing driving behaviors to reduce vehicle energy consumption. This study proposed a real-time deep reinforcement learning based hierarchical eco-driving control strategy to optimally control a connected and automated hybrid electric vehicle in a traffic scenario with multiple constraints. The speed optimization layer of the proposed strategy employs a twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) based reference speed planning strategy to compute the optimized speed, based on a pre-trained optimal policy and observed environmental states. Specifically, to learn the optimal policy, a multi-objective reward function is designed that integrates fuel consumption reward and shaping reward involving car-following and road speed limit. Additionally, a rule-based competition-decision model is embedded within the speed optimization layer to ensure compliance with traffic light rules. In the vehicle controller layer, a real-time controller is implemented to specify appropriate actuator variables for the hybrid powertrain to track the reference speed and conduct energy management control. Simulation results show that the proposed TD3 based eco-driving strategy achieves remarkable energy saving performance by optimizing the speed. Besides, the proposed eco-driving strategy is capable of satisfying the constraint of diverse traffic scenarios, including car-following and traffic light, while also being computationally lightweight.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Stereo Image Depth Estimation Network With Group-Wise L1 Distance for Edge Devices Towards Autonomous Driving</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10146497</link><description>Depth estimation is an essential element to constitute 3D perceiving ability of autonomous vehicles. Real-time inference on power- or memory-constrained devices would expedite the progress of autonomous driving. In this paper, a lightweight stereo matching network is proposed to simultaneously achieve high accuracy and fast inference time. A novel feature extractor using patch embeddings for downsampling together with a peculiar pyramidal strategy is proposed to obtain accurate disparity maps with less computational resources. By constructing the cost volume with the proposed group-wise L1 distance, the measured feature similarity is represented faster and more efficiently compared to the group-wise correlation. A lightweight 3D aggregation network with less 3D convolutions is proposed to further improve the accuracy and inference time. In addition, TensorRT optimizer approach is employed to improve the inference speed of the model. Exhaustive experiments on KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015 datasets demonstrate that our model has the ability to execute in real-time on resource-constrained devices, achieving higher frame rates than contemporary state-of-the-art networks. Our pipeline can process 1232 &#215; 368 resolution images within the speed range of 33.8-73.5 frames per second on NVIDIA Jetson Nano with TensorRT optimization, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Rule-based decision-making methods provide a powerful solution with better interpretability. However, various hand-crafted rules may result in conflicts and poor scalability issues. To overcome this problem, this work proposes a hierarchical decision-making framework called State-Event-Condition-Action (SECA), which integrates the finite state machine and event-condition-action frameworks. This framework provides three products for system design: the SECA model&#8211;an abstract model of rules; the SECA state chart&#8211;a graphical visualization of rules; and the SECA rule description&#8211;a machine-readable format for practical deployment. The SECA framework offers several advantages, including convenient deployment, high efficiency, better logicality, and scalability. Simulation results demonstrate that the SECA framework enables autonomous decision-making in air confrontation scenarios and outperforms the event-condition-action framework in terms of computational time and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, the generalization test in robot navigation tasks verifies its potential applicability to other domains with different background knowledge.</description></item><item><title>Consistency Evaluation of Electric Vehicle Battery Pack: Multi-Feature Information Fusion Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10146428</link><description>The grouping and large-scale of battery energy storage systems lead to the problem of inconsistency. Practical consistency evaluation is significant for the management, equalization and maintenance of the battery system. Various evaluation methods have been developed over the past decades to better assess battery pack consistency. In these research efforts, the accuracy of the assessment results is often of paramount importance. In this work, a battery pack consistency evaluation approach is proposed based on multi-feature information fusion. Ohmic resistance, polarization resistance and open circuit voltage are identified as feature parameters from electric vehicle operation data. An adaptive forgetting factor recursive least squares (AFFRLS) algorithm is developed using fuzzy logic to modify the forgetting factor for parameter identification. Grey correlation analysis is applied to calculate the dispersion of features (DF). The DF is weighted to evaluate the inconsistency of the battery pack. Further, the weights are assigned through the CRITIC-G1 method. Moreover, a mapping model between the extracted voltage features and the DF is established through a cost-sensitive support vector machine (CS-SVM) algorithm, which is used to evaluate and predict the consistency distribution of battery parameters. Finally, the proposed algorithm is verified by experimental data. The results indicate that the proposed parameter identification, consistency evaluation and prediction methods have high accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Unleashing Grid Services Potential of Electric Vehicles for the Volt/VAR Optimization Problem</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10164236</link><description>Emerging utilization of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in Distribution Networks (DNs) decreases the power quality in the DN. The main quest of this research is to find out Can EVs and Photovoltaic (PV) systems support the DN and mitigate the voltage magnitude violations due to utilizing high penetration level EV? This article proposes a novel volt/VAR optimization (VVO) model by leveraging the reactive power support of EVs and PVs as Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) for the DN. The proposed VVO model contains the second-order conic relaxed form of the AC power flow equations. Thus, the presented VVO problem is a Mixed-Integer Second-Order Cone Programming (MISOCP) problem. To obtain the ability to support the DN, Smart Inverters (SIs) are utilized to connect EVs and PV systems to the DN. Thus, to add the PV and EV systems to the convexified form of the VVO problem, the P-Q characteristics and the model of SIs working at different operating points are presented based on experimental results. The proposed model of SIs allows the participation of DERs in the reactive power compensation to mitigate voltage issues of DN due to utilizing high penetration level EVs. Besides, the proposed model of SIs enables DERs to increase their dispatchability. The performance of the proposed model is examined in the case studies using the IEEE 33-bus system and the 123-bus system. It is illustrated in the case studies that the solar dispatchability increases by 12% when the proposed volt/VAR model is utilized for IEEE 33-bus system. Besides, it is illustrated in the case studies that the voltage profile of buses remains in the desired operating range when the proposed model is leveraged, even if the penetration level of EVs increased to 40%.</description></item><item><title>Charge Planning and Thermal Management of Battery Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10154172</link><description>This article studies optimal thermal management and charging of a battery electric vehicle driving over long-distance trips. The focus is on the potential benefits of including a heat pump in the thermal management system for waste heat recovery, and charging point planning, in a way to achieve optimality in time, energy, or their trade-off. An optimal control problem is formulated, in which the objective function includes the energy delivered by the charger(s), and the total charging time including the actual charging time and the detour time to and from the charging stop. To reduce the computational complexity, the formulated problem is then transformed into a hybrid dynamical system, where charging dynamics are modeled in the domain of normalized charging time. Driving dynamics can be modeled in either trip time or travel distance domains, as the vehicle speed is assumed to be known a priori, and the vehicle is only stopping at charging locations. Within the hybrid dynamical system, a binary variable is introduced for each charging location, in order to decide whether to use or skip a charger. This problem is solved numerically, and simulations are performed to evaluate the performance in terms of energy efficiency and time. The simulation results indicate that the time required for charging and total energy consumption are reduced up to $30.6 \,\% $ and $19.4 \,\% $, respectively, by applying the proposed algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Triangular DQ Tx Coils of Wireless EV Chargers for Large Misalignment Tolerances</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163911</link><description>Wireless charging of electric vehicles (EV) are inevitable for user convenience of EV charging when the EVs are parked in the charging stations. A new set of triangular DQ transmitting (Tx) coils for wireless EV chargers is newly proposed in this article for large longitudinal, lateral, and diagonal displacement tolerances. The proposed coil set consists of two layers, i.e., D-Tx and Q-Tx, where each Tx layer has two triangular coils of the same magnetic polarity diagonally, facing each other to generate a more uniform coupling coefficient between Tx and Rx w.r.t. the misalignments. In practice, diagonal misalignment tolerance is an important design criterion to deliver load power to EV because the worst scenario of misalignment is when longitudinal and lateral misalignments occur at the same time, i.e., diagonal misalignment. To solve these misalignment issues, the DQ transmitters were optimally designed to obtain uniformed output voltage against wide range of the diagonal misalignment situations. A prototype of an inductive power transfer (IPT) system having the proposed triangular DQ Tx coils for 3.5 kW wireless EV chargers was fabricated and experimentally verified with a switching frequency of 85 kHz, which can satisfy J2954 WPT1 class in the society of automotive engineers (SAE). As a result, it is found that 8.62 of the diagonal misalignment tolerance &#947;d has been achieved, and this value is superior to the other Tx coils.</description></item><item><title>Cognitive Radio-Inspired NOMA in Short-Packet Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10132579</link><description>Short-packet communication is an important feature of the Internet of Things (IoT). For allowing massive IoT devices to connect to a network through short packets, this paper designs a cognitive radio-inspired non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme, where the IoT users will not necessarily occupy an exclusive spectrum. To further improve the connections in an IoT network, we propose a general NOMA scheme that serves multiple IoT users. Since the IoT devices are generally homogeneous, a user fairness-oriented power allocation scheme is designed for the proposed NOMA scheme. Besides, for comparison purposes, the benchmark orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scheme and its corresponding user fairness transmission scheme are also proposed. The closed-form expressions of average block error rates for secondary users are derived over Nakagami-$m$ channels in both NOMA and benchmark OMA scheme. Simulation and analysis results show that a faraway primary network will benefit the spectrum sharing. In addition, shorter packets and more different channel conditions improve the NOMA gains over OMA. Besides, power allocation factors are found to be capable of achieving user fairness and the fairness transmission is achieved by the proposed scheme. Interestingly, when the channel differences are bigger enough, paring an extra NOMA user nearly does not affect the previous system performance.</description></item><item><title>Joint Resources Allocation and 3D Trajectory Optimization for UAV-Enabled Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138117</link><description>In view of the complementary characteristics of the UAV communication network and satellite communication network, we consider UAVs, satellites, and ground devices to form a space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) that can provide service to ground users after a natural disaster. In this scenario, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is employed as a base station (BS) or mobile edge computing (MEC) server to provide communication/computation services to ground users. In addition, the UAV MEC server can offload computing tasks to a satellite. To achieve the goal of satisfying the users' quality-of-experience (QoE) requirements and simultaneously maximizing the energy efficiency, we investigate the problem of joint optimization of the UAV 3D trajectory with resource allocation. Thus, this article establishes a joint optimization problem. Given that the above optimization problem contains a fractional multivariate objective function and nonconvex constraints, we solve the optimization problem by using an effective iterative algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed optimization scheme achieves high energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Novel RIS-Aided Code Index Modulation Scheme With Low-Complexity Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138929</link><description>In order to achieve high throughput and low-power consumption of the transmitter and improve the error performance of the receiver, a novel reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided code index modulation (RIS-CIM) is proposed in wireless communications. RIS-CIM utilizes the index of a spreading code to convey additional information, which further improves the spectral efficiency (SE) and error performance of the receiver by adding and adjusting the reflected phase shift of low-cost reflective elements at the RIS-aided relay. To reduce the computational complexity incurred by the maximum likelihood (ML) detection, we propose two low-complexity detections, namely the match correlation (MC) detection and the optimal low complexity (OLC) detection. MC and OLC approaches separate the dispreading from the demodulation in the detection, which achieves a significant reduction of the computational complexity over ML detection demonstrated by the analysis of the computational complexity measurements. We present a thorough analysis for the upper bound on the average bit error probability (ABEP) of the ML detection and the bit error probability (BEP) of the OLC detection of RIS-CIM, which is verified by numerical simulations. Numerical simulations also demonstrate that the proposed RIS-CIM performs better in terms of the error performance of ML detection than several existing CIM and RIS-related schemes at a given SE setting. In addition, the proposed ML and OLC detections achieve an error performance close to the ML detection under various measures of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the increasing SE in the simulations. Moreover, RIS-CIM can utilize a large number of reflective elements at the RIS-aided relay to offset the performance degradation caused by the improvement of SE.</description></item><item><title>Explicit Performance Limit for Joint Range and Direction of Arrival Estimation in Phased-Array Radar Sensors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10141676</link><description>For radar sensors in vehicle safety systems, it is of importance to establish a fundamental performance limit for the estimation accuracy of targets. Bayesian bounds, such as the Ziv&#8211;Zakai bound (ZZB), can provide an accurate prediction for the performance limit under all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. However, Bayesian bounds for the joint estimation of multiple parameters in radar systems have not been sufficiently studied and the explicit expression is still unavailable. In this article, we employ the thought of Shannon's information theory to propose a tight bound with closed-form expression for joint range and direction of arrival (DOA) estimation in phased-array radar. Based on the joint a posteriori probability density function, we define range-DOA entropy error (RDEE) as the entropy power of range and DOA. With normalized a posteriori entropies in low and high SNRs, the closed-form approximation for the theoretical RDEE is derived. The explicit theoretical RDEE is comprehensive and captures the effect of the SNR, the number of elements, and the ratio of the signal bandwidth to the carrier frequency. RDEE is compared with CRB and ZZB by a numerical simulation. The result shows RDEE and ZZB are almost identical in low SNR. Under high SNR, RDEE degenerates to ZZB.</description></item><item><title>Channel Estimation in Visible Light Communication Systems: The Effect of Input Signal-Dependent Noise</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10143671</link><description>Visible light communication (VLC) has been proposed as a promising way for next generation wireless communication networks to mitigate the scarcity of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum, and has consequently attracted much attention. This article introduces a single-input single-output (SISO) VLC system under the joint effects of statistical random channel and signal-dependent shot noise (SDSN). Moreover, it estimates the channel of the considered system using maximum likelihood (ML), least square (LS), linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE), maximum posteriori probability (MAP) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimators. Furthermore, a Bayesian Cram&#233;-Rao lower bound (BCRLB) is derived for the proposed system and it is compared to the mean square error (MSE) of the proposed estimators. The problem of unknown SDSN factor, $\zeta ^{2}$, at the receiver side is discussed and two solutions are investigated. The receiver of a VLC system under SDSN and random channel gain $h$ is designed and its BER is studied. Finally, Monte Carlo simulation results of the proposed estimators, which show the dramatic effect of the SDSN on the considered system, are provided. In particular, the presence of noise variance, as well as the SDSN factor, causes an increase in the MSE of the system, while increasing the power reinforces the system performance.</description></item><item><title>Decoupled UL/DL User Association in Wireless-Powered HetNets With Full-Duplex Small Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10144385</link><description>In this article, we propose two downlink (DL)-uplink (UL) decoupled (DUDe) user association schemes in wireless-powered full-duplex (FD) heterogeneous networks (HetNets). We consider a two-tier HetNet comprising of half-duplex (HD) massive multi-antenna macrocell base stations (MBSs) and dual-antenna FD small cell base stations (SBSs) to support UL and DL transmissions of FD user equipments (UEs). Each FD UE is first associated to one MBS/SBS, based on the mean maximum received power (MMP) scheme or maximum received power (MRP) to harvest energy. During the consecutive data transmission phase, UEs choose to receive DL traffic from the same MBSs/SBSs as that associated with during energy harvesting phase, and send UL traffic through the same/another SBS. Leveraging tools from the stochastic geometry, we develop an analytical framework to analyze the average harvested energy and derive expressions for the UL and DL coverage probabilities of the proposed DUDe user association schemes. Our results show that there is an optimal value for the SBS density in the wireless-powered FD HetNets, at which both DL and UL coverage probabilities are maximized. Moreover, by applying MMPA and MRPA scheme, wireless-powered FD HetNets with DUDe achieves up to 138.78% and 83.37% energy efficiency gain over the FD HetNets with DL/UL coupled user association scheme and without wireless power transfer, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Low-Latency Oriented Resource Allocation for MEC-Assisted Adaptive Bitrate Video Streaming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10144677</link><description>This article focuses on low-latency transmissions for mobile edge computing (MEC)-assisted adaptive bitrate (ABR) video streaming. With the aim to realize minimum video service latency, an optimization problem is formulated by jointly designing caching, computing and power allocation, subject to diverse video version downloading rate requirements and the limited resources of MEC servers. The formulated optimization problem turns out to be a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. To solve the problem and satisfy the low-latency service requirement of ABR video streaming, a low-complexity two-step iterative algorithm is proposed by decomposing the MINLP problem into two subproblems, a joint caching and computing subproblem and a power allocation subproblem. Due to the highly coupled nature of the caching and computing, the first subproblem is an integer nonlinear programming (INLP) problem. To solve it efficiently, the INLP problem is equivalently transformed into an integer linear programming (ILP) problem, which is thereafter solved by MATLAB intlinprog function. The second subproblem is a convex problem and is solved by low-complexity power allocation (LCPA) algorithm. Intensive simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges in a very short time, and can significantly reduce the average latency compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.</description></item><item><title>Joint Mode Selection and Resource Allocation for D2D and Femtocell Users in Dense Heterogeneous Networks With Full Frequency Reuse</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10144675</link><description>We consider the problem of joint mode selection and resource allocation for D2D and femtocell users in a three-tier dense heterogeneous network in which all the users can reuse the spectrum. The goal is to maximize their total weighted sum rate, subject to minimum rate requirements and maximum tolerable interference on the cellular system. Since the spectrum can be fully reused, the co-tier and cross-tier interferences among the users result in a mixed integer non-linear, non-convex program that is difficult to solve directly. Using insights into the structure of the interference, we derive a close, conservative approximation of the joint problem that has a convex relaxation that is tight. That enables good solutions to the joint problem to be obtained using a customized iterative algorithm employing the Lagrange dual decomposition method. Since the proposed iterative scheme is semi-distributed, the signaling overhead is mitigated. To further reduce the computational complexity, a low-complexity (primal) decomposition-based method is also introduced, in which we select the transmission mode heuristically based on the traffic level in the network, and then sequentially perform admission control, power control, and sub-channel allocation for the femtocell users and D2D users. Our simulation results indicate that the proposed iterative and heuristic algorithms, on average, achieve around 94% and 82% of the sum rate of the optimal Branch &amp; Bound method, respectively, and do so at much lower computational costs.</description></item><item><title>Downlink Transmitter Design With Statistical CSI for HF Skywave Massive MIMO</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10148823</link><description>In this article, we investigate the downlink (DL) transmitter design for high frequency (HF) skywave massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications with only statistical channel state information (CSI) available at the base station (BS). Motivated by the spatial sparsity of HF skywave massive MIMO channels, we first prove that the ergodic sum-rate maximization problem can be solved in the beam domain without any loss of optimality. We prove that the beam domain transmission only involving power allocation for the beams that each user terminal (UT) occupies is asymptotic optimal if there are a sufficiently large number of antennas at the BS. Then, we derive an iterative beam domain power allocation algorithm using majorization-minimization (MM). Furthermore, we investigate a low-complexity DL transmitter design with ergodic sum-rate upper bound. We show that the beam domain design is still optimal and the asymptotic optimal solution can also be obtained by the beam domain power allocation. Specifically, we prove that the power allocation for different UTs should be performed in non-overlapped beams and simplify the MM based iterative power allocation algorithm. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of proposed DL transmitter designs for HF skywave massive MIMO systems.</description></item><item><title>UAV Trajectory and Multi-User Beamforming Optimization for Clustered Users Against Passive Eavesdropping Attacks With Unknown CSI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10153699</link><description>This article tackles the fundamental passive eavesdropping problem in modern wireless communications in which the location and the channel state information (CSI) of the attackers are unknown. In this regard, we propose deploying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that serves as a mobile aerial relay (AR) to help ground base station (GBS) support a subset of vulnerable users. More precisely, our solution (1) clusters the single-antenna users in two groups to be either served by the GBS directly or via the AR, (2) employs optimal multi-user beamforming to the directly served users, and (3) optimizes the AR's 3D position, its multi-user beamforming matrix and transmit powers by combining closed-form solutions with machine learning techniques. Specifically, we design a plain beamforming and power optimization combined with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for an AR to optimize its trajectory for the security maximization of the served users. Numerical results show that the multi-user multiple input, single output (MU-MISO) system split between a GBS and an AR with optimized transmission parameters without knowledge of the eavesdropping channels achieves high secrecy capacities that scale well with increasing the number of users.

However, to further increase the network capacity, a large number of BSs need to be deployed, resulting in high cost and power consumption. To tackle this problem, econfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a cost-effective technology to enhance energy and spectral efficiency of wireless communications. In this article, we consider an RIS-aided CF network by exploiting their complementary advantages where each user assisted by a dedicated RIS can associate with multiple BSs. We first characterize each user's average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in the RIS-CF network. Then, we formulate an SINR balancing problem to maximize the minimum SINR among all users by designing the BS-user associations. Despite of the non-convexity and combinatorial feature of this problem, a two-step fractional linearization algorithm is developed to solve it optimally. Specifically, we transform a nested mixed-integer linear fractional program (MILFP) into a solvable mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem through the generalized fractional programming and reformulation-linearization method. Finally, we provide numerical results to validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm compared to other benchmark schemes.</description></item><item><title>Robust Joint Beamforming Optimization for RISs-Empowered Cell-Free Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10151920</link><description>Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a promising economical solution to implement cell-free networks. In this article, the joint active and passive beamforming optimization of access points (APs) and RISs for the RISs-empowered cell-free network in the presence of channel state information (CSI) estimation errors is investigated. By taking the CSI estimation errors into account, we start with deriving the expression of a tight lower bound on the exact sum-rate, which is taken as the optimization criteria. Then, a robust joint beamforming optimization algorithm is proposed to obtain the highest sum-rate by using the lower bound, so as to obtain the best result out of the worst-case. In addition, a counter-intuitive but interesting result can be concluded via rigorous mathematical derivations that CSI estimation errors always impact the optimization of active transmitting beamforming matrices of APs, but surprisingly have no impact on the optimization of passive reflecting beamforming matrices of RISs when the covariance matrices of CSI estimation errors seen from two sides of each channel are proportional to an identity matrix. Simulation results demonstrate that RISs can considerably improve the sum-rate of the conventional cell-free network, and confirm the resilience of the proposed algorithm against CSI uncertainty.</description></item><item><title>Cooperative NOMA-Based Spectrum Leasing With Multiple Secondary Users</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10160162</link><description>This article proposes a new cooperative nonorthogonal multiple access-based spectrum leasing (CNOMA-SL) framework for enhanced network performance. Herein, the system is comprised of a primary network and a secondary network with $n$-transmitting users. Primary and secondary users exploit an underlay spectrum leasing scheme to transmit signals to a relay station (RS), which forwards the signals to the corresponding receivers. Two phases of data transmission are assumed. In Phase I, the secondary transmitters employ uplink NOMA to transmit the symbols. The RS then uses downlink NOMA to broadcast the received symbols in Phase II. We employ the maximum ratio combining decoding scheme and propose a successive-interference-cancellation concept with ($n+1$) stages to decode the symbols at the primary and secondary receiving ends, respectively. Considering a transmission power constraint imposed at the secondary transmitters, we derive the closed-form expressions for achievable rate and outage probability for both primary and secondary users. Simulation results manifest that, compared with the conventional cooperative orthogonal multiple access-based spectrum leasing scheme, the proposed CNOMA-SL exhibits improved performance in terms of both achievable rate and outage probability. It is also revealed that the system performs better when the RS takes the lease of the whole spectrum. Furthermore, if more interference power is allowed to the primary receiver, the secondary users reach higher achievable rates.</description></item><item><title>Joint Energy and Information Precoding for NOMA-Based WPCNs Aided by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10160160</link><description>In a wireless powered communication network (WPCN), wireless energy acquisition is weak due to the fading characteristic of wireless link, which makes it hard to supply the energy. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising performance enhancement technology for WPCNs, which can improve the energy and spectral efficiency, expand the network coverage, and thus improve the throughput. This article proposes a new framework for energy harvesting and information transmission of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based WPCNs aided by RIS. The total transmission capacity is maximized by joint optimization of energy precoding, information precoding, and the phase shift of RIS, which turns out to be a non-convex problem. Under the multi user scenario, we propose a joint optimization algorithm combing alternating optimization (AO), semidefinite relaxation (SDR), and successive convex approximation (SCA) methods, which is called ASS algorithm for short. Numerical results prove that compared with the non-RIS system, the ASS can increase the throughput of the system under multiuser scenario by 502.49%. For the system under single scenario, the energy precoding and information precoding are determined respectively by using the beamforming and the traditional maximal ratio combining (MRC) algorithm. The optimization problem is transformed into a complex higher order form optimization problem. Finally, a closed-form expression of the channel capacity is derived.</description></item><item><title>Combination of Throughput-Optimal Scheduling and Network Utility Maximization in NOMA Systems With Flow-Level Dynamics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10155267</link><description>In wireless networks, the network queue stability (throughput-optimality) and the network utility maximization are two crucial tasks for network operators. Besides, new techniques of mobile communications, e.g. the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), have emerged endlessly to meet coming challenges. In this article, we for the first time, investigate a downlink NOMA system with flow-level dynamics, where long-lived flows and short-lived flows exist simultaneously, and formulate an optimization problem of user selection and power allocation. We aim to maximize the network utility at each time slot and simultaneously guarantee the throughput-optimality, under the quality of service (QoS) constraints.

In the performance evaluation, the benchmark algorithm is provided for comparison. And we take the energy efficiency (EE) as an example of the network utility and define the scheduling delay (SD). Simulation results show that the suboptimal algorithm is throughput-optimal, and understandably, its performances could be better than those in the benchmark algorithm in terms of EE and SD, as long as the appropriate parameter is set.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced Hybrid Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning Over Heterogeneous Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10155155</link><description>In this work, a Hybrid Hierarchical Federated Edge Learning (HHFEL) architecture that consists of a device layer, an edge layer, and a cloud layer over heterogeneous networks, is investigated for large-scale model training. In such systems, learning efficiency is severely degraded by limited communication resources and device heterogeneity in terms of local data distribution and computation capability, especially for synchronous FL mechanisms where the training of each round should wait for the slowest device. To tackle this issue, asynchronous FL is proposed, which allows the devices with powerful computation and communication capabilities exchanging information with the server more frequently. However, this asynchronous FL framework faces a new challenge of low accuracy caused by the imbalanced local model updating. To overcome the shortage of both synchronous and asynchronous FLs, we propose an enhanced online semi-asynchronous FL mechanism between the edge-device layers, where each device trains its local model with the newly generated data and each edge server aggregates a number of local models based on their arrival order in each round. Particularly, devices with faster training speeds would fully utilize the idle time by training their local models repetitively. Meanwhile, synchronous FL with an edge elastic update strategy is adopted to the cloud-edge layers for personalized information exchange. Considering the continuous data generation feature, we formulate the objective problem as an online Markov Decision Process (MDP) to realize efficient communication-and-computing HHFEL via joint device selection and resource allocation. Due to the non-convex and combinatorial problem structure, we develop a hybrid Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) approach with low computational complexity to adapt the device selection and resource allocation strategies. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism compared with existing benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Laser-Powered Multi-UAV URLLC Systems: Reliability and Scheduling Performance Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10163402</link><description>This article investigates the multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication system with multiple full-duplex (FD) mobile users under ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) constraints. The energy-constrained UAVs are powered with the help of laser beams sourced by the laser beam directors (LBDs) which are randomly deployed with Poisson point Process (PPP). The received power from LBDs is harvested at UAVs using the power-splitting energy harvesting (EH) architecture to improve its lifespan. Moreover, the received power at the UAV is modeled using the free-space optical (FSO) range equation, and is randomly affected by atmospheric turbulence and misalignment errors. With multi-user diversity scenario, we provide the mathematical framework for three user scheduling schemes, namely, random (RND) scheduling, absolute (ABS) signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) based scheduling and normalized (NRM) SINR scheduling schemes, wherein the UAV communicates with a single scheduled user in a given slot due to its limited abilities. The expressions for the outage probability, coverage probability and the block error rate (BLER) are derived for all the scheduling schemes under consideration. The effects of various parameters such as shadowing severity, URLLC parameters, EH, laser beam's angular spread and imperfect CSI are analyzed. The derived expressions are validated through Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations.</description></item><item><title>Joint Rate Allocation and Power Control for RSMA-Based Communication and Radar Coexistence Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10135154</link><description>We consider a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-based communication and radar coexistence (CRC) system. The proposed system allows an RSMA-based communication system to share spectrum with multiple radars, which significantly improves spectral efficiency, energy efficiency and quality of service (QoS) of communication users (CUs). Due to the spectrum sharing, the communication network and the radars cause interference to each other, which reduces the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the radars as well as the data rate of the CUs. Therefore, a major problem is to maximize the sum rate of the CUs while guaranteeing their QoS requirements of data transmissions and the SINR requirements of multiple radars. To achieve the objective, we formulate a new problem that optimizes i) common rates of the CUs, ii) transmit power of the common message of the CUs, iii) transmit power of the private messages for the intended CUs, and iv) transmit power of the radar systems. The problem is non-convex, and thus we propose two algorithms. The first sequential quadratic programming (SQP) as the state-of-the-art in nonlinear programming method can quickly return a local optimal solution. The second is an additive approximation scheme (AAS) which solves the problem globally in a reasonable amount of time. Simulation results show the significant improvement of the AAS compared with the SQP in terms of sum rate. Furthermore, with the AAS, the sum rate of the CUs only slightly decreases when the radars' SINR is significantly increased. This implies that the AAS supports the RSMA-based communication system which allows to well coexist with the radars.</description></item><item><title>Underwater Real-Time Video Transmission via Wireless Optical Channels With Swarms of AUVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10135165</link><description>Underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) has received widespread attention recently due to its distinct advantages in terms of high bandwidth, low power consumption, low delay and confidentiality. However, unlike underwater acoustic communication systems, it suffers from constraints, such as limited communication range and misalignment in oceanic extreme environments. To perform long-distance high bandwidth transmission such as real-time video streaming, it requires relaying technology to perform reliable and robust transmission. Although pre-deploying a large number of sensor nodes is one of the possible solutions, this is impractical in response to emergency events, such as oil pipeline leakage and maritime search and rescue. To this end, in this article, we propose to leverage a swarm of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to establish reliable underwater optical communication links in a rapidly changing marine environment for real-time video transmission. We first model the optical transmission channel, and then calculate both the optical angle and the reliable communicating range that satisfy a pre-defined bit error rate (BER). We then formulate the optimization problem based on two aligned solutions while targeting on minimizing both deployment energy consumption and time latency, in which the AUV's uncertainty issue caused by localization error and hovering instability is considered. Finally, we design an adaptive optical beam and power adjustment algorithm to enhance the robustness of the optical link further. Through extensive simulations, the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is efficient and achieves reliable and robust communication.</description></item><item><title>Federated Quantum Neural Network With Quantum Teleportation for Resource Optimization in Future Wireless Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138114</link><description>The following study introduces FT-QNN, a federated and quantum teleportation &#8211;based quantum neural network, utilized to optimize resource allocation for future wireless communications. The proposed FT-QNN consists of edge quantum neural networks (QNNs) and a cloud QNN, while quantum teleportation allows the cloud QNN to obtain the outputs of edge QNNs without requiring prior measurements on the output states, allowing the cloud to process the outputs directly as quantum states. As a particular case to demonstrate its applicability for wireless resource allocation, FT-QNN is then employed to optimize transmit power allocation coefficients in a power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based system, aiming to maximize the achievable sum-rate. FT-QNN yields lower complexity compared to a distributed QNN scheme without quantum teleportation, while the numerical results also demonstrated that the FT-QNN is capable to achieve a similar sum-rate compared to the scheme without quantum teleportation.</description></item><item><title>A Privacy-Preserving Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol for V2G Communications Using SSI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138699</link><description>The popularity of Electric Vehicles (EVs) has been rising globally in recent years. With the demand for EVs, associated cyber threats are also increasing. Users expose their personal information while charging their EVs, leading to privacy threats. This article proposes a user-empowered, privacy-aware, authenticated key exchange protocol for Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) communications. The proposed protocol leverages the concept of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and is based on the concept of Decentralized Identifiers (DID) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs). The use of DIDs empowers users by helping them to have complete control over their identities. The charging station and the user verify that the other party is legitimate by verifying the VC before proceeding with the charging services. Key recovery is another issue we address in this article. A method to recover lost keys is incorporated into the proposed protocol. The proposed protocol also incorporates an effective user revocation policy. We present formal security proof and informal analysis to show the protocol's robustness against several attacks. We also provide a detailed performance analysis to show that the proposed protocol is efficient.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Self-Adaptive Task Outsourcing Decision Making for Edge-Assisted Multi-UAV Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10144676</link><description>This paper proposes a two-stage novel algorithm for intelligent edge-assisted multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) surveillance services. In the first stage, multiple UAVs determine their optimal positions to detect as many target faces as possible for efficient surveillance using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL). Multi-UAVs must be coordinated and optimally positioned for effective surveillance depending on the target person's location. It is also significantly important to consider the battery performance of the UAVs. In the second stage, every single UAV performs face identification in monitored areas, where two sequential scheduling methods make decisions: (i) edge selection for remote computing via max-weight scheduling and (ii) transmit power allocation scheduling to deliver the images to scheduled edges for time-average energy consumption minimization subject to stability. The identification execution requires computing power, and its complexity and time depend on the number of faces in the captured image. Consequently, the task cannot be fully executed by an individual UAV in high image arrival regimes or images with a high density of faces. In those conditions, UAVs can leverage computing support from nearby edges capable of AI-based face identification tasks. Importantly, computing task distribution should be energy-efficient and delay-minimal due to constraints imposed by the UAV system's characteristics and applications. We remark that selected edges should complete their computing tasks with similar delay to minimize idle time among the edges, which is why we chose min-max scheduling. To summarize, our proposed novel two-stage algorithm accomplishes efficient multi-UAV positioning corresponding to user-defined weight (overlapped threshold) and minimizes UAVs' transmission power while preserving stability constraints.</description></item><item><title>Multi-User Dynamic Computation Offloading and Resource Allocation in 5G MEC Heterogeneous Networks With Static and Dynamic Subchannels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10148793</link><description>With the rapid development of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) technology, the computationally intensive requests of end devices can be offloaded to MEC servers directly, which equipped at the edge of wireless networks. Through offloading, the performances such as the execution delay as well as the energy consumption can be effectively improved, which can significantly enhance the quality of user experience. Given the dynamics and randomness of computation requests arrival, the energy in the battery, the radio network environment, and the computation resource in the MEC server, it is a challenge to perform efficient offloading. Based on these problems, this article proposes dynamic optimization schemes with queuing theory for the cases of the static subchannel and dynamic subchannel during a time slot separately in 5G MEC heterogeneous networks with multiple MDs equipped with the function of energy harvesting. In the schemes, offloading decisions and radio allocation strategies will be dynamically coordinated. They are also jointly allocated along with changing wireless communication resources and computation demands aiming to minimize the system average execution delay. Specifically, it is assumed that the offloading requests can be transmitted through either macro base stations or small base stations. In the case of the static subchannel, a joint resource allocation and computation offloading scheme based on Lyapunov optimization and Simulated Annealing Genetic Algorithm (SAGA) is put forward. As for the dynamic subchannel, the leader-and-follower model is adopted and solved by SAGA and Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) method. At last, the effectiveness of the proposed schemes is verified through several simulations.</description></item><item><title>Joint Computation Offloading and Data Caching in Multi-Access Edge Computing Enabled Internet of Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10148810</link><description>Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has attracted global research interests across extensive applications. Due to the significant increase in the number of vehicles accessing the Internet, there are several challenges in designing efficient task offloading and data caching strategies to improve the utilization of the network resource and provide the users with high-quality services. To this end, this study proposes the task offloading and resource allocation schemes, including the selection of execution mode, data transmission path, the assignment of the sub-channels, the strategies of caching and caching updating in a Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) enabled IoV system with multiple mobile vehicles equipped with the capacity of energy harvesting. Specifically, the downlink relevant data or the uplink offloaded data can be transmitted through either the Macro Base Station(MBS) or the Road Side Unit(RSU). Also, we consider two different situations: off-peak hours and peak hours, in which the execution mode is different. In off-peak hours, the tasks can directly offload to the MEC server, and the average execution delay minimization problem is modelled as an integer programming problem, which is solved by Simulated Annealing Genetic Algorithm (SAGA). In peak hours, the tasks can be either executed locally or offloaded to the MEC server, and the formulated problem are more complicated, which are solved by Deep Q Network (DQN). Finally, a series of simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed schemes.</description></item><item><title>Compressed Channel Estimation for Near-Field XL-MIMO Using Triple Parametric Decomposition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10132547</link><description>With the presence of the conventional angular-domain representation, the energy leakage effect is evident for the near-field extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) channel, which further leads to ambiguous channel power detection, significantly eroding channel estimation performance. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel Triple Parametric Decomposition (TPD) framework to facilitate compressed channel estimation in the XL-MIMO system. Specifically, we examine the case of a uniform planar array (UPA) with the geometry parameters involving a pair of azimuth-elevation angles and distances in an attempt to achieve independent decomposition by constructing their own covariance matrices. Then, by utilizing the on- and off-grid techniques, we obtain the sparse recovery of angles and distances information in the absence of energy leakage effect at reduced gridding complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed TPD achieves significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>SER Optimization in OFDM-IM Systems With Nonlinear Power Amplifiers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10132544</link><description>Power amplifiers (PAs) lead to nonlinear distortion in index modulation assisted OFDM (OFDM-IM) systems when the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is high. But PAPR reduction in OFDM-IM is more complicated than that in traditional OFDM owing to the frequent switch of subcarrier states between active and idle. When implementing OFDM-IM on resource-limited platforms like battery-powered Internet of Things (IoT) devices, PAPR cannot always be ideally eliminated due to the complexity of the reduction algorithm and the limitation of computation resources. Hence, performance optimization under non-negligible PAPR becomes an important issue. This paper performs symbol error rate (SER) optimization in OFDM-IM systems with high PAPR. First, we derive a low complexity expression of receiver signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in nonlinear OFDM-IM systems. Second, we find that SER in OFDM-IM is affected by the nonlinear distortion in both constellation mapping and index estimation. With this observation, we derive a closed-form expression of SER and prove that there is a lower bound. Third, we do SER optimization and identify the optimal system operating point with respect to the minimum SER. Finally, we validate our analysis through simulations.</description></item><item><title>DNN-Based Fractional Doppler Channel Estimation for OTFS Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138432</link><description>In this paper, we proposed a deep neural network (DNN) based fractional Doppler channel estimation scheme for orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation in the air-to-ground communication scenario with high-dynamic Doppler. Based on the zero-padded OTFS structure, the traditional pilot pattern with guard symbols is adopted. The received pilots in the OTFS domain are used as the inputs of the network to estimate the channel parameters which are used in the MRC algorithm to demodulate the signal. In our proposed method, it can achieve the similar performance with 14 dB boost of pilot energy comparing with the ideal channel estimation case, while the conventional method requires 30 dB higher. Both the accuracy and generalization ability of the DNN network are validated.</description></item><item><title>Secure Transmission for STAR-RIS Aided NOMA Against Internal Eavesdropping</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10138694</link><description>Simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) has attracted extensive attentions due to its prominent advantages to future wireless networks. This correspondence considers a downlink multi-input single-output non-orthogonal multiple access system, in which the STAR-RIS is utilized to improve the secrecy performance. To restrain the internal eavesdropping, we formulate a secrecy rate maximization problem and propose a secure transmission design via the joint active and passive beamforming optimization with optimum power allocation. To decouple optimization variables, the original non-convex problem is divided into two subproblems, which are transformed into convex forms via successive convex approximation and solved by alternating optimization. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme in the security enhancement.</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning and Image Super-Resolution-Guided Beam and Power Allocation for mmWave Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10146432</link><description>In this article, we develop a deep learning (DL)-guided hybrid beam and power allocation approach for multiuser millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks, which facilitates swift beamforming at the base station (BS). The following persisting challenges motivated our research: (i) User and vehicular mobility, as well as redundant beam-reselections in mmWave networks, degrade the efficiency; (ii) Due to the large beamforming dimension at the BS, the beamforming weights predicted by the cutting-edge DL-based methods often do not suit the channel distributions; (iii) Co-located user devices may cause a severe beam conflict, thus deteriorating system performance. To address the aforementioned challenges, we exploit the synergy of supervised learning and super-resolution technology to enable low-overhead beam- and power allocation. In the first step, we propose a method for beam-quality prediction. It is based on deep learning and explores the relationship between high- and low-resolution beam images (energy). Afterward, we develop a DL-based allocation approach, which enables high-accuracy beam and power allocation with only a portion of the available time-sequential low-resolution images. Theoretical and numerical results verify the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</description></item><item><title>Joint Power Allocation and Passive Beamforming for RIS-Assisted Wireless Energy-Constrained Systems With Multi-User Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10149523</link><description>In this paper, we consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless communications system with multi-user scheduling, where a pilot-embedded data transmission is carried out from a selected user to an access point (AP) with the aid of an RIS. Specifically, by taking into account a transmit energy constraint, we propose a joint passive beamforming and power allocation optimization (JPB-PAO) scheme for the RIS-assisted wireless system, in which a problem of joint optimization on the pilot power, data power, and RIS's phase shifts is formulated for maximizing the achievable rate of the user-AP transmission. To this end, we propose a Dinkelbach and majorization-minimization (DMM) aided JPB-PAO (termed as DMM-JPB-PAO) scheme for the sake of obtaining a semi-closed form expression of the optimal RIS phase shifts, based on which a closed-form solution of power allocation is derived. Moreover, we adopt the widely used semidefinite relaxation (SDR) algorithm as a baseline to solve the JPB-PAO problem, which is referred to as the SDR-JPB-PAO. Numerical results show that our proposed DMM-JPB-PAO achieves almost the same achievable rate as the SDR-JPB-PAO at a much lower computational complexity. Meanwhile, DMM-JPB-PAO scheme yields a higher achievable rate than the passive beamforming optimization with fixed power allocation (PBO-FPA) scheme and the random passive beamforming with fixed power allocation (RPB-FPA) scheme.</description></item><item><title>Editorial Introduction to the November 2023 Issue of the IEEE Journal of Photovoltaics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10309878</link><description>This issue of the IEEE JOURNAL OF PHOTOVOLTAICS (JPV) contains a number of articles I think you will find interesting.

PV represented 56% of newly installed global electricity generating capacity for 2022, the second year in a row that this metric exceeded 50%. The combined contributions of nonhydro renewable electricity generation (solar, wind, tidal, geothermal, and biomass) was comparable to that of hydropower for the first time in history. However, the total combination of carbon-free generation sources (hydro, nuclear, and renewables) stayed constant at &#8764;38% of total electricity, with the annual growth in overall generation (&#8764;2%) balancing the large fractional growth in solar (25%) and wind (14%). Following its initial publication in 2021 with 1990&#8211;2020 data, this annual article will continue to collect information from multiple sources and present it systematically as a convenient reference for IEEE JPV readers. This year, for the first time, we present data on the growth of storage capacity. We find that growth of stationary battery storage now exceeds growth of pumped hydropower storage. That same annual investment in new stationary batteries, however, is small compared to the growth of battery storage in electric vehicles.</description></item><item><title>Microscopic Origins of Contact Deterioration During Annealing of Silicon Heterojunction Solar Cell Contacts</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10239120</link><description>Over the last years, the dominating charge carrier transport barrier in silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cells could be boiled down to the contact of the indium&#8211;tin oxide (ITO) to the doped amorphous silicon (a-Si) layer. The formation of a parasitic oxide at this junction was hypothesized to act as a source for contact deterioration after annealing. However, no experimental proof could be obtained so far. In this contribution, we simultaneously investigate the contact resistivity and nanoscopic structure of the electron contact of a SHJ solar cell in the annealing temperature range between 140 $^\circ \text{C}$ and 240 $^\circ \text{C}$. For this purpose, micro transfer length measurements, time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, and electron&#8211;energy loss spectroscopy as well as energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy in a (scanning) transmission electron microscope are applied. A minimum contact resistivity of around 120 $\text{m}\Omega {\text{cm}^{2}}$ is obtained at 160 $^\circ \text{C}$. At higher temperatures, the contact resistivities increase rapidly. This contact degradation correlates with the thickening of a parasitic silicon oxide layer found at the ITO/a-Si junction and an increase in Si oxidation state within this interlayer. Additionally, Ag from the metallization diffuses into the Si, which may induce deep acceptor trap states. Furthermore, a TiO${}_{\text{x}}$ layer with ${\text{x}}\sim {1}$ is proven between ITO and the AgPdTi metallization, which does not impair the current transport.</description></item><item><title>Operando Temperature Measurements of Photovoltaic Laser Power Converter Devices Under Continuous High-Intensity Illumination</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10232878</link><description>Photovoltaic devices that operate under extremely high irradiances, such as laser power converters (LPCs), may also operate at elevated temperatures, even under active cooling, as the result of large temperature gradients. We demonstrate the operation of GaAs LPC devices under orders of magnitude of irradiances up to 150 W/cm2 in a monochromatic laser simulator with an active cooling stage. The steady-state open-circuit voltage (VOC) as a function of irradiance is known to droop at high irradiance as the result of junction heating, but the junction temperature can be difficult to measure by conventional methods. Fast, transient VOC measurements under these extreme operating conditions are used here to determine the junction temperature. Empirical VOC temperature coefficients of the devices at each irradiance of interest are determined and used as an integral part of this technique. We show that the thermal design of different LPC devices strongly affects the operating temperature of the junctions. Knowledge of the operating temperature can be a strong tool for understanding the nature of loss mechanisms and improving the design for the operation of photovoltaic LPCs at high irradiances. This technique can be used for laboratory devices during initial design as well as to characterize mass-produced and packaged devices for quality control.</description></item><item><title>Considering the Variability of Soiling in Long-Term PV Performance Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10232369</link><description>This study presents the development of a methodology for evaluating the variability associated with soiling on long-term photovoltaic (PV) forecasting. Independent engineering firms typically build forecasts for large PV plants through the use of the PVsyst software, where monthly soiling losses are one of many inputs to the P50 model. Subsequently, long-term performance distributions are constructed through a Monte Carlo analysis that includes various factors, such as satellite irradiance modeling uncertainty, uncertainty in the PVsyst model, and long-term irradiance variability. Often the PVsyst model uncertainty is increased to account for sites with significant soiling concerns but no systematic method has been presented in the literature to specifically include soiling variability within long-term performance uncertainty. In this work soiling information from 16 sites in the U.S. Southwest are combined with 24 years of rainfall data to generate 24 years of energy production with soiling losses and then subsequently generate probability of exceedance values (e.g., P50, P90, P95&#8230;). The results show that the size of the 90% confidence interval (P5&#8211;P95) can increase from &#8211;0.7% to 10.1% when interannual soiling variability and soiling rate uncertainty is included.</description></item><item><title>Field and Accelerated Aging of Cracked Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10255107</link><description>Cracks can form in silicon solar cells in an otherwise intact photovoltaic module due to mechanical stresses such as rough handling or hail. The immediate impact on power due to these cracks can be readily measured, but it is also known from accelerated testing that the cracks can worsen over time. However, it is not clear how to predict the extent of future field degradation due to cracked cells, which requires a calibrated accelerated test. We describe progress toward such a test. In particular, we report on the outdoor aging of modules with cracked cells for nearly two years. We find that modules with cracked cells degraded in the field an average of 0.5% absolute more than uncracked modules over a period of 21 months. We also characterize the modules with multitemperature electroluminescence and find that the degradation is associated with cell fragments that become electrically isolated. We compare the weathering outdoors with the two types of accelerated tests: thermal cycling and a novel accelerated test, dynamic mechanical acceleration (DMX). DMX can apply thousands of pressure cycles at a frequency of approximately 10 Hz and pressures &lt;200&#8201;Pa, which are relevant to the wind-driven pressure cycles experienced by modules outdoors. We find that the thermal cycles designed to reproduce the cumulative temperature change from the field overestimate field degradation and can excite noncell-crack degradation. DMX results were promising, reproducing degradation levels similar to those observed outdoors over 21 months with a test that can be performed in less than an hour.</description></item><item><title>Role of Solar Photovoltaics for a Sustainable Energy System in Puerto Rico in the Context of the Entire Caribbean Featuring the Value of Offshore Floating Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268669</link><description>The Caribbean and Puerto Rico are lagging in ramping renewable energy (RE) capacities. Energy system transition pathways reaching 100% RE by 2050 for Puerto Rico and the Caribbean are analyzed for all energy supplies. Islands are often limited in available land; therefore, scenario variations are considered, including offshore floating photovoltaics (PV). The results for Puerto Rico clearly indicate the enormous benefits of reaching 100% RE, as the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) can be reduced from more than 100 &#8364;/MWh in 2020 to 47.4 &#8364;/MWh in 2050, and the levelized cost of energy, including all energy sectors, declines from 79 to 53 &#8364;/MWh, respectively. PV reaches 81% of all electricity supply, leading to 33.4 GW installed capacity, thereof 17.5 GW offshore floating PV due to area limitation. Without area limitation, the total system cost would be about 2.7% lower. The key metrics for the Caribbean development from 2020 to 2050 are as follows: electricity generation from 110 to 677 TWh, PV supply share from 2% to 92%, PV capacity from 1 to 332 GW, thereof 19% prosumer, 81% utility-scale with up to 38% offshore floating PV, and LCOE from above 100 to 31.9 &#8364;/MWh. The prosperity of Puerto Rico and the Caribbean is closely related to solar PV, the dominating source of energy in their Solar-to-X Economy.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Fast-Firing Conditions on Light-&#8201;and Elevated-Temperature-Induced Degradation (LeTID) in Ga-Doped Cz&#8211;Si</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10235899</link><description>The fast-firing step commonly applied at the end of solar cell production lines triggers &#8220;Light- and elevated-Temperature-Induced Degradation&#8221; (LeTID) effects of the carrier lifetime in Ga-doped Cz&#8211;Si wafers and solar cells made thereof. As far as the defect formation within the silicon bulk is concerned, the key parameters of the fast-firing step are the peak firing temperature (FT) and the band velocity vband of the conveyor belt, where the latter mainly defines the cooling ramp after the firing peak. In this contribution, we show that the extent of LeTID and the dependence on the applied temperature during degradation increase strongly with increasing measured FT (from 680 &#176;C to 800 &#176;C), vband (from 2.8 to 7.2 m/min), and the refractive index n of the hydrogen-rich silicon nitride layer deposited on the wafer surfaces (from 2.07 to 2.37). Through temperature-dependent degradation experiments, we determine an activation energy of EA = (0.55 &#177; 0.10) eV of the LeTID mechanism in Ga-doped Cz&#8211;Si, which is independent of FT and vband. From this observation we conclude that a single defect activation mechanism is most likely responsible for the examined LeTID effect, independent of the firing conditions. However, the concentration of recombination-active defect centers after LeTID depends critically on FT, vband, and n, which we attribute to variations of the in-diffused hydrogen concentrations from the silicon nitride layers during firing. Our experiments hence point towards an involvement of hydrogen in the LeTID mechanism observed in Ga-doped Cz&#8211;Si.</description></item><item><title>Bandgap Engineered Double-Cation/Double-Halide Quasi-Cubic Perovskite for Highly Efficient (&gt;36%) Indoor Photovoltaics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10227528</link><description>Double-cation- and double-halide-based perovskites are well known for their better structural stability and improved efficiency in photovoltaics compared to single-cation-based perovskites. Herein, we have investigated the effects of the addition of formamidinium bromide (FABr) in methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite for the formation of a double-cation/double-halide (DCDH) perovskite structure, namely, MA1&#8722;xFAxPbI3&#8722;xBrx, which is specifically engineered for efficient indoor light harvesting. The indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) fabricated from the DCDH perovskite layer exhibited a distinctively higher short-circuit current density (JSC) of 172.64 &#956;A&#183;cm&#8722;2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.91 V, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 36.29% compared to the JSC of 159.03 &#956;A&#183;cm&#8722;2, VOC of 0.84 V, and PCE of 27.89% observed for the MAPbI3 IPVs under the simulated indoor LED light at 1000 lux. The use of formamidinium (FA+) cation and bromide (Br&#8722;) anion in the DCDH perovskite helps in stabilizing the perovskite crystalline phase from tetragonal to quasi-cubic, increases the bandgap, and complements the optical absorption in the visible region. Moreover, FA+ and Br&#8722; suppress the trap states and nonradiative recombination loss in the DCDH perovskite structure. The results from this study will help researchers understand the mechanism of DCDH-perovskite-based IPVs, which is well explained by studying the charge carrier recombination dynamics and its correlation with the crystal structure of the perovskites under indoor lighting conditions. In addition, the optimized FABr-incorporated device exhibits a PCE of 20.59% under standard 1-sun conditions, which is better than the reference MAPbI3 device (17.16%).</description></item><item><title>Albedo-Dependent Bifacial Gain Losses in Photovoltaic Modules With Rear-Side Support Structures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10268048</link><description>Bifacial photovoltaic (PV) modules can generate power even from rear-side solar irradiance. Consequently, the rear side of the bifacial PV module must not be hindered by structures. However, structures such as beams are often installed behind modules to ensure structural strength and for various other reasons. In such cases, the output power of the bifacial module is reduced because of partial shading on the rear side. This study entailed an analysis of the albedo dependence of the bifacial gain losses in bifacial modules due to inherent partial shading produced by rear-side support structures (e.g., mounting, frame, and beams). An analysis method combining ray tracing and electrical circuit simulation was implemented and verified through field experiments. The results demonstrate that the bifacial gain decreases nonlinearly at high albedo when the beam is closely attached to the rear side of the module. This loss is reduced by half upon placing the beam at a distance equivalent to the thickness of the beam from the module. The results also indicate the mismatch loss caused by each part of the module's support structure.</description></item><item><title>Comparative Evaluation of Solar Power Smoothing Techniques Considering Battery Degradation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10237120</link><description>The intermittent and volatile nature of renewable energy sources (RESs) has introduced new technical challenges that affect the secure and reliable grid operation. These challenges can be tackled at the RES level by reducing power fluctuations with the use of power smoothing (PS) techniques. Several PS methods have been proposed in the literature to smooth RES output exploiting battery energy storage systems (BESSs). However, a comprehensive comparative evaluation of PS methods is missing. Moreover, the effect of the long-term PS operation on the BESS life is usually ignored in such analyses. This article proposes a methodology for the systematic evaluation of well-established PS techniques, comparing their effectiveness on the PS of photovoltaic output based on various signal metrics. In addition, an accurate aging model for lithium-ion batteries is employed to investigate the impact of PS on the BESS lifetime, highlighting the main parameters that influence capacity degradation.</description></item><item><title>Development of a Fault Detection and Localization Algorithm for Photovoltaic Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10236501</link><description>Photovoltaic systems provide electrical power with reduced emissions at competitive costs compared to legacy systems. A low or medium voltage dc distribution system is usually used for solar integration. In dc systems, parallel and series arc faults are a safety concern. Thus, reliable and timely detection and mitigation of arc faults are critical. DC arc detection methods typically use time or frequency spectrum variations of the circuit current or voltage to differentiate the arcing event from other system events. Since practical systems include power electronics and maximum-power-point tracking, any detection scheme must perform robustly in the electrical environment that these components establish in the dc power system. A capacitor placed in parallel with the main system is an effective sensor for series arc fault detection and localization applicable in this complex electrical environment. This article shows that the analysis of the amplitude, polarity, and spectrum characteristics of the capacitor current and voltage resulting from perturbations caused by the arc provides an effective method to identify and localize faults. The detection accuracy of the proposed approach is 98.3% and the localization accuracy rate is 100% for the correctly detected faults.</description></item><item><title>Fault Detection and Location Algorithm by Voltage Characteristics for PV System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10243162</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) system has been widely used to reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and environmental pollution. The PV system is susceptible to line-to-ground (LG) and line-to-line (LL) faults due to equipment aging and insulation damage. The LG and LL faults will lead to malfunction and even catastrophic fire hazards in a PV system. Usually, there are protection devices. However, the operation of the maximum power point tracking controller and the effect of partial shading will lower the fault current to be unable to trigger the protection devices. Thus, it is difficult to detect and locate the faults accurately. It is necessary to study the characteristics of LG and LL faults for fault detection. This article determines the voltage characteristics of the LG and LL faults with the consideration of fault impedance and partial shading. The fault detection and location algorithm based on fault voltage behavior is established and developed on MATLAB. According to the simulation and experimental results, the proposed technique can detect and locate the LG and LL faults effectively despite the effects of fault impedance and partial shading in a PV system.</description></item><item><title>Detection, Classification, and Location of Open-Circuit and Short-Circuit Faults in Solar Photovoltaic Array: An Approach Using Single Sensor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225538</link><description>Solar PV arrays are exponentially employed in all possible spheres, ranging from a few hundred watts to megawatts. In this context, fault detection, classification, and location identification are the major objective for the efficient operation and maximum power extraction from the solar PV array. In spite of the numerous existing algorithms carried out for this objective, a new experimental study on the PV fault is put forward by obtaining all the module voltages (MVs), assisted by a simple low-cost relay with a single voltage sensor. Faults taken for this study are open-circuit (OC), bypass diode OC, short-circuit (SC), and bypass diode SC types. These fault types are implemented on a 300-W (5&#215;3) PV array system and their MVs are obtained and analyzed. The obtained results are found to be satisfactory in nature and proposed methodology can be implemented in a wide range of the PV system.</description></item><item><title>Toward the Development of an Empirical Model of Air Pollution Impact on Solar PV Output for Industry Use</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269722</link><description>The absence of practical models for estimating the impact of air pollution on solar output presents a challenge for forecasting of solar electricity production and creates more uncertainty for financing and insuring solar plants. While the physics of irradiance attenuation due to aerosols are well understood, complex atmospheric conditions and lack of detailed atmospheric measurement make them impractical for industry or small-scale solar users to calculate its impact on PV power generation. Simple, empirical models to quantify the overall effect from real-world observations are scarce. In this study, we make use of both the experimental approach as well as large-scale real-world observational data from more than 15 sites to empirically evaluate the impact of air pollution on PV production using only common weather parameters. We show that the impact of PM2.5 on irradiance and, hence, PV output is approximately linear at low and moderate levels of PM2.5, with a 100 &#956;g/m3 increase corresponding to a reduction of around 15 &#177; 5% relative under clear sky conditions, which is broadly consistent with previous preliminary results reported from literature. This effect saturates at higher PM2.5 concentrations beyond 300 &#956;g/m3 and is reduced at high cloud coverage. The methodology developed in this study represents a viable path towards establishing a common ground for standards. The results obtained are the most comprehensive so far in terms of breadth and depth among similar empirical studies using ground-based observations. They provide a basis for establishing a functional model for industry practitioners in the PV community.</description></item><item><title>Comparing Photovoltaic Power Prediction: Ground-Based Measurements vs. Satellite Data Using an ANN Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10251701</link><description>Accurate prediction of photovoltaic (PV) power output is crucial for assessing the feasibility of early-stage projects in relation to specific site weather conditions. While various mathematical models have been used in the past for PV power prediction, most of them only consider irradiance and ambient temperature, neglecting other important meteorological parameters. In this article, a 1-year dataset from a high-precision meteorological station at the Green Energy Research facility is utilized, along with electrical parameters from a polycrystalline silicon c-Si PV module exposed during the study period, to forecast PV power. In addition, the accuracy of using satellite data for PV power forecasting is investigated, considering the growing trend of its utilization in recent research. Regression techniques, such as linear regression with interaction, tree regression, Gaussian process regression, ensemble learning for regression, response surface methodology, SVM cubic, and artificial neural network (ANN), are employed for PV power prediction, using both ground measurement data and satellite data. Comparatively lower accuracies are observed when using satellite data across all regression methods, in contrast to the higher accuracies achieved with ground-based measurements. Notably, the Gaussian process regression method demonstrates high accuracy (R2 = 0.25 for satellite data and R2 = 0.94 for ground-based data). Furthermore, the ANN approach further enhances the accuracy of PV power forecasting, yielding R2 = 0.42 for satellite data and R2 = 0.96 for ground-based data. These findings emphasize the need for caution when relying on satellite data for PV power forecasting, even when employing advanced ANN approaches. It underscores the importance of considering ground-based measurements for more reliable and accurate predictions.</description></item><item><title>Thermal-Aware Fixed-Outline 3-D IC Floorplanning: An End-to-End Learning-Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278145</link><description>High temperature and temperature nonuniformity pose significant challenges in 3-D integrated circuits (3-D ICs). Numerous studies have explored thermal issues in 3-D IC floorplanning. However, most existing handcrafted heuristic algorithms suffer from long iteration cycles, resulting in inefficient thermal management and no guarantee of optimal performance. In addition, with the increasing complexity of modern integrated circuit design, current floorplanning techniques encounter the &#8220;curse of dimensionality&#8221; and struggle to optimize large-scale cases. To address these challenges, this article proposes a novel end-to-end learning-based approach for thermal-aware fixed-outline 3-D IC floorplanning. In the tier assignment stage, we utilize a deep  ${k}$ -means clustering algorithm to allocate modules to different tiers, aiming to achieve an improved cross-tier power distribution. In the global distribution (GD) stage, we formulate the floorplanning problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). By combining graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm, we optimize the positions of modules and through-silicon vias (TSVs), while incorporating an attention mechanism in the centralized critic to enhance cooperation among agents. Finally, in the TSV assignment (TA) stage, we refine the TSV positions using the MADRL algorithm, further reducing wirelength and temperature in 3-D ICs. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art heuristic-based 3-D IC floorplanner in terms of wirelength and temperature optimization.</description></item><item><title>Impact of 3-D Integration on Thermal Performance of RISC-V MemPool Multicore SOC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10261872</link><description>Due to the rise in the number of cores in modern multicore architectures, 3-D integration (i.e., vertical stacking of chips) of system-on-a-chip (SOC) promises better performance due to a drastic reduction in global interconnect lengths and die footprint compared with 2-D counterparts. However, thermal issues are predominant in 3-D-SOCs due to the vertical stacking nature of chips which multiplies the transistor power density by the number of dies within the stack. Also, the reduced lateral heat spreading with aggressive die thinning degrades the ON-chip thermal performances. In this article, we investigate the thermal performance analysis of 3-D-SOC and compare the results with the 2-D-SOC designs for a MemPool multicore SOC with shared L1 scratchpad memory (SPM). Simulation results reveal that the 3-D-SOC using memory-on-logic (MOL) configuration increases the ON-chip maximum temperature by more than 20% compared with the baseline 2-D-SOC and the logic die temperature is relatively higher (3.6%) than the memory die. We also explore the impact of architectural floor-planning effects and 3-D functional partitioning on thermal performance of the MemPool instances in the 3-D-SOC with memory capacity ranging from 1 to 8 MiB and benchmarked the thermal performance with the 2-D-SOC designs. We observe that the junction-to-ambient temperature ( $T_{\max }$ ) increases by 44% and is predominant for the SPM capacity of 8 MiB. Further investigations on various 3-D stacking configurations reveal there is an improvement in thermal performance for MOL over logic-on-memory (LOM) for L1 SPM capacity of 1, 2, and 4 MiB, and LOM over the MOL configuration for L1 SPM capacity of 8 MiB.</description></item><item><title>Behavioral Model for High-Speed SAR ADCs With On-Chip References</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278146</link><description>This article proposes a behavioral model, based on closed-form equations, of the dynamic errors in high-speed high-accuracy successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with charge-redistribution capacitor-based digital-to-analog converters (CDACs). To deal with incomplete settling of references and overcoming  $LC$  package parasitics, on-chip generation of the references must be considered in high-performance applications. This architecture, in combination with a bit-redundant conversion scheme, improves conversion speed while relaxing power consumption. The main challenge in this approach is that the reference settling and the resulting redundancy tolerance are signal-dependent, not only on the current error magnitude but also on the previous conversion cycle history and parasitics. This requires costly postlayout transistor-level simulations for performance evaluation (in the order of days), making not always feasible a systematic exploration of design space before integration due to computation time. To overcome this bottleneck, this work will show that the dynamic behavior can be theoretically predicted using a time-varying effective reference, the behavior of which is analytically described compactly. The accuracy of the proposed dynamic model is verified with a comparison with a 1.2-V 13-bit 65-nm SAR ADC characterized between 10 and 60 Msps at the postlayout level.</description></item><item><title>A 1-GS/s 12-bit Single-Channel Pipelined ADC in 28-nm CMOS With Input-Split Fully Differential Ring Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286528</link><description>This article proposed a deep-pipelined analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that utilizes an input-split fully differential ring amplifier (ringamp, RAMP). The implemented ringamp is optimized for speed, achieving a higher nondominant pole frequency, and exhibits excellent adaptability in low-voltage, deep-nanoscale advanced CMOS processes. To minimize nonoverlap time, a nonoverlapping optimized clock generator is employed, generating two-phase and nonoverlapping clocks with near 50% duty cycles for sampling and amplification in the multiplying digital-to-analog converters (MDACs). The ADC architecture comprises a high-linearity input buffer, ten MDACs, and a flash backend ADC. To enhance linearity, a dither signal is injected in the first three stages. Fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, the 1-GS/s 12-bit ADC based on the ringamp achieves a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 70.34 dB and a signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 55.71 dB at Nyquist input, while consuming only 38.9 mW from a single 1-V supply. This translates to a Walden figure of merit (FoM) of 75 fJ/conversion step and a Schreier FoM of 157.2 dB, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Noise Area-Efficient Column-Parallel ADC With an Input Triplet for a 120-dB High Dynamic Range CMOS Image Sensor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10287277</link><description>This article presents and demonstrates the design of a high dynamic range (HDR) CMOS image sensor (CIS). Detailed operation of various comparator circuits is analyzed. A low-noise, area-efficient, wide-input range comparator is proposed for HDR applications. Based on the analysis, a six-transistor (6T) comparator is proposed with a p-type metal oxide semiconductor (PMOS) input triplet, which effectively increases the input range of a conventional PMOS-input type comparator and compensates the charge injection and kT/C noise introduced from pixels switching between high-conversion-gain (HCG) and low-conversion-gain (LCG) modes. The proposed scheme achieves an extra high dynamic range (DR). A full HD ( $1920\times1080$ ) HDR image sensor with  $2.9 ~\mu \text{m}$  pixel pitches is fabricated in a 55 nm one-ploy five-metal (1P5M) CIS process.

The novelty of our pseudoflash-based Digital LDO (PFD-LDO) voltage regulator lies in the fact that we use pseudoflash (or alternately, flash) transistor subarrays for voltage regulation. By changing the threshold voltage (and thereby, the ON resistance) of these transistors, we can use the same design to meet different regulator specifications. The threshold voltage can be programed either at the factory by the manufacturer or in the field by the user. This gives the manufacturer the ability to offer a family of LDO regulators with a single design, a significant economic advantage. In addition, aging effects and temperature variations are effectively erased since the threshold voltage of the pseudoflash (or flash) transistors can be tuned to a fine degree in the field. Similarly, process variations can be canceled after manufacturing in the factory. These advantages are absent in traditional LDO regulators. Our design uses two subarrays. A coarse subarray is used to reduce the recovery time and output voltage overshoot/undershoot, while a fine subarray regulates the output voltage, minimizing the output voltage ripple. Unlike state-of-the-art LDO regulators, our design can realize multiple specifications with the same circuit. For example, we demonstrate that the  $V_{\mathrm{ out}}$  of the proposed PFD-LDO regulator can range from 0.7 to  $1.7 {V}$  when the supply voltage  $V_{\mathrm{ IN}}$  ranges from 0.8 to  $1.8 {V}$ , using the same circuit design. Over this voltage range, the proposed PFD-LDO regulator achieves  $V_{\mathrm{ shoot}}&lt; 573 \text {mV}$ ,  $t_{\mathrm{ rec}}&lt; 0.50 \mu \text {s}$ , and  $V_{\mathrm{ ripple}}&lt; 7.4 \text {mV}$  when the  $I_{\max }$  ranges from 15 to 250 mA.</description></item><item><title>A 55-nm Three-Stage Operational Transconductance Amplifier With Single Cascode Miller Compensation for Large Capacitive Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296839</link><description>With the scaling down of the transistor technology, intrinsic gains of the devices are continuously dropping. Meanwhile, high-gain operational transconductance amplifiers (OTAs) using technologies with reduced feature sizes are required in various applications. This article presents a 55-nm-fabricated three-stage OTA with a single cascode Miller capacitor for driving large capacitive loads. To achieve a high dc gain, a gain enhancement (GE) circuit is used in the first stage to boost the overall voltage gain to above 100 dB. To obtain a stable frequency response, a cascode Miller compensation scheme together with the GE circuits are used to push the nondominant complex pole to higher frequency and adjust the  $Q$ -factor. The proposed three-stage OTA is implemented in a 55-nm low-power (LP) CMOS process and occupies an area of 0.005 mm2. A current consumption of  $157 \mu \text{A}$  can be measured with a supply voltage of 1.2 V. The measured results show that this three-stage OTA can achieve stable frequency and transient step responses when driving 2.5-to-30-nF capacitive loads. With a 15-nF capacitive load, a gain bandwidth (GBW) of 0.82 MHz, a phase margin (PM) of 53&#176;, an average slew rate of 0.13 V/ $\mu \text{s}$ , and an average 1% settling time of  $2.62 \mu \text{s}$  can be achieved.</description></item><item><title>A 40-nm 1.89-pJ/SOP Scalable Convolutional Spiking Neural Network Learning Core With On-Chip Spatiotemporal Back-Propagation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10310163</link><description>In recent years, progress in spiking neural network (SNN) research has generated growing interest in specialized SNN hardware. However, most of the hardware studies are about inference-only engines, and the training process for low-power endpoint devices remains arduous due to high numerical precision requirements. In this article, we introduce a scalable convolutional SNN learning core for energy-efficient training utilizing the spatiotemporal back-propagation (STBP) algorithm. We modify the STBP algorithm with five hardware-based enhancing methods, which minimize the hardware implementation cost without losing accuracy. We propose a unified core architecture encompassing three data-flow modes for three training phases. It also offers multicore scalability for wider and deeper models. A 40-nm prototype chip has been implemented, achieving peak training and inference efficiencies of 3 and 7.7 TOPS/W, respectively, at 90% input sparsity and an energy per synaptic operation (SOP) metric of 1.89 pJ/SOP. Based on the chip, our multicore prototype system attains a competitive accuracy of 99.1% on MNIST. We also exhibit the first on-chip training results on SVHN and CIFAR10, with an average of  $36\times $  improvement in efficiency compared with a typical commercial GPU platform.</description></item><item><title>An Optimized Low-Power VLSI Architecture for ECG/VCG Data Compression for IoHT Wearable Device Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273851</link><description>Continuous monitoring of the electrical activity of heart signals using wearable Internet of Healthcare Things (IoHTs) devices plays a crucial role in decreasing mortality rates. However, this continuous monitoring using an electrocardiogram (ECG) or vectorcardiogram (VCG) generates huge clinical data. Moreover, these devices are constrained in terms of ON-chip storage, data transmission capacity, and power. Thus, handling a large amount of data is difficult with these devices, making it necessary to compress these data for storage and transmission. Lossless or near-lossless data compression solves this problem, ensuring that no relevant physiological/clinical information is lost in the compression process. Therefore, low-power, resource-efficient, and lossless VLSI architectures are proposed in this article to compress multichannel ECG/VCG data. The designs are tested using the PTB database for both ECG and VCG data and can achieve compression ratios (CRs) of 3.857 and 4.45 with minimal power and area requirements making them suitable for low-power wearable healthcare devices.</description></item><item><title>Power-Aware Neuromorphic Architecture With Partial Voltage Scaling 3-D Stacking Synaptic Memory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10269541</link><description>The combination of neuromorphic computing (NC) and 3-D integrated circuits - the 3-D stacking neuromorphic system can be the most advanced architecture that inherits the benefits of both computing and interconnect paradigms. However, simply shifting to the third dimension cannot exploit the 3-D structure and also end up with a low yield rate issue. Therefore, in this article, we propose a methodology to design 3-D stacking synaptic memory for power-efficient operations and yield rate improvement of neuromorphic systems. In this proposed methodology, the synaptic weights are stacked on top of the processing elements (PEs), and these weights are split into multiple subsets placed in different layers. Furthermore, with the support of 3-D technology, the supply voltage of each layer can be controlled independently which leads to power reduction by scaling down or turning off the supply voltage of the memory layer(s) containing the least significant bits (LSBs) while maintaining acceptable accuracy. On top of that, this work also proposes a methodology to deal with the low yield rate issue by treating the defective memory cells as noises. In our evaluation with the CMOS 45 nm technology, the energy per synaptic operation (SOP) for MNIST classification, when undervolting two upper memory layers (from 1.1 to 0.8 V), reduces by 21.62% while the accuracy only reduces sightly by 0.51%. This energy reduction increases to 66.77% with 6.58% accuracy loss when our system uses both power-gating and undervolting for all memory layers. Furthermore, the system can also improve the yield rate by 0.18% or 12.4% while suffering 0.38% or 1.7% of accuracy loss, respectively.</description></item><item><title>TensorCache: Reconstructing Memory Architecture With SRAM-Based In-Cache Computing for Efficient Tensor Computations in GPGPUs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10308729</link><description>General purpose graphics processing units (GPGPUs) have emerged as a convincing and pivotal computing platform for deep learning applications. However, the fundamental tensor computations for neural networks on GPGPUs are still restricted by the von Neumann bottleneck. The memory bandwidth and energy consumption of moving a large amount of neural network data between the memory hierarchy and computational units of GPGPUs dominate the overall computational cost. To address these challenges, this article proposes TensorCache to reconstruct memory architecture with static random-access memory (SRAM)-based In-Cache Computing for efficient tensor computations in GPGPUs. It provides an innovative digital SRAM processing-in-memory (PIM) solution by transforming the cache array into large-scale PIM units, effectively mitigating the significant performance and energy consumption losses caused by data movement. To enable efficient hardware-software co-design for TensorCache, a decoupled architecture-based SRAM-PIM macro (SPM) is introduced at the hardware level, supporting in-memory bit-parallel comparison (IMBC) and near-memory radix-4 booth encoder (NRBE) for efficient mixed-precision floating-point (FP) tensor computations. At the software level, a programming model leveraging the GPGPU&#8217;s flexible programmability is proposed to bridge the gap between application demands and mismatched hardware/software interfaces. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that TensorCache achieves up to  $38.59\times $  speedup and  $16.26\times $  throughput enhancement compared to GPU CUDA Cores. Furthermore, it attains an acceleration of up to  $1.78\times $  and  $3.87\times $  throughput improvement compared to GPU Tensor Cores, while saving power consumption in tensor computations by over 90% with a mere 21% chip area overhead.</description></item><item><title>A 40-nm SONOS Digital CIM Using Simplified LUT Multiplier and Continuous Sample-Hold Sense Amplifier for AI Edge Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10271245</link><description>Digital computing in memory (CIM) exhibits high precision as well as high energy efficiency (EE) yet still lacks discussion in nonvolatile memory (NVM).

However, existing IMC architectures rely on the area and power-hungry analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for sensing the current, diminishing all the benefits of RRAM. Also, enhancing memory density is essential for implementing compact and efficient artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Implementing multiple states in a single memory cell decreases the resistance between states, making it difficult to sense the current. Thus, incorporating ADCs in multilevel cells (MLCs) further increases the design cost. This article proposes an ADC-less reprogrammable RRAM-based IMC architecture. The ADC-less sensing scheme converts the RRAM array current into its digital equivalent. The proposed scheme can distinguish RRAM resistive states equivalent to 4-bit/cell with a minimal resistance margin of 0.3  $\text{K}\Omega $  between two consecutive states. It is realized with only 12 transistors, the least among the state-of-the-art designs used in IMC architectures. This article also presents an MLC programming method, resulting in a 22% cycle-to-cycle and device-to-device variation-tolerant design with an average power consumption of  $21.5 ~\mu \text{W}$ , which is 60.18% less than the contemporary IMC architectures. Furthermore, the proposed current sensor (CS) requires only 12 transistors which is the least among the state-of-the-art works.</description></item><item><title>RMC_NoC: A Reliable On-Chip Network Architecture With Reconfigurable Multifunctional Channel</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286455</link><description>As chip fabrication has advanced to the nano level, the increased link density has heightened the risk of failures. The potential performance drawbacks resulting from these link failures have become a critical challenge in the design of reliable network-on-chip (NoC) systems. Fault-tolerant routing algorithms have proven to be effective strategies for handling this issue by diverting packets away from failed links to prevent congestion. However, these algorithms often result in excessive packet diversion, especially in the presence of a higher failure rate, which can significantly constrain the network&#8217;s behavior. This article introduces a novel NoC design with reconfigurable multifunctional channels (RMC_NoC). This design dynamically adapts the channel functions in response to network conditions to ensure that packets from failed links follow their original paths. In addition, it presents a channel buffer bubble flow control mechanism that can resolve congestion by redistributing congested traffic within the channel buffer. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach ensures superior network communication even in the presence of permanent link failures, with minimal area overhead and power consumption. Moreover, our system exhibits lower latency and higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art fault-tolerant methods across various link failure rates. Notably, even at a severe failure rate of 30%, RMC_NoC exhibits only a 16.3% increase in latency compared to an ideal failure-free environment (Baseline) while still maintaining system communication capabilities to a considerable extent.</description></item><item><title>PERA: Power-Efficient Routing Architecture for SRAM-Based FPGAs in Dark Silicon Era</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273211</link><description>The ever-increasing rate of static power consumption in nanoscale technologies, and consequently, the breakdown of Dennard scaling acts as a power wall for further device scaling. With intensified power density, designers are forced to selectively power off portions of chip area, known as dark silicon. With significant power consumption of routing resources in the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and their low utilization rate, power gating of unused routing resources can be used to reduce the overall device power consumption. While power gating has taken great attention, previous studies neglect major factors that affect the effectiveness of power gating, for example, routing architecture, topology, and technology. In this article, we propose a power-efficient routing architecture (PERA) for SRAM-based FPGAs, which is designed pursuant to the utilization pattern of routing resources with different topologies. PERA is applicable to different granularity from a multiplexer to a switch-matrix (SM) level. We examine the efficiency of the proposed architecture with different topologies, structures, and parameters of routing resources. We further propose a routing algorithm to reduce the scattered use of resources and hence to take advantage of opportunities of power gating in routing resources. Our experiments using a versatile place and route (VPR) toolset on the FPGA architecture similar to commercial chips over an extensive set of circuits from Microelectronics Center of North Carolina (MCNC), International Workshop on Logic Synthesis (IWLS), Verilog to routing (VTR), and Titan benchmarks indicate that PERA reduces the static power consumption by 43.3%. This improvement is obtained at the expense of 7.4% area overhead. PERA along with the optimized routing algorithm offers a total routing leakage power reduction of up to 64.9% when compared to nonpower-gating architectures and 6.9% when compared with the conventional routing algorithm across all benchmark circuits and architectures with various wire segment lengths. This is while the optimized routing algorithm degrades performance by only less than 3%.</description></item><item><title>Reducing Power Dissipation in Memory Repair for High Fault Rates</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10328929</link><description>Nanometric scaling steadily increases failure rates, which are particularly acute for ultimate complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) and post-CMOS devices. We previously established an ECC-based method of memory repair that dramatically reduced the cost for high fault rates, and in this article, we establish a repair architecture that further reduces the power cost. Since CAMs are power hungry (as the address of each memory operation is compared with all the tag fields), we use a cache with the following innovations: 1) innovative repair architecture: although a direct-mapped cache and a set-associative cache that employs offset address bits are efficient for performance of CPUs, we show that they are inefficient for memory repair, since the characteristics of the memory words that need to be replaced in memory repair are different from the case of CPUs, and hence, rather than using any of these cache architectures, we establish an innovative memory repair method that uses another cache and an overflow block; 2) this architecture is thousand times more efficient than other approaches to memory repair based on a CAM or cache; 3) we present a yield computation that determines the size of each block of this repair architecture that is needed to achieve any target yield, and we establish this using a novel probabilistic approach, mathematical approaches and algorithms; and 4) at high fault rates, the yield computation is intractable; we make it tractable via an innovative recursive mathematical approach that significantly reduces the number of operations.</description></item><item><title>A 5-mm2, 4.7-&#956;W Convolutional Neural Network Layer Accelerator for Miniature Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292613</link><description>This brief presents an energy-efficient accelerator for convolutional neural network (CNN) layer computations in a compact system.

Benefiting from the fine quantification in the time domain, the power-to-noise requirement of a comparator and speed limitation in the voltage domain have been significantly relaxed. An efficient cross-coupled linearized technique (CCLT) is proposed in a dynamic voltage-to-time converter (VTC) design as a crucial part of this ADC. This technique helps improve the total harmonic distortion (THD) of VTC by 8 dB across most process&#8211;voltage&#8211;temperature (PVT) variations by avoiding using a power-harvest current-source (CS)-based VTC. Moreover, a dynamic conversion strategy is proposed in a time quantizer to build a more power-efficient design. Fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, the prototype ADC consumes 3.3 mW at 1-V supply with an active area of 0.0035 mm2. With a Nyquist input, it achieves a signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) and spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 45.4 and 60.3 dB, respectively, yielding a Walden figure of merit (FoMW) of 14.4 fJ/conversion-step.</description></item><item><title>A Temperature Compensated Ring Oscillator With LC-Based Period Error Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10284912</link><description>This brief presents a hybrid oscillator architecture that combines an  $LC$  resonator and an inverter-based ring oscillator to exploit the inherent benefit of an  $LC$  resonator for frequency accuracy with low power consumption.

An 8-way serial-combining transformer (SCT) power combiner is employed to achieve 4.1 W (36.1 dBm) peak output power. IQ-reuse and transformer-based Doherty techniques are adopted to enhance the efficiency at 3 and 6 dB power back-offs (PBOs). Implemented in 28 nm CMOS and powered by 1.1 and 2.2 V supply voltages, this quadrature DPA achieves &gt;30% peak power-added efficiency (PAE) across 2.7&#8211;3.2 GHz and its 1 dB radio frequency (RF) bandwidth ranges from 2.6 to 3.2 GHz. Besides, it obtains the PAE of 25.3% and 22.6% at 6 and 3 dB PBOs, respectively. For long term evolution (LTE) 20 MHz 64 quadratic amplitude modulation (QAM) signal, this DPA achieves 29.4 dBm average output power, 18.5% average PAE at &#8722;25 dB error vector magnitude (EVM) limit, and it realizes almost 60 dB dynamic power range from &#8722;30 to 29.4 dBm with EVM below &#8722;25 dB at 2.9 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Spur and Low-Jitter Fractional-N Digital PLL Based on an Inverse-Constant-Slope DTC and FCW Subtractive Dithering</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10253943</link><description>This work presents a low-spur and low-jitter fractional- $N$  digital phase-locked loop (PLL). To reduce the fractional spurs caused by the non-linearity of the digital-to-time converter (DTC), two novel solutions are introduced. First, the inverse-constant-slope DTC achieves high-linearity, thanks to its immunity to channel-length modulation and non-linear parasitic capacitances. Second, the frequency-control-word (FCW) subtractive dithering technique randomizes the quantization error of the  $\Delta \Sigma $  modulator driving the PLL divider ratio without requiring an increased DTC dynamic range and pushing the fractional spurs outside the PLL bandwidth. The prototype, implemented in a 28-nm CMOS process, has an active area of 0.33 mm2 and dissipates 17.2 mW. At fractional- $N$  channels near 9.25 GHz, the measured in-band fractional spurs and the rms jitter are below &#8722;70 dBc and 77 fs, respectively, leading to a jitter-power figure of merit of &#8722;249.9 dB.</description></item><item><title>A Wideband LO Generator for 5G FR1 Bands Using a Single LC-VCO-Based Subsampling PLL and a Ring-VCO-Based Fractional-Resolution Frequency Multiplier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278174</link><description>In this work, an ultra-low -jitter wideband cascaded local oscillation (LO) generator for 5G frequency range 1 (FR1) is presented. Using the phase-rotating divider (PRD) of the 2nd-stage ring-oscillator-based frequency multiplier (RO-FM) that can generate fractional multiplication factors ( ${M}\text{s}$ ), the required frequency-tuning range (FTR) of the 1st-stage phase-locked loop (PLL) dramatically decreased to 21%, which can be covered easily by a single low-phase-noise LC -voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). Thus, the proposed LO generator can cover entire FR1 bands using only one LC tank. To suppress the fractional spurs caused by the mismatches of the delay cells of an RO, an individual-delay-cell-controllable digital loop filter (IDC-DLF) was used to calibrate the mismatches. Since the IDC-DLF equalizes the intervals between the quadrature signals of the RO, it can also naturally guarantee a precise quadrature relationship without any additional calibration. The 1st-stage PLL was designed based on a subsampling architecture, and it used a digital-to-analog converter (DAC)-based quantization error ( ${Q}$ -error) cancellation, dual-clock-phase generator, and a third-order curve fitting digital predistortion (TCF-DPD) to achieve ultra-low phase noise. The proposed LO generator was fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, and it used the power of 17.9 mW and the area of 0.64 mm2. The rms jitter, measured near 7.675 GHz ( $M = 4.25$ ), was 135 fs, and the calculated  ${I}/{Q}$  phase error from the fractional spur level was 0.16&#176;.</description></item><item><title>A Third-Order Quasi-Elliptic N-Path Filter With Enhanced Linearity Through Clock Boosting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10286543</link><description>N-path filters show promise to realize tunable, high-quality on-chip filters. However, N-path filters remain restricted to sub-2 GHz operation, low frequency selectivity, and  ${\approx }0$  dBm power handling. We circumvent these issues through: 1) the concept of frequency-translational higher order N-path filters that uses baseband/intermediary-frequency nodes/resonators to break the trade-off between operating frequency and loss/power consumption; 2) a new complementary Nakagome-charge-pump-based clock booster circuit to enhance the power handling of the N-path filters; and 3) the usage of N-phase paths with overlapping local oscillator (LO&#8217;s) to enable a higher frequency of operation. When combined, these innovations have resulted in a higher order N-path band-pass filter that emulates the transmission profile of a third order elliptical bandpass filter (BPF) with two shunt resonators and two series resonators. Our prototype was implemented in a standard 65 nm CMOS process and operates across a wide frequency range of 1&#8211;5 GHz ( ${&gt;}4 \times $  better than prior works). Measurements resulted in +8.8 dBm in-band  $IP_{1\text {dB}}$ , +23 dBm in-band IIP3, +9.3 dBm out-of-band (OOB)  $B_{1\text {dB}}$ , +36 dBm OOB IIP3, +15 dB selectivity one bandwidth away, and +24 dB OOB rejection at far out frequencies.</description></item><item><title>A 128-Gb/s D-Band Receiver With Integrated PLL and ADC Achieving 1.95-pJ/b Efficiency in 22-nm FinFET</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10273376</link><description>This work presents a  ${D}$ -band (110&#8211;170 GHz) receiver (RX) with integrated analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and phase-locked loop (PLL).

Since the available solar cell area limits the power generation of the small LEO satellites, a distributed current-sharing common-gate (CG) low noise amplifier (LNA) and a voltage-tuning variable gain amplifier (VGA) are introduced to reduce power consumption. After utilizing the proposed technique, the power consumption of the beamformer is 2.95 mW/element. Moreover, the proposed voltage-tuning VGA is configured to utilize both upper and lower transistors for gain contributions to save power. The ON-chip distributed radiation sensors are presented to eliminate the non-uniform radiation influence and realize 0.22-dB/Mrad gain degradation performance.

To avoid the extra headroom required by conventional current sources, the sensor&#8217;s diode-connected BJTs are biased by precharging sampling capacitors to the supply voltage and then discharging them through the BJTs. This capacitive biasing technique requires little headroom ( $\sim $ 150 mV), and simultaneously samples the BJTs&#8217; base&#8211;emitter voltages. The latter are then applied to a switched-capacitor (SC)  $\Delta \Sigma $  ADC to generate a digital representation of temperature. For robust sub-1 V operation and high energy efficiency, the ADC employs auto-zeroed inverter-based integrators. Fabricated in a standard 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  CMOS process, the sensor occupies 0.25 mm2 and consumes 810 nW from a 0.95-V supply at room temperature. It achieves an inaccuracy of &#177;0.15 &#176;C (3 $\sigma $ ) from &#8722;55 &#176;C to 125 &#176;C after a 1-point trim, which is at par with the state-of-the-art.

Pick-up coils and Hall plates are employed to sense the high and low-frequency fields, respectively, generated by a current-carrying conductor. Due to the differentiating characteristic of the pick-up coils, a flat frequency response can then be obtained by summing the outputs of the coil and the Hall paths and passing the result through a 1st-order low-pass filter (LPF). For maximum resolution, the LPF corner frequency (2 kHz) is set such that the noise contribution of each path is equal. To suppress the coil-path offset without the use of large ac coupling capacitors, an area-efficient dual dc servo loop (D3SL) is used. This effectively suppresses the coil-path offset, resulting in a total offset of 73  $\mu \text{T}$ , which is mainly dominated by the Hall path. Fabricated in a standard 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  CMOS process, the current sensor occupies 3.9 mm2 and draws 7.1 mA from a 1.8 V supply. It achieves 43 mA resolution in a 5 MHz bandwidth, which is 1.5 $\times $  better than the state-of-the-art hybrid sensors. It also achieves the lowest energy efficiency FoM (3.5 $\times $ ) among CMOS magnetic current sensors.</description></item><item><title>A Temperature- and Aging-Compensated RC Oscillator With &#177;1030-ppm Inaccuracy From40 &#176;C to 85 &#176;C After Accelerated Aging for 500 h at 125 &#176;C</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10278177</link><description>This article presents a temperature- and aging-compensated  $RC$  oscillator (TACO) in which the long-term drift of the main oscillator is compensated by periodically locking its frequency to that of the less-aged reference oscillator. To improve the long-term stability of the TACO, it employs techniques, such as the use of higher activation energy ( $E_{a}$ ) resistors, switched dual  $RC$  branches to mitigate stress from dc-current-induced electromigration (EM), and duty cycling to slow down the aging rate of the reference oscillator.

Compared with conventional resistive-feedback CDAs driven by resistive or current-steering DACs, the proposed architecture eliminates the noise from the DAC and feedback resistors. Intermodulation between the chopping, pulsewidth modulation (PWM), and DAC sampling frequency is analyzed to avoid negative impacts on the DR and linearity. Real-time dynamic element matching (RTDEM) is employed to address distortion due to mismatch in the DAC, while its intersymbol interference (ISI) is eliminated by deadbanding.

To address such, this article presents a condition-adaptive  $\Delta f^{3}$  EMI control for automotive power circuits, which coordinates integral spread-spectrum modulation (SSM) schemes to regulate EMI adaptively in response to drastic condition changes of input voltage  $V_{\mathrm {IN}}$  and load current  $I_{\mathrm {LOAD}}$ . Specifically, a  $\Delta f_{\mathrm {SW,UP/DN}}$  spread control technique steers the  $\Delta f_{\mathrm {SW}}$  spread direction according to  $V_{\mathrm {IN}}$ , while a  $\Delta f_{\mathrm {SW}}$  spread range modulation scheme adjusts the  $\Delta f_{\mathrm {SW}}$  range according to  $I_{\mathrm {LOAD}}$ . Meanwhile, a  $\Delta f_{\mathrm {SW}}$  adaptive multi-rate (MR) SSM scheme prevents spectrum overlap spikes. With the three distinct  $\Delta f_{\mathrm {SW}}$ -focused control modules working cohesively, we name the overall EMI control as the  $\Delta f^{3}$  EMI control in this work. In addition, to avoid high-energy EMI from entering the audible frequency range, a modulation frequency  $f_{M}$  envelope tracking scheme is also developed. Demonstrated in an automotive-use GaN switching power converter, this work was fabricated using a 180-nm HV BCD process. It auto-extends  $\Delta f_{\mathrm {SW}}$  from 10% to 32% and reduces EMI by 17.2 dB to counteract  $I_{\mathrm {LOAD}}$  elevation from 200 mA to 1 A. Meanwhile, it can down-spread  $f_{\mathrm {SW}}$  adaptively by the MR-SSM with a 16.3 dB reduction in response to a  $V_{\mathrm {IN}}$  increase from 12 V to 24 V without causing overlap spikes.</description></item><item><title>A 12-to-1 V Quad-Output Switched-Capacitor Buck Converter With Shared DC Capacitors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214655</link><description>This article presents a 12-to-1 V quad-output switched-capacitor buck (SCB) converter with shared dc capacitors ( $C_{\mathrm {DC}}\text{s}$ ). First, we proposed single-output SCB achieving a high efficiency, with small switch area and small inductor volume under several-ampere conditions. Each single-output SCB has two  $C_{\mathrm {DC}}\text{s}$ . Second, based on the single-output SCB, we proposed multiple-output SCB converter that shares the two  $C_{\mathrm {DC}}\text{s}$  among the channels. The  $C_{\mathrm {DC}}$ -sharing improves the power density and efficiency under unequal-load conditions. Third, we eliminate cross-regulation in a conventional energy-store-device-sharing topology through current mode (CM) control. Besides, we use a capacitor-sourced gate drive scheme that is highly compatible with the SCB, removing the bootstrap and gate drive supply voltage generation circuits. Fabricated in a 180-nm BCD process, this design achieves a measured peak efficiency of 90.4%, and 48 mA/mm3 power density with 85% efficiency. To our best knowledge, this is one of the first 12-to-1 V integrated hybrid converter with multiple outputs reported.</description></item><item><title>A Reconfigurable Single-Inductor Multi-Stage Hybrid Converter for 1-Cell Battery Chargers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225341</link><description>This article presents a reconfigurable single-inductor multi-stage (SIMS) hybrid step-down converter that efficiently provides a wide range of voltage conversion ratios (VCRs) needed for 1-cell battery charging across a wide input voltage range of 5&#8211;24 V while moving the inductor away from the high-output current path.

To improve the power extraction, various interface circuits using a flip process have been proposed, such as synchronized switch harvesting on inductor (SSHI) rectifier and synchronized switch harvesting on capacitor (SSHC) rectifier. The flip process reduces the influence of large  $C_{\text {P}}$  and the charge loss by using external elements. However, to extract high power, each rectifier requires a bulky inductor with a high quality factor (Q) and numerous external capacitors, respectively, which increases the system&#8217;s volume. Therefore, to solve the tradeoff issue between the extracted power and the volume of the system, this article proposes a scalable N-step equally split synchronized-switch harvesting-on-inductor (ES-SSHI) rectifier. By splitting the flip process into equal N-step, the ES-SSHI rectifier reduces an inductor RMS current and conduction loss. Moreover, the duty signals of each split phase are regular and symmetric, which enables a single controller to generate multiple flip duty signals and allows for predicting the zero-crossing point of the inductor current, ultimately reducing the controller loss. The proposed system was fabricated in the 180-nm CMOS process. The measured results demonstrate that the proposed ES-SSHI rectifier achieves a power extraction improvement of 1170% over the full-bridge rectifier (FBR) even with a subcubic millimeter scale low-Q inductor, reducing the system&#8217;s volume.</description></item><item><title>A Modular Switched-Capacitor Chip-Stacking Drive Platform for kV-Level Electrostatic Actuators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10238461</link><description>This work presents a switched-capacitor (SC) actuator driver implemented in 180-nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) CMOS that uses multi-chip stacking to extend drive voltages beyond the process limits of a single chip. Building on past work, the SC stage uses a modified series&#8211;parallel architecture to step the actuator drive voltage sequentially, reducing hard-charging losses and recovering energy stored in the bulk dielectric of representative piezoelectric and other electrostatic transducers. The design uses an auxiliary (inductor-based) boost converter in the first chip to interface with low-voltage primary battery inputs while providing regulation. Multi-chip stacking allows modularity and scalability to kV-level drive voltages with low-voltage control signals relayed through a floating daisy-chain network. With a single chip using  $\mathrm { &lt; }5$ - $\mathrm {\mu }\text{A}$  quiescent current, the design provides voltage conversion ratios (VCRs)  $\mathrm {&gt;} 100$ , converting 3.7-V inputs to over 400 Vpp. In a demonstration with eight chips stacked in a miniaturized interposer platform, the design can convert 2.5&#8211;5-V inputs to 3 kVpp (VCR &gt; 1000), delivering 1-W reactive power with over 97% efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Level Boost Converter With Fully State-Based Phase Selection Technique for High-Speed VCF Calibration and Smooth Mode Transition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10226256</link><description>In this article, a three-level current-mode boost converter with a fully state-based phase selection (FSPS) technique is presented. The proposed FSPS technique selects the operation phase adaptively to ensure the voltage across the flying capacitor ( $V_{\mathrm {CF}}$ ) to  $V_{O}$ /2 and changes the operation mode of a three-level boost converter (3L-BST). It enables the flying capacitor to be charged or discharged consecutively at the same duties every switching period and the operation mode to be changed smoothly. Therefore, 3L-BST improves the  $V_{\mathrm {CF}}$  calibration speed with the stable startup and removes the sub-harmonic oscillation of the inductor current caused by the  $V_{\mathrm {CF}}$  calibration, and the output voltage fluctuation is alleviated in the mode transition region. In addition, to compensate the stability of both valley and peak current-mode control for a wide output voltage range, the proposed FSPS technique adopts the adaptive slope generator (ASG) of which the slope can be changed from negative to positive. This work, fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) process, occupies an area of 5.51 mm2. The peak efficiency of the proposed 3L-BST is 95.3%, with an input range of 2&#8211;6 V, an output range of 5&#8211;32 V, and a 0.5-A maximum load current. The inductor current ripples are  $1.45\times $  smaller than prior  $V_{\mathrm {CF}}$  calibration techniques. The total startup time is  $490~\mu \text{s}$ .</description></item><item><title>A Rail-to-Rail 12 MS/s 91.3 dB SNDR 94.1 dB DR Two-Step SAR ADC With Integrated Input Buffer Using Predictive Level-Shifting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10250953</link><description>Input buffers can be used to reduce the input load of high-resolution discrete-time (DT) Nyquist analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), which can be challenging to drive, particularly at high sampling rates, because of the large input sampling capacitance needed to reduce thermal noise. An input driving technique called predictive level-shifting is proposed to drive rail-to-rail signal swing without increasing the buffer supply rail for high linearity. This article demonstrates an easy-to-drive two-step successive approximation register (SAR) ADC with integrated input buffer, achieving 91.3 dB peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and 94.1 dB dynamic range (DR) with 6.6 V peak-to-peak differential signal swing and 4 MHz input frequency at 12 MS/s with 30.41 mW power consumption, demonstrating the best performance among the published literature.</description></item><item><title>A Second-Order NS Pipelined SAR ADC With Quantization-Prediction-Unrolled Gain Error Shaping and Fully Passive Integrator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10238424</link><description>This article presents a second-order noise shaping (NS) pipelined successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with fully passive NS and a second-order gain error shaping (GES) based on a Quantization-Prediction-Unrolled scheme. The GES is enabled by subtracting the residue voltage with a predicted quantization error through a second-order digital GES filter. Utilizing an auxiliary SAR ADC for the prediction retains an outstanding GES ability and avoids deteriorating the residue amplifier&#8217;s (RAs) linearity as in the conventional GES scheme. The NS also applies to the auxiliary SAR ADC to further ease the overhead from the GES techniques. Besides, a second-order fully passive NS SAR ADC is presented in the backend stage of the overall pipelined SAR architecture, which only calls for a single additional small-size input pair in the comparator, mitigating the noise penalty from the high-order passive NS scheme. Furthermore, a two-step floating inverter amplifier (FIA) is introduced, alleviating the severe gain variation over process-voltage-temperature (PVT) in the conventional one-step counterpart and eventually allowing the energy-efficient open-loop FIA to fit our architecture. With partial time interleaving, the ADC in a 28-nm CMOS process runs at 400 MS/s, achieving 25 MHz bandwidth and 77.2 dB nominal signal-to-noise-and-distortion-ratio (SNDR) with 8 $\times $  OSR. It consumes 2.03 mW power from a 1-V supply and exhibits a 178-dB Schreier figure-of-merit (FoMS). The SNDR of the ADC deviates less than 3-dB from the nominal performance within &#8722;24% to +18% gain error.</description></item><item><title>A 10-mW 10-ENoB 1-GS/s Ring-Amp-Based Pipelined TI-SAR ADC With Split MDAC and Switched Reference Decoupling Capacitor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10238425</link><description>This article presents a 12-bit 1-GS/s ring-amp-based analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with a pipelined and time-interleaved successive approximation register (TI-SAR) hybrid architecture. This architecture utilizes backend time-interleaving for power and design complexity reduction while eliminating the sampling time skew. A ring amplifier (ring-amp) is used in this architecture to significantly reduce the power of residue amplification by about ten times over a prior work. A high-speed PVT-robust ring-amp with split input by splitting the multiplying DAC (MDAC) is proposed to guarantee the performance of the ring-amp under low supply voltage. To improve the power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of the reference buffer and lower the reference noise without degrading the reference settling speed, a switched reference decoupling capacitor (de-cap) technique is proposed. Flash ADC and backend successive approximation register (SAR) ADCs are also optimized to meet the challenging power efficiency requirement. The ADC implemented in a 28-nm CMOS process achieves 62.5-dB SNDR for Nyquist input. The total power including the reference buffer is 10.6 mW, yielding a Schreier figure of merit ( $\text {FoM}_{S}$ ) of 169.2 dB.</description></item><item><title>A 52.5-dB 2&#215; Time-Interleaved 2.8-GS/s SAR ADC With 5-bit/Cycle Time-Domain Quantization and a Compact Signal DAC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10250903</link><description>This article presents a high-speed 5-bit/cycle successive-approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) facilitated by a linearized configurable voltage-to-time (V2T) buffer with time-domain (TD) quantization. Configuring the TD full-scale (TD-FS) input of the TD quantizer among cycles allows a single capacitive digital-to-analog converter (CDAC). The configuration is accomplished by the V2T buffer, which also provides isolation between the backend TD quantizer and CDAC, thus enabling over 3-GHz effective resolution bandwidth. The configurated FS also relieves the critical accuracy requirement in the TD quantizer due to the small residue voltage in the backend cycles, while the two-stage compensation scheme suppresses the nonlinearity from the V2T buffer. By incorporating 2 $\times $  time interleaving, the 28-nm prototype achieves a 2.8-GS/s sampling rate with a 51.79-dB signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) and 72.36-dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) at a Nyquist input while consuming only 18 mW under a 0.9-V supply, resulting in a Walden figure of merit (FoM) of 20.3 fJ/conversion-step.</description></item><item><title>APCCAS 2022 Guest Editorial Special Issue Based on the 18th Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10296105</link><description>The IEEE Asia Pacific Conference on Circuits and Systems (APCCAS) is the regional flagship conference of the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society (CASS) in Asia.

The proposed system inno-vatively extracts the Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficient (MFCC) features with all-analog circuits, providing a better spotting performance than the present analog short-time amplitude or energy features under the same condition. At the circuit level, the analog-MFCC extraction includes the low-noise amplifier, BPF, squarer, integrator, and discrete cosine transformer. And thanks to the effective analog-MFCC features, the size of the fully-connected neural network (FCNN) classifier in our KWS system is enormously reduced. A high-order and fully-differential BPF is also proposed, achieving ultra-low power and high dynamic range by combining zero and pole generation stages rather than building stages separately in traditional ways. Fabricated in 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  CMOS, our filterbank of eight BPFs is measured with a power consumption of 83.2 nW, with a 69.7 dB dynamic range at 5% THD, having advantages over other SC BPFs with similar functions. The total power consumption of our feature extractor is 661.7 nW, achieving an accuracy of 96.6% in two-keyword spotting by an FPGA-based, 15k bit parameter FCNN with a 9.6  $\mu \text{s}$  latency.</description></item><item><title>An 8-T Processing-in-Memory SRAM Cell-Based Pixel-Parallel Array Processor for Vision Chips</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10252054</link><description>Vision chip is a high-speed image processing device, featuring a massively-parallel pixel-level processing element (PE) array to boost pixel processing speed. However, the collocated processing unit and fine-grained data memory unit inside each PE impose a huge requirement on memory access bandwidth as well as big area and energy consumption. To overcome this bottleneck, this paper proposes a full custom 8T SRAM-based Processing-in-Memory (PIM) architecture together with a multiplexer-based arithmetic-logic unit (mux-based ALU) to realize pixel-parallel array processor for energy-efficient vision chips. The proposed PIM architecture is constructed by embroidering each dual-port 8T SRAM cell with mux-based ALU, so as to form a PIM PE array. Each PIM PE holds a 130-bit 8T SRAM cell block embedding in-memory logic functions, of which 128-bit 8T SRAM cells serve as the PE memory, and 2-bit 8T SRAM cells act as a buffer register in the PE. A full custom physical layout of a  $128\times128$  prototyping PIM PE array is designed and evaluated using a 65 nm CMOS technology. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed PIM PE architecture could operate under a 200 MHz clock frequency with a 1.0 V power supply, and reach a high energy efficiency of 512 GOPS/W and a high area efficiency of 29 GOPS/mm2.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Design of Precision-Scalable Computation Array for Efficient Neural Radiance Field Rendering</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10189081</link><description>Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), a disruptive method for 3D representation and rendering, is extremely popular in the field of computer graphics and computer vision in the past three years. The most distinctive feature of NeRF models is their scene representation property, making it possible to quantize the models according to the complexity of the representing scenes. This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the efficiency of NeRF rendering by adopting precision-scalable computation. We first analyze and validate the idea of scene-dependent quantization for NeRF models. Based on that, we further propose look-up table (LUT) processing element (PE)-based precision-scalable computation unit designs. To evaluate the performance of different precision-scalable computing units, we implement these designs and compare the corresponding area, power, speed and energy efficiency. We also compare the proposed designs with existing approaches as well as the fixed precision approach for NeRF rendering tasks. The comparison results show that energy efficiency can be significantly improved by using precision-scalable computation for NeRF.</description></item><item><title>A 50Gb/s CMOS Optical Receiver With Si-Photonics PD for High-Speed Low-Latency Chiplet I/O</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10256215</link><description>This paper presents a 50-Gb/s optical receiver (ORX) chipset, consisting of a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) and a clock and data recovery (CDR) circuit in a 45-nm silicon-on-insulator CMOS. The proposed inverter-based TIA employs hybrid shunt-series peaking inductors to extend the bandwidth (BW). A baud-rate CDR is proposed to reduce the sampling phases and clocking power by half. To optimise the ORX for in- package integration, a compact-size digital loop is adopted in each channel, and the clock is recovered by phase interpolation from a shared reference. A complete optical-to-electrical (OE) link is built by integrating the proposed ORX with a high-speed Silicon Photonics (SiP) photodetector (PD). Measurements show that the proposed TIA has a transimpedance gain of 53 dB $\Omega $  and a BW of 27 GHz. By integrating it with the SiP PD, the OE front-end (PD+TIA) achieves an input sensitivity of &#8722;7.7 dBm at 50 Gb/s and BER $ &lt; 10^{-12}$ . It features a power efficiency of 1.61 pJ/bit at a data rate of 64 Gb/s. The complete 50 Gb/s ORX achieves data recovery at a quarter rate of 12.5 Gb/s with an output jitter of 1.6 psrms, and has a 3.125 GHz clock with phase noise of &#8722;115.22 dBc/Hz at an offset frequency of 1 MHz.</description></item><item><title>Design of High Hardware Efficiency Approximate Floating-Point FFT Processor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10203014</link><description>The Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT), as a high-efficiency algorithm of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), is widely used in Digital Signal Processing (DSP), wireless communication systems, spectrum analysis, and image processing. Approximate computing has shown effectiveness and feasibility to enhance the hardware efficiency of these applications. However, most approximate units in previous works are designed case by case, which has low efficiency and is difficult to find the optimal design. In this paper, a top-down design strategy for approximate floating-point (FP) FFT is proposed, which includes a mantissa bit-width adjustment algorithm and a step-by-step multiplier approximation algorithm. With the mantissa bit-width adjustment algorithm, the approximate 64 FP FFT achieved 50% area reduction and 70% power-delay product (PDP) reduction compared to the exact design with a 60dB Signal Noise Ratio (SNR) requirement, which is also at least 52% and 33% better than the previous approximate FP FFT. After using the step-by-step multiplier approximation algorithm, the approximate mantissa multiplier with an 8-bit fractional part reduced the area and PDP by 81.15% and 93.70%, respectively. The feasibility of the proposed approximate FFT design is verified in the channel estimation module of a wireless communication system, spectrum analysis, and image processing system.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Cancellation of Inter-Symbol Interference in High-Speed Continuous-Time DACs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10225436</link><description>Inter-symbol interference (ISI) often limits the performance of high-speed continuous-time digital-to-analog converters (DACs) such as Nyquist-rate current-steering DACs. The most effective previously-published means of mitigating ISI is return-to-zero (RZ) pulse shaping. Unfortunately, such RZ DACs are significantly more sensitive to clock jitter than their non-return-to-zero (NRZ) counterparts, particularly at high clock rates, and they typically consume more than twice the power of comparable NRZ DACs. This paper proposes, demonstrates via simulation, and rigorously analyzes a calibration technique which circumvents the need for RZ pulse shaping by adaptively measuring and cancelling ISI over the DAC&#8217;s first Nyquist band. It can be operated in both foreground and background calibration modes, and is compatible and can share circuitry with a recently-published calibration technique that similarly cancels error from component mismatches and clock skew.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Design of Cold-Start Charge Pumps for Photovoltaic Energy Harvesters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10230908</link><description>This article presents modeling and design optimization of switched-capacitor charge pumps for use as cold-start circuits in photovoltaic energy harvesters. For a successful cold-start from photovoltaic energy, a certain output voltage and current must be generated by the charge pump while jointly minimizing the required input voltage and current from the energy harvesting source. We model the operation of the cold-start charge pump including its oscillator, derive expressions for required input voltage and current based on output requirements, and demonstrate a Pareto-optimal design space that defines the tradeoff between the required input voltage and current to achieve cold-start. We then assess the impacts of process and temperature variation, and suggest a general design methodology for cold-start charge pump circuits. Finally, we validate models with measurements from a design fabricated in 55nm CMOS.</description></item><item><title>SSM-CIM: An Efficient CIM Macro Featuring Single-Step Multi-bit MAC Computation for CNN Edge Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10214415</link><description>Compute-in-memory (CIM) is a promising approach to solving the memory-wall problem existing in traditional computing architectures. In this paper, we introduce SSM-CIM, a charge-domain, static random-access memory (SRAM)-based CIM macro designed for area-energy-efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) inference. SSM-CIM utilizes an original sign-magnitude data encoding method for both inputs and weights. By codesigning four adjacent SRAM computing cells and employing a 3-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC), SSM-CIM performs accurate 4-bit multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) computation in a single step, eliminating the peripheral digital shift-and-add circuits. To digitize the MAC computing results, a dedicated multi-reference assisted SAR ADC is designed by reusing the reference voltages from the DAC, which offers significant power and area savings. In addition, analog computing errors and quantization errors are analyzed to ensure the multi-bit computing accuracy of SSM-CIM. SSM-CIM is implemented and evaluated using 28-nm global foundry process. The post-layout simulation results validate the excellent computing linearity and accuracy of SSM-CIM. Benefitting from the compact layout design and fully parallel computing flow, the  $144\times 256$  macro achieves a peak throughput of 2.3 TOPS, an area efficiency of 10.2 TOPS/mm2, and an energy efficiency of 205.4 TOPS/W with 4-bit weights and 4-bit inputs.</description></item><item><title>A 0.0325-mm&#178; 114-to-147-GHz 6-Bit Passive Vector-Modulated Phase Shifter With MN-Embedded Isolated Power Combiner Achieving &lt;3.7&#176; RMS Phase Error in 65-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10213358</link><description>This paper presents an ultra-compact 114-to-147-GHz 6-bit passive vector-modulated phase shifter (P-VMPS) with a compact matching network (MN) embedded isolated power combiner. The proposed power combiner consists of two coupled-line-based distributed-baluns connected in parallel to achieve impedance matching, power combining and balanced-to-unbalanced transformation. Extra coupled-lines and RC networks are added between the two differential ports for impedance matching and isolation performance enhancement. By absorbing the impedance matching and balanced-to-unbalanced transformation functions into the power combiner itself, the area of the entire phase shifter is significantly reduced. Folded quadrature hybrid coupler (QHC) and analog-controlled X-type attenuator (X-ATT) are utilized for I/Q signal generation and phase-invertible gain tuning. A proof-of-concept P-VMPS is implemented in 65-nm CMOS technology with a core area of only 0.0325 mm2. Measurement results show that the proposed VMPS can provide full 360&#176; phase-shifting range with 5.625&#176; phase step. The measured RMS phase/gain error is from 1.1 to 3.7&#176;/0.6 to 1.5 dB within 114-to-147 GHz. This P-VMPS achieves superior performance in terms of phase resolution, RMS phase error and area compared with the state-of-the-art D-band phase shifters.</description></item><item><title>Orthogonal Filter Frequency Followed by LNA Linearity Tuning for Efficient Instinctual GaN Receiver Front-End</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10230912</link><description>This work presents an interference-adaptive Gallium Nitride (GaN) low-noise amplifier (LNA) front-end with orthogonal frequency and linearity tuning for applications in communication base stations, radar and electronic warfare (EW). The system operates between 2&#8211;6 GHz and provides a sub 5 ms tuning time for an input power tuning range of 40 dB. The orthogonal tuning consists of two phases: 1. frequency tuning with four tunable bandpass and bandstop filters for interference rejection, 2. linearity tuning with a combination of coarse tuning through look-up table (LUT) and fine-tuning through incremental adaptation to trade off power with linearity. GaN LNA&#8217;s linearity can be adjusted between P textsubscript 1dB,IN = -10 and 1.5 dBm with output P textsubscript 1dB up to 25 dBm (11.5 dB range) with the LNA power changing from 500 mW to 2 W (x4 increase). The average LNA power with orthogonal frequency and linearity tuning decreases by 56% as compared with the system operating at the worst-case no tuning condition. Two systems involving commercial filters and custom cavity resonator-based filters were constructed. The filters further increase the system P textsubscript 1dB,IN by the filter rejection of the interference signal. The rest of the controls consume about 10% of the worst-case condition LNA power.</description></item><item><title>An Active Resistor for Ultra Low Power Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10288190</link><description>The paper regards a new active resistor for ultra-low power applications.

To attain the M-type vibration trajectory of the drilling tool, the dual frequency, which the first and the third order frequency of the transducer, is excited at the same time, and the vibration amplitude of the transducer is controlled in independent or coupling mode. Due to the resonant frequency of the transducer is shifted during the drilling process, the resonant frequency tracking (RFT) of the first-order frequency is developed. In order to accurately achieve the phase between the voltage and current, we propose a fourth order Butter-worth low pass filter to the zero-crossing circuits to realize RFT of the first-order frequency of the transducer. Moreover, a dual-frequency direct digital synthesis (DDS) which can generate a mixed signal output with independent frequency and vibration amplitude control is proposed. Finally, a 100 Watt prototype of dual-frequency ultrasonic generator is established to verify the proposed dual-frequency DDS and RFT.</description></item><item><title>Digital Hardware Implementation of Morris-Lecar, Izhikevich, and Hodgkin-Huxley Neuron Models With High Accuracy and Low Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10226463</link><description>The neuron can be called the main cell of a nervous system that can transmit messages from one neuron to another neuron or another cell through electrical signals. In neuromorphic engineering, the hardware realization and simulation of these neurons are crucial. To accomplish a proper digital implementation (i.e. reducing hardware resources and increasing speed and accuracy) of three important neuron models including Hodgkin-Huxley, Morris-Lecar, and Izhikevich, this study proposes a set of multiplier-less mathematical equations based on converting nonlinear functions to  $2^{x}$  functions. Then optimizes the proposed equations based on reducing the number of different  $2^{x}$  terms. The suggested model can accurately recreate the behavioral characteristics of the original neuron models. The suggested model was synthesized and implemented on the Zynq XC7Z010 (3CLG400) reconfigurable board (FPGA) to validate the mathematical simulation findings. The results of hardware synthesizing and implementations of the proposed model show that different biological behavior can be replicated with greater efficiency and at substantially reduced implementation costs. This method (implemented on the zynq board) can raise the frequency of the proposed models at least by up to 3.5 times that of the original model and reduce power consumption between 20% and 60% for different proposed models. Also, due to the reduction of hardware resources in the proposed model, it is possible to implement a much larger number of neurons (between 4 and 12 times) relative to the original model on a single zynq board.</description></item><item><title>Design of a Compact Superconducting RSFQ Register File</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10254238</link><description>In comparison to the widely-used CMOS circuits, superconducting Rapid Single Flux Quantum (RSFQ) circuits offer advantages such as fast operating frequency and low power consumption, making them a potential direction for development in the post-Moore era of digital circuits. However, designing RSFQ CPUs faces challenges, one of which is the need for a compact register file. This is because, under current RSFQ circuit process conditions, the memory module typically occupies a large chip area. This paper proposes a newly-designed Write-controllable Non-Destructive Read Out cell (WNDRO) that can limit the data writing pulse input to change the internal state of the cell. Based on the WNDRO, a compact RSFQ register file is designed that can realize random, non-destructive data reading. Additionally, a global write strategy is applied to omit the data write routing circuit and the reset control module, and the circuit design of the read and write control module is optimized. In comparison to general designs, the proposed compact register file design will save a large number of Josephson Junctions and effectively reduce the chip area. Additionally, this paper proposes several optimization logic designs for RSFQ CPU designers as a reference.</description></item><item><title>High-Throughput Rate-Flexible Combinational Decoders for Multi-Kernel Polar Codes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10252139</link><description>Polar codes have received growing attention in the past decade and have been selected as the coding scheme for the control channel in the fifth generation (5G) wireless communication systems. However, the conventional polar codes have only been constructed by binary ( $2\times 2$ ) kernel, which poses block length limitation to powers of 2. To attain more flexible block lengths, multi-kernel polar codes are proposed. In this paper, a combinational architecture for multi-kernel polar codes with high throughput is proposed based on successive cancellation decoding algorithm. The proposed scheme can decode pure-binary, pure-ternary ( $3\times 3$ ), and binary-ternary mixed polar codes. The decoder&#8217;s architecture is rate-flexible, meaning that a new code rate can be assigned to the decoder at every clock cycle. The proposed architecture is validated by FPGA implementation, and the results reveal that a code of size  $N=81$  achieves the coded throughput of 1664.5 Mbps. A Python-based polar compiler is also proposed to automatically generate the HDL modules for target decoders. A designer can input the target block length and kernel ordering of a polar code and get the required VHDL files automatically.</description></item><item><title>Semi-Global Bounded Output Regulation of Linear Two-Time-Scale Systems With Input Saturation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10213278</link><description>Standard output regulation design techniques cannot be applied for linear two-time-scale systems subject to saturated inputs. In this work, a state feedback output regulation is first proposed based on a classical stabilizing composite state feedback controller. Nevertheless, the corresponding design is difficult to implement due to numerical issues. Thus, the method of asymptotic power series expansion is applied to provide an approximate solution to the regulator equation. Then, a time-continuous state feedback controller is designed by combining the Chang transformation approach and the low-gain feedback technique, which results in a semi-global bounded output regulation of the closed-loop system. Furthermore, to reduce control updates, a dynamic event-triggered control scheme is proposed which ensures the exclusion of Zeno behavior by maintaining a strictly positive time between any two triggering moments, regardless of the initial state of the system. Additionally, an observer-based event-triggered control scheme is proposed to cater to the practical scenario in which system state information is unavailable. Finally, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed technique, two examples are presented.</description></item><item><title>Controller Synthesis of Aperiodic Sampled-Data Networked Control System With Application to Interleaved Flyback Module Integrated Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10192566</link><description>This paper investigates the stability analysis and controller design issues for aperiodic sampled-data networked control systems with time-varying delays. Three main results are obtained. Firstly, the discretized model with delay is constructed as an feedback interconnected system formed by a structural uncertainty operator and a linear time-invariant system. Secondly, an exponential decay rate is introduced as a performance index of the system through model transformation, an equivalent stability condition for the system is also obtained, further, the conclusion is extended to systems with arbitrary initial states. On this basis, the exponential stability conditions with minimal computational complexity are given under an integral quadratic constraint. Thirdly, an iterative algorithm for the solution of the controller is given to deal with the effects of non-linear coupling terms. Finally, two numerical examples and an application example of an interleaved flyback modular integrated converter are used to illustrate the effectiveness and computational simplicity of the stability criterion and the controller design algorithm of this paper.</description></item><item><title>A Level Shifter With Almost Full Immunity to Positive dv/dt for Buck Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10236598</link><description>High-frequency buck converters need a fast transition of switching nodes (high dv/dt). Such high dv/dt, especially the positive one, can cause malfunction of a conventional pulse-triggered active-coupled (PTAC) level shifter that is used to control the high-side NMOS switch. In this work, we first discuss the dv/dt immunity of conventional PTAC level shifters. Subsequently, we propose a new scheme to block the noise current during the dv/dt sequence, allowing an almost full immunity to the positive dv/dt. With this scheme, the maximum dv/dt is determined by how well the circuitry is protected from the overvoltage during the dv/dt sequence. We design a 20-V buck converter with this level shifter, fabricated in 180-nm BCD process. Experimental results show it works correctly under a 67-V/ns dv/dt.</description></item><item><title>Fully Integrated Galvanic Isolation Interface in GaN Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10195836</link><description>This paper presents for the first time a fully integrated galvanic isolation interface in a GaN technology. It is based on planar micro-antennas and chip-to-chip communication with an on-off keying-modulated RF carrier. This approach can achieve high isolation rating and high common-mode transient immunity by properly setting the distance between chips. The interface provides the isolation channel for a main driver/power switch and the one for the control feedback of the dc-dc converter providing the isolated power supply. Driver and power control channels adopt an RF carrier of 2 GHz and 1.2 GHz, which are modulated by a pulse width modulated signal of 2 MHz and 0.5 MHz, respectively. The interface includes a continuously operating offset compensation approach, which overcomes not only the strong variations due to the large process tolerances of the GaN technology, but also offset drifts due to temperature variations. An accurate pulse width modulated signal with a large duty cycle variation in both channels was achieved. The isolation interface adopts a 6-V power supply, which delivers a quiescent current of 6.3 mA and 7.5 mA to the driver and power control channels, respectively, assuming a signal with a duty cycle of 50%.</description></item><item><title>The Intrinsic Communication in Power Systems: A New Perspective to Understand Synchronization Stability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10224064</link><description>The large-scale integration of converter-interfaced resources in electrical power systems raises new threats to stability which call for a new theoretical framework for modelling and analysis. In this paper, we present the intrinsic analogy of a power system to a communication system, which is here called power-communication isomorphism. Based on this isomorphism, we revisit power system stability from a communication perspective and thereby establish a theory that unifies the heterogeneous power apparatuses of power systems and provides a bridge between electromagnetic transient (EMT) and phasor dynamics. This theory yields several new insights into power system stability and new possibilities for stabilization. In particular, we demonstrate that a system of 100% converter-interfaced resources can achieve stable synchronization in small- and large-signal sense under grid-following control which was commonly considered impossible.</description></item><item><title>Unknown System Dynamic Estimator-Based Two-Phase Power Reaching Law Control for DC&#8211;DC Buck Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10255240</link><description>In this paper, an unknown system dynamic estimator-based reaching law control scheme is proposed for buck converters with parameter uncertainties, input voltage fluctuations and load variations. By utilizing a first-order low-pass filter, a simple unknown system dynamic estimator (USDE) with only one design parameter is constructed to efficiently compensate for the lumped disturbance. Then, a two-phase power reaching law is presented for the sliding mode controller design, and a relatively fast convergence of the sliding variable is guaranteed in the whole reaching process by adjusting the power value according to the variation range of the sliding variable. With the proposed scheme, both the transient and steady-state voltage tracking performance are achieved with a relatively accurate convergence time expression of the sliding variable. Theoretical analysis and experimental validation are provided to show the feasibility of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Sensitivity Analysis of Free-Standing Columnar Magnetic Field Energy Harvester for Powering Wireless Monitoring Sensors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10236512</link><description>Magnetic field energy harvesting is the effective method to power the monitoring sensors by capturing the magnetic field around the current-carrying structures. However, conventional toroidal magnetic field energy harvester (MFEH) face challenges in meeting the requirements of high anti-saturation characteristics and convenient installation. These limitations hinder the advancement of magnetic field energy scavenging. This paper introduces the integration of the columnar MFEH and the low-power current sensor to enable current status monitoring of the power equipment. The sensitivity of free-standing columnar magnetic field energy harvester is analyzed using the method of magnetic flux block superposition at first. Accordingly, comprehensive studies are conducted on various parameters such as the number of turns, the winding configurations, magnetic core dimension and the through-hole radius of the magnetic core. Further, the operational performance of the energy harvester is investigated in scenarios involving offset and rotation. The experiment evaluations of the proposed design are presented by powering the wireless current sensor periodically. The experimental results demonstrate that the periodic wireless chip current sensor can be driven under a 300 A power line current with intervals of 29 seconds. As a result, the proposed solution proves to be highly effective in scavenging magnetic field energy around power lines and can be employed to power wireless monitoring sensors.</description></item><item><title>A 0.15-&#956;s/V Buck-Boost Symbol-Power-Tracking Supply Modulator With Dual Auxiliary Current Paths and EPP Scheme for 5G NR Power Amplifiers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10284983</link><description>Envelope tracking (ET) and average power tracking (APT) have been widely used as supply modulators of power amplifiers (PAs). To meet the new challenges brought by the 5G NR standard, the symbol power tracking (SPT) technique is proposed, which is more efficient than ET and more flexible than APT. For the application of subcarrier spacing (SCS) of 15-~60kHz in the frequency range 1 (FR1), this paper proposed a buck-boost SPT supply modulator with a transition time below 1.17- $\mu \text{s}$  for 5G NR PA in the smartphone. The combination of three techniques improves the voltage transition speed. The charge-pump-based switching power modulator increases the output voltage higher than the battery voltage and offers a high voltage source for the auxiliary current paths (ACP). The ACP introduces additional currents to charge/discharge the 1- $\mu \text{F}$  output capacitor. The end-point-prediction (EPP) scheme lets the compensator convert directly from one steady state to the next. This supply modulator circuit is designed and fabricated using 0.18- $\mu \text{m}$  BCD technology. The output voltage range is 1&#8211;5-V. The maximum transition speed can be up to 0.37- $\mu \text{s}$ /V and 0.15- $\mu \text{s}$ /V for up-tracking and down-tracking, respectively.</description></item><item><title>TREAD-M3D: Temperature-Aware DNN Accelerators for Monolithic 3-D Mobile Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10148068</link><description>Monolithic 3-D (MONO3 D) integration provides performance and power efficiency benefits over 2-D circuits and, thus, is a potent technology for the design of deep neural network (DNN) accelerators with enhanced energy efficiency. However, high IC temperatures are major challenges for the design of MONO3 D systems. To this end, this article focuses on designing temperature-aware MONO3 D DNN accelerators. We propose a new automated method, called TREAD- M3 D, that provides a near-optimal MONO3 D DNN accelerator architecture in terms of systolic array size, SRAM organization, partition across 3-D layers, and operating frequency, for a given DNN, optimization goal, and temperature constraint. TREAD- M3 D incorporates circuit- and architecture-level models to evaluate the power and performance characteristics of different partitions. Our method reveals valuable insights and enables tradeoff analysis for achieving high energy efficiency in MONO3 D systolic arrays. In comparison to recent works that adopt a fixed partition choice to design MONO3 D DNN systems, TREAD- M3 D yields up to 22% higher energy efficiency. Using TREAD- M3 D, we further demonstrate that temperature unawareness not only leads to infeasible configurations due to temperature violations but also over-estimates energy-delay-product benefits by up to 24%.</description></item><item><title>REX-SC: Range-Extended Stochastic Computing Accumulation for Neural Network Acceleration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10146489</link><description>Deep learning has grown in capability and size in recent years, prompting research on alternative computing methods to cope with the increased compute cost. Stochastic computing (SC) promises higher compute efficiency with its compact compute units, but accuracy issues have prevented wide adoption, and accuracy-improving techniques have sacrificed runtime or training performance. In this work, we propose extended range SC&#8212;Range-Extended SC Accumulation to deal with the accuracy issues of SC. By modifying the functionality of OR-based SC accumulation, we increase SC computation accuracy without sacrificing the performance benefits. Our approach achieves a  $2\times $  reduction in stream length for the same accuracy compared to SC with OR-based accumulation and an up to  $3.6\times $  improvement in energy compared to SC with binary addition. With proper modeling, our approach improves training performance for SC-based neural networks and makes training SC models practical for large datasets like ImageNet.</description></item><item><title>Scalable Detection of Hardware Trojans Using ATPG-Based Activation of Rare Events</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10167853</link><description>Semiconductor supply chain vulnerability is a major concern in designing trustworthy systems. Malicious implants, popularly known as hardware Trojans (HTs), can get introduced at different stages in the system-on-chip (SoC) design cycle. While there are promising test generation techniques for HT detection, they have two practical limitations: 1) these approaches are designed to activate rare states while ignoring rare transitions and 2) these approaches are not scalable for large designs. In this article, we propose a scalable test generation framework to address the above challenges. Our threat model assumes that an adversary may exploit rare events consisting of rare signals (states) as well as rare branches (transitions). We show that the rare branch coverage problem can be mapped to the rare signal coverage problem. We propose a scalable framework for detecting HTs using automated test pattern generation (ATPG)-based activation of rare events. Specifically, we utilize the complementary abilities of N-detection and maximal clique activation of rare events to generate efficient test patterns. Experimental evaluation shows that our ATPG-based framework is scalable and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art test generation-based Trojan detection techniques.</description></item><item><title>Joint Protection Scheme for Deep Neural Network Hardware Accelerators and Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10143985</link><description>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are utilized in numerous image processing, object detection, and video analysis tasks and need to be implemented using hardware accelerators to achieve practical speed. Logic locking is one of the most popular methods for preventing chip counterfeiting. Nevertheless, existing logic-locking schemes need to sacrifice the number of input patterns leading to wrong output under incorrect keys to resist the powerful satisfiability (SAT)-attack. Furthermore, the DNN model inference is fault tolerant. Hence, using a wrong key for those SAT-resistant logic-locking schemes may not affect the accuracy of DNNs. This makes the previous SAT-resistant logic-locking scheme ineffective on protecting DNN accelerators. Besides, to prevent DNN models from being illegally used, the models need to be obfuscated by the designers before they are provided to end-users. Previous obfuscation methods either require a long time to retrain the model or leak information about the model. This article proposes a joint protection scheme for DNN hardware accelerators and models. The DNN accelerator is modified using a hardware key (Hkey) and a model key (Mkey). Different from previous logic locking, the Hkey, which is used to protect the accelerator, does not affect the output when it is wrong. As a result, the SAT attack can be effectively resisted. On the other hand, a wrong Hkey leads to substantial increase in memory accesses, inference time, and energy consumption and makes the accelerator unusable. A correct Mkey can recover the DNN model that is obfuscated by the proposed method. Compared to previous model obfuscation schemes, our proposed method avoids model retraining and does not leak model information.</description></item><item><title>Improved EM Side-Channel Analysis Attack Probe Detection Range Utilizing Coplanar Capacitive Asymmetry Sensing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10011212</link><description>While cryptographic implementations provide computational security in circuits and systems, hardware attack techniques, e.g., electromagnetic (EM) side-channel analysis (SCA) attack can still break through. The commonplace countermeasures for EM SCA attack require significant overheads in terms of power consumption. This article explores an on-chip capacitive sensing technique for the purpose of detection of an approaching EM probe even before an attack is performed, thereby alleviating the overheads incurred by any countermeasure against such attacks. Different type of capacitive structures are considered in regards to sensitivity and area. The proposed method of coplanar capacitive asymmetry sensing (CEASE) consists of a grid of four metal plates of the same size and dimensions determined through design space exploration. A comparison between the capacitive and inductive sensing technique is also performed in terms of detection range through theoretical arguments and EM simulation. A  $&gt;$ 17% change in capacitance is shown at a distance of 1 mm, implying a  $&gt;10\times $  improvement in the detection range over inductive sensing methods. Furthermore, at 0.1-mm distance, a  $&gt;$  45% change in capacitance is observed, leading to a  $&gt;3\times $  and  $&gt;11\times $  sensitivity improvement over capacitive parallel plate sensing and inductive sensing, respectively.</description></item><item><title>IMGA: Efficient In-Memory Graph Convolution Network Aggregation With Data Flow Optimizations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10159135</link><description>Aggregating features from neighbor vertices is a fundamental operation in graph convolution network (GCN). However, the sparsity in graph data creates poor spatial and temporal locality, causing dynamic and irregular memory access patterns and limiting the performance of aggregation on the Von Neumann architecture. The emerging processing-in-memory (PIM) architecture is based on emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM), like spin-orbit torque magnetic RAM (SOT-MRAM), and demonstrates promising prospects in alleviating the Von Neumann bottleneck. However, the limited memory capacity of PIM medium still incurs non-negligible data movements between PIM architecture and external memory. To solve this challenge, we propose an SOT-MRAM-based in-memory computing architecture, called IMGA, for efficient in-situ graph aggregation. Specifically, we design adaptive data flow management strategies that reuse vertex data in MRAM when processing graphs of different scales and adopt edge data as the control signal source to utilize the graph&#8217;s structural information. A reordering optimization strategy leveraging hardware&#8211;software co-design principle is proposed to further reduce the costly data movement. Experimental results demonstrate that IMGA achieves an average  $2523\times $  and  $21\times $  speedup, and 1.03E+6 and 1.04E+3 energy efficiency compared with CPU and GPU, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Implementation Methodology for Error Correction Codes on a Neuromorphic Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10149083</link><description>The Internet of Things infrastructure connects a massive number of edge devices with an increasing demand for intelligent sensing and inferencing capability. Such data-sensitive functions necessitate energy-efficient and programmable implementations of error correction codes (ECCs) and decoders. The algorithmic flow of ECCs with concurrent accumulation and comparison types of operations are innately exploitable by neuromorphic architectures for energy-efficient execution&#8212;an area that is relatively unexplored outside of machine learning applications. For the first time, we propose a methodology to map the hard-decision class of decoder algorithms on a neuromorphic architecture. We present the implementation of the Gallager B (GaB) decoding algorithm on a TrueNorth-inspired architecture that is emulated on the Xilinx Zynq ZCU102 MPSoC. Over this reference implementation, we propose architectural modifications at the neuron block level that result in a reduction of energy consumption by 31% with a negligible increase in resource usage while achieving the same error correction performance.</description></item><item><title>Cryptensor: A Resource-Shared Co-Processor to Accelerate Convolutional Neural Network and Polynomial Convolution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10185590</link><description>Practical deployment of convolutional neural network (CNN) and cryptography algorithm on constrained devices are challenging due to the huge computation and memory requirement. Developing separate hardware accelerator for AI and cryptography incur large area consumption, which is not desirable in many applications. This article proposes a viable solution to this issue by expressing the CNN and cryptography as generic-matrix-multiplication (GEMM) operations and map them to the same accelerator for reduced hardware consumption. A novel systolic tensor array (STA) design was proposed to reduce the data movement, effectively reducing the operand registers by  $2\times $ . Two novel techniques, input layer extension and polynomial factorization, are proposed to mitigate the under-utilization issue found in existing STA architecture. Additionally, the tensor processing element (TPE) is fused using DSP unit to reduce the look-up table (LUT) and flip-flops (FFs) consumption for implementing multipliers. On top of that, a novel memory efficient factorization technique is proposed to allow computation of polynomial convolution on the same STA. Experimental results show that Cryptensor achieved 21.6% better throughput for VGG-16 implementation on XC7Z020 FPGA; up to  $8.40\times $  better-energy efficiency compared to existing ResNet-18 implementation on XC7Z045 FPGA. Cryptensor can also flexibly support multiple security levels in NTRU scheme, with no additional hardware. The proposed hardware unifies the computation of two different domains that are critical for IoT applications, which greatly reduces the hardware consumption on edge nodes.</description></item><item><title>Poseidon-NDP: Practical Fully Homomorphic Encryption Accelerator Based on Near Data Processing Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10172329</link><description>With the development of the important solution for privacy computing&#8212;fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), the explosion of data size, and computing intensity in FHE applications brings enormous challenges to the hardware design. In this article, we propose a novel co-design scheme for FHE acceleration named &#8220;Poseidon-NDP,&#8221; which focuses on improving the efficiency of the hardware resource and the bandwidth. Specifically, we investigate the special implications of the hardware imposed by the FHE applications. It empirically shows that the FHE performance is suffered from both the intractable data movement and the computation bottleneck. Besides, we also introduce the opportunity and the challenges of accelerating FHE on near data processing (NDP) architecture. Based on such analysis, we propose an optimized technique called &#8220;NTT-fusion&#8221; to simplify the FHE operator and reduce its hardware overhead. Then, we design the accelerator based on the simplified operator to achieve maximized data and computation parallelism with limited hardware resources. Additionally, we evaluate Poseidon-NDP with 4 domain-specific FHE applications on the SmartSSD, which is a practical NDP device. The empirical studies show that the efficient co-design enables Poseidon-NDP vastly superior to the state-of-the-art FHE acceleration techniques: 1) up to  $217\times /84\times $  speedup over CPU and high-performance GPUs for the number theoretic transform; 2) up to  $3.7\times /29\times $  higher-speedup/energy delay product (EDP) over the SOTA FPGA accelerator for the FHE applications; and 3) up to  $4.9\times $  higher-bandwidth utilization over CPU due to the NDP-based architecture.</description></item><item><title>Algorithm/Hardware Co-Optimization for Sparsity-Aware SpMM Acceleration of GNNs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10139803</link><description>In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive performance in various application fields by extracting information from graph-structured data. It contains extensive feature aggregation operations and has become a performance bottleneck, which can be abstracted as a specialized sparse-dense matrix multiplication (SpMM) operation. Previous works have leveraged the inner product or outer product to accelerate the feature aggregation process. However, inefficient execution leads to extremely unbalanced workloads and extensive intermediate data, hampering the performance of previous processors. So in this article, we demonstrate an algorithm/hardware co-optimization chance to enhance SpMM acceleration for GNNs. First, the algorithm part develops a dataflow-efficient SpMM algorithm that integrates three optimization methods to mitigate computation and memory access inefficiencies. Specifically, 1) the proposed equal-value partition method achieves fine-grained data partition and enables load balancing during data movement; 2) after observing the vertex aggregation phenomenon, a vertex-clustering optimization method is presented to enable significant data locality; and 3) the adaptive dataflow based on Gustavson&#8217;s algorithm is further implemented to enable the efficient distribution of sparse elements and improves computing resource utilization. Then, the hardware part features the proposed SpMM algorithm and customizes SDMA, a flexible and efficient accelerator to boost SpMM acceleration, which follows the adaptive dataflow to eliminate sparsity and explore the regular parallelism dimension. Finally, we prototype SDMA on the Xilinx Alveo U280 FPGA accelerator card. The results demonstrate that SDMA achieves  $5.68\times $ &#8211; $14.68\times $  energy efficiency over the previous GPU implementations deployed on the Nvidia GTX 1080Ti and  $1.32\times $  higher throughput over the state-of-the-art FPGA prototype.</description></item><item><title>SCV-GNN: Sparse Compressed Vector-Based Graph Neural Network Aggregation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10171219</link><description>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool to process graph-based data in fields like communication networks, molecular interactions, chemistry, social networks, and neuroscience. GNNs are characterized by the ultrasparse nature of their adjacency matrix that necessitates the development of dedicated hardware beyond general-purpose sparse matrix multipliers. While there has been extensive research on designing dedicated hardware accelerators for GNNs, few have extensively explored the impact of the sparse storage format on the efficiency of the GNN accelerators. This article proposes SCV-GNN with the novel sparse compressed vectors (SCVs) format optimized for the aggregation operation. We use  $Z$ -Morton ordering to derive a data-locality-based computation ordering and partitioning scheme. This article also presents how the proposed SCV-GNN is scalable on a vector processing system. Experimental results over various datasets show that the proposed method achieves a geometric mean speedup of  $7.96\times $  and  $7.04\times $  over compressed sparse column (CSC) and compressed sparse row (CSR) aggregation operations, respectively. The proposed method also reduces the memory traffic by a factor of  $3.29\times $  and  $4.37\times $  over CSC and CSR, respectively. Thus, the proposed novel aggregation format reduces the latency and memory access for GNN inference.</description></item><item><title>TransCODE: Co-Design of Transformers and Accelerators for Efficient Training and Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10144614</link><description>Automated co-design of machine learning models and evaluation hardware is critical for efficiently deploying such models at scale. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of transformer models, they are not yet ready for execution on resource-constrained hardware platforms. High memory requirements and low parallelizability of the transformer architecture exacerbate this problem. Recently proposed accelerators attempt to optimize the throughput and energy consumption of transformer models. However, such works are either limited to a one-sided search of the model architecture or a restricted set of off-the-shelf devices. Furthermore, previous works only accelerate model inference and not training, which incurs substantially higher memory and compute resources, making the problem even more challenging. To address these limitations, this work proposes a dynamic training framework, called DynaProp, that speeds up the training process and reduces memory consumption. DynaProp is a low-overhead pruning method that prunes activations and gradients at runtime. To effectively execute this method on hardware for a diverse set of transformer architectures, we propose a flexible BERT accelerator, a framework that simulates transformer inference and training on a design space of accelerators. We use this simulator in conjunction with the proposed co-design technique, called TransCODE, to obtain the best-performing models with high accuracy on the given task and minimize latency, energy consumption, and chip area. The obtained transformer&#8211;accelerator pair achieves 0.3% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art pair while incurring  $5.2\times $  lower latency and  $3.0\times $  lower energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Engine for Accelerating GNN Weighting/Aggregation Operations, With Efficient Load Balancing and Graph-Specific Caching</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9999558</link><description>Graph neural networks (GNNs) analysis engines are vital for real-world problems that use large graph models. Challenges for a GNN hardware platform include the ability to 1) host a variety of GNNs; 2) handle high sparsity in input vertex feature vectors and the graph adjacency matrix and the accompanying random memory access patterns; and 3) maintain load-balanced computation in the face of uneven workloads, induced by high sparsity and power-law vertex degree distributions. This article proposes GNNIE, an accelerator designed to run a broad range of GNNs. It tackles workload imbalance by 1) splitting vertex feature operands into blocks; 2) reordering and redistributing computations; and 3) using a novel flexible MAC architecture. It adopts a graph-specific, degree-aware caching policy that is well suited to real-world graph characteristics. The policy enhances on-chip data reuse and avoids random memory access to DRAM. GNNIE achieves average speedups of  $7197\times $  over a CPU and  $17.81\times $  over a GPU over multiple datasets on graph attention networks (GATs), graph convolutional networks (GCNs), GraphSAGE, GINConv, and DiffPool. Compared to prior approaches, GNNIE achieves an average speedup of  $5\times $  over HyGCN (which cannot implement GATs) for GCN, GraphSAGE, and GINConv. GNNIE achieves an average speedup of  $1.3\times $  over AWB-GCN (which runs only GCNs), despite using  $3.4\times $  fewer processing units.</description></item><item><title>CoGNN: An Algorithm-Hardware Co-Design Approach to Accelerate GNN Inference With Minibatch Sampling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10131995</link><description>As a new algorithm of graph embedding, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used in many fields. However, GNN computing has the characteristics of both sparse graph processing and dense neural network, which make it difficult to be deployed efficiently on the existing graph processing accelerators or neural network accelerators. Recently, some GNN accelerators have been proposed, but the following challenges have not been fully solved: 1) the minibatch GNN inference scenario has the potential of software and hardware co-design, which can bring 30% computation amount reduction, and this is not well utilized. Besides, the cost of message flow graph construction is large and may account for more than 50% of the total delay; 2) the feature aggregation has a large amount of data access and relatively small amount of computation, which leads to low on-chip data reuse, only 10% of dense computing; and 3) without the optimization of sparse computing units, simple memory bank and cross bar architecture can easily lead to bank access conflict and load imbalance, reducing the utilization of computing units to less than 60%. In order to solve the above problems, we propose a algorithm-hardware co-design scheme to accelerate GNN inference, which includes three technologies: 1) a reuse-aware sampling method is proposed for minibatch inference scenarios, which reduces 30% of the calculation and improves the on-chip reusability of local data; 2) through the nodewise parallelism-aware quantization, the features and weights are quantized to integers with eight or four bits, which reduces the amount of memory access by at least four times; and 3) an accelerator supporting the above technologies is designed and evaluated, and different operations are supported by the sampling-inference integration architecture. The multibank on-chip memory pool is designed to support data reuse, and edge stream reordering is used to reduce data access conflicts, improving the utilization of computing units by  $1.5\times $ . Combined with the above technologies, the experiments show that our design achieves  $9.2\times $  speedup and  $29\times $  energy efficiency improvement compared with the Deep Graph Library framework running on servers equipped with CPU and GPU.</description></item><item><title>Partial Sum Quantization for Reducing ADC Size in ReRAM-Based Neural Network Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10179130</link><description>While resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) crossbar arrays have the potential to significantly accelerate deep neural network (DNN) training through fast and low-cost matrix&#8211;vector multiplication, peripheral circuits like analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) create a high overhead. These ADCs consume over half of the chip power and a considerable portion of the chip cost. To address this challenge, we propose advanced quantization techniques that can significantly reduce the ADC overhead of ReRAM crossbar arrays (RCAs). Our methodology interprets ADC as a quantization mechanism, allowing us to scale the range of ADC input optimally along with the weight parameters of a DNN, resulting in multiple-bit reduction in ADC precision. This approach reduces ADC size and power consumption by several times, and it is applicable to any DNN type (binarized or multibit) and any RCA size. Additionally, we propose ways to minimize the overhead of the digital scaler, which is an essential part of our scheme and sometimes required. Our experimental results using ResNet-18 on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our method can reduce the size of the ADC by 32 times compared to ISAAC with only a minimal accuracy loss degradation of 0.24%. We also present evaluation results in the presence of ReRAM nonideality (such as stuck-at fault).</description></item><item><title>LoCoExNet: Low-Cost Early Exit Network for Energy Efficient CNN Accelerator Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10143348</link><description>Early exit techniques, where the inference process of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is early terminated by using auxiliary classifiers (called branches) to reduce data processing energy for easy inputs, have been actively researched. However, the conventional early exit works have suffered from the large size of branches, whose memory access energy is significantly large compared to that of the main network. In this article, we propose a low-cost early exit network (LoCoExNet), which significantly improves energy efficiencies by reducing the parameters used in inference with efficient branch structures. To further reduce the energy consumption of branches, based on the observation that the classification difficulties of the images can be predicted using the magnitudes of input activations, we also propose hardware-friendly dynamic branch pruning (DBP). Given the network and target dataset, we can construct an energy-efficient early exit network through the branch structure determination algorithm and DBP algorithm. Finally, we develop several architectural supporting modules to improve the energy efficiency of the proposed LoCoExNet with DBP. The experimental results show that the LoCoExNet uses 28.7% of the total network parameters on average for Tiny-ImageNet dataset using VGG-16 without accuracy loss. The CNN accelerator that implements LoCoExNet with DBP has been implemented using the 65nm CMOS process. The implementation results show that the LoCoExNet accelerator achieves up to 91% of energy savings and up to  $4.46\mathbf {\times }$  of speedups without accuracy loss for CIFAR-10 dataset using VGG-16 compared to the state-of-the-art CNN accelerators.</description></item><item><title>SecureVolt: Enhancing Deep Neural Networks Security via Undervolting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10186350</link><description>Deep neural networks (DNNs) are shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks; carefully crafted additive noise that undermines DNNs integrity. Previously proposed defenses against these attacks require substantial overheads, making it challenging to deploy these solutions in power and computational resource-constrained devices, such as embedded systems and the Edge. In this article, we explore the use of voltage over-scaling (VOS) as a lightweight and efficient defense against adversarial attacks. Specifically, we exploit the stochastic timing violations of VOS within computing elements to implement a moving-target defense for DNNs. Our experimental results demonstrate that VOS guarantees effective defense against different attack methods, does not require any software/hardware modifications, and offers a by-product reduction in power consumption. We propose a space exploration to identify a possible tradeoff between robustness, accuracy, and power gains. Furthermore, we observe the behavior of models&#8217; epistemic uncertainty under variable undervolting aggressiveness. Our experiments show that model uncertainty analysis is coherent with the observation in our robustness/accuracy exploration.</description></item><item><title>Routing and Wavelength Assignment for Multiple Multicasts in Optical Network-on-Chip (ONoC)</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10124019</link><description>Optical network-on-chip (ONoC) is an emerging chip-scale optical interconnection technology to realize high-performance and power-efficient intercore communication for many-core processors. Multicast communication is popularly used in parallel applications on chip. However, existing researches for multicast in ONoC mainly focus on the optimization of one multicast. This limits the practical applications of the research outcomes because we often face the dynamic formation of multiple multicast groups in real network systems. In this article, we define the problem of routing and wavelength assignment for multiple multicasts in ONoC with the objective of minimizing the number of wavelengths required. To solve the problem, we first formulate it as an integer programming model for general topologies. Then we design routing policies for special instances that optimally use only one wavelength on mesh topology. For general instances, we design a group-partitioning routing algorithm for multiple multicasts (GPRMM). GPRMM decouples a group of multicasts into a number of subgroups, each of which matching one of the special instances. Theoretical results show that the number of wavelengths required by GPRMM is no more than the Destination Density  $\sigma _{d}$ , i.e., the maximum number of multicasts with destinations in the same row or column. Moreover, we find the upper bound and the lower bound on the number of wavelengths required for GPRMM. The wavelength requirement is also upper bounded by the network size  $n$  for an  $n\times n$  mesh network. Simulation results show that GPRMM can reduce the number of wavelengths by 26.7% compared with previous methods. GPRMM has the advantages of low routing complexity, low wavelength requirement, low power consumption, and good scalability.</description></item><item><title>In-Memory Set Operations on Memristor Crossbar</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10177962</link><description>Performance degradation and higher power dissipation for data-intensive applications are common in von Neumann computers. This is due to the data transfer between the memory and processor. Non-von Neumann architecture addresses this issue by performing computations within the memory, that is, in-memory computing. The nonvolatile memory can be built using an alternative building block called a memristor. Logical NOT and NOR gates can be realized on memristor crossbars. This allows to perform arithmetic and logic operations within the memory. An architectural support for a constant time in-memory comparison has been introduced. This adds FILL and MCMP instructions to the instruction set. Four basic set operations are implemented using the instruction set. In-memory union, cartesian product, transitive closure, and power set generation achieve an average energy reduction of  $168\times $ ,  $249\times $ ,  $134\times $ , and  $264\times $ , respectively. However, for higher input sizes, central processing unit-based union, cartesian product, and transitive closure perform better by an average of  $1.58\times $ ,  $1.23\times $ , and  $2.07\times $ , respectively. In-memory power set generation achieves an average speed-up of  $1.14\times $ .</description></item><item><title>MCM-GPU Voltage Noise Characterization and Architecture-Level Mitigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10131993</link><description>Due to manufacturing process and yield constraints, scaling GPU performance via increasing chip area becomes difficult. In the meanwhile, the demand for high computational throughput is increasing for high performance computing applications. As an alternative, multichip module GPU (MCM-GPU) achieves performance scalability via integrating multiple GPU chip modules (GPMs) on the same package. However, large MCM-GPU systems are susceptible to voltage noise effects, which cause voltage instability during program execution and result in energy inefficiency. In this work, we first model and analyze the voltage noise of MCM-GPUs at architecture level in detail. We characterize the voltage noise distributions of MCM-GPUs at different levels and under various design parameters. We further propose two architecture level voltage noise mitigation approaches, including GPM aware mitigation (GAM) and droop magnitude aware smoothing (DMAS), that leverage the voltage noise characteristics of MCM-GPUs. Evaluation shows both techniques are effective in reducing the voltage droop magnitudes and achieve good energy savings with negligible performance degradation.</description></item><item><title>DRAM Bender: An Extensible and Versatile FPGA-Based Infrastructure to Easily Test State-of-the-Art DRAM Chips</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10141996</link><description>To understand and improve DRAM performance, reliability, security, and energy efficiency, prior works study characteristics of commodity DRAM chips. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art open source infrastructures capable of conducting such studies are obsolete, poorly supported, or difficult to use, or their inflexibility limits the types of studies they can conduct. We propose DRAM Bender, a new FPGA-based infrastructure that enables experimental studies on state-of-the-art DRAM chips. DRAM Bender offers three key features at the same time. First, DRAM Bender enables directly interfacing with a DRAM chip through its low-level interface. This allows users to issue DRAM commands in arbitrary order and with finer-grained time intervals compared to other open source infrastructures. Second, DRAM Bender exposes easy-to-use C++ and Python programm ing interfaces, allowing users to quickly and easily develop different types of DRAM experiments. Third, DRAM Bender is easily extensible. The modular design of DRAM Bender allows extending it to: 1) support existing and emerging DRAM interfaces and 2) run on new commercial or custom FPGA boards with little effort. To demonstrate that DRAM Bender is a versatile infrastructure, we conduct three case studies, two of which lead to new observations about the DRAM RowHammer vulnerability. In particular, we show that data patterns supported by DRAM Bender uncover a larger set of bit-flips on a victim row than those commonly used by prior work. We demonstrate the extensibility of DRAM Bender by implementing it on five different FPGAs with DDR4 and DDR3 support. DRAM Bender is freely and openly available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/DRAM-Bender.</description></item><item><title>Realization and Hardware Implementation of Gating Units for Long Short-Term Memory Network Using Hyperbolic Sine Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10175619</link><description>This article proposes a new activation function (AF)  $\mathrm {sinh}(\beta x) + \mathrm {sinh}^{-1}(\beta x)$  called combined hyperbolic Sine (comb-H-sine) to replace existing AFS like  $\sigma $  and  $\tanh $  in long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. The comb-H-sine function is implemented using purely combinational architectures with a 16-bit data width with fixed-point representation, resulting in improved accuracy. Both software and hardware modeling are used to investigate the proposed architecture. Compared to prior works on  $\sigma $  and  $\tanh $  functions, the hardware for the comb-H-sine function shows significant improvements in power consumption, number of cells, cell area, and delay. The proposed LSTM architecture using comb-H-sine outperforms existing AFs in terms of power delay product and accuracy on various datasets.</description></item></channel></rss>
