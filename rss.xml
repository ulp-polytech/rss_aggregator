This article suggests a new spatial magnetic field configuration for transmitting coils in wireless power transfer systems to tackle these problems. The construction features a square base with a rhombus embedded inside it, along with four rectangular sides that are coiled in a noncrossing manner. This configuration ensures a consistent distribution of magnetic field in three dimensions. In order to guarantee that many UAVs are charged simultaneously without interfering with one another, the LCC-S topology is used to accomplish the characteristic of constant current at the main side and constant voltage at the output side. During UAV hovering, output dc&#8211;dc is combined with charge management to achieve hovering power supply and constant current charging with minimum size. The experimental results show that when the UAV hovers in the three-dimensional conical space volume above the WPT platform, it maintains a stable output power with an approximately constant 84.5% transmission efficiency.

Through the strategic adjustment of the input admittance, the conductance of the low-power diode decreases progressively with increasing power, while the conductance of the high-power diode increases correspondingly. This conductance-based power allocation method ensures that the power is rectified consistently by the most appropriate diode, regardless of the power level, and, thus, enables efficient rectification across an extended range. This letter presents a rectifier typology to substantiate the proposed strategy. Experimental results confirm the efficiency of the adaptive power division strategy, with the rectifier showing efficiency in excess of 60% from 5 to 29.5 dBm, giving a power dynamic range of 24.5 dB.</description></item><item><title>Conditional Sixth-Harmonic Injection to Improve the Linear Modulation Range of Three-Phase Voltage-Source Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648706</link><description>Overmoduation techniques are used to improve dc bus voltage utilization for three-phase voltage-source converters (VSCs), resulting in significant reduction in fundamental voltage gain.

The goal is to provide a low-cost and easy-implemented impedance measurement technique that does not rely on actual disturbance sources or prior controller knowledge. In this method, only two-phase sampling channels are needed to measure positive- and negative-sequence impedances of GCC at the same time. This method works well with converters employing various control strategies, and its universality is proved by theoretical analysis.

This letter leverages the spread spectrum technique in a class E inverter-driven, highly resonant system to address these challenges. However, a conventional class E inverter would be optimized toward a single frequency, and directly leading to hard switching issue when applying spread spectrum. By examining original classical class-E design method, it enriches the understanding of the design under frequency modulation scenarios. Through simulation, it investigates the tradeoffs among various goals, including efficiency, voltage stress, output ripple, and EMI reduction. It develops an IPT system according to the design strategy, achieving zero-voltage switching across a frequency modulation range of 0.95&#8211;1.05 MHz and maintaining an efficiency of 87%. This approach resulted in a 13-dB EMI reduction compared to a 1 MHz classical class E design.</description></item><item><title>A Modulation Method With Current Zero-Crossing Distortion Elimination and Voltage Balance Control for the RSHMC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645288</link><description>Hybrid multilevel converters have gained more popularity due to their unique superiority. Thus, the reduced switch hybrid multilevel (RSHMC) converter is adopted in this article which consists three H-bridge cells and a Vienna rectifier. The RSHMC converter combines the advantages of these two topologies and can output higher voltage level by adopting fewer switching devices compared with other multilevel converters. However, the Vienna rectifier of the RSHMC converter has the inherent current zero-crossing distortion (CZCD) problem, which will increase the total harmonic distortion of the grid-side current. Thus, a modulation method based on phase disposition-pulsewidth modulation is proposed to eliminate the CZCD of the RSHMC converter by selecting redundant switching states. Besides, in order to ensure the normal operation of the RSHMC converter, the proposed modulation method can also realize the voltage balance control of the floating capacitor and the neutral point which is also realized by selecting the switching states to charge or discharge. Consequently, the RSHMC converter can operate normally with balanced voltage and without CZCD after adopting the proposed modulation method. Finally, the feasibility and correctness of the proposed modulation method are verified by simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Evaluation of Capacitor Voltage Balancing Control Strategies for Multilevel DAB Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666267</link><description>Dual active bridge converter with multilevel neutral point clamped topology has shown potential to be a viable solution for medium-voltage dc systems. However, it will face a crucial challenge with regard to capacitor voltage balancing. In order to mitigate the negative effects caused by the voltage imbalance, e.g., overvoltage on certain devices, various control strategies for voltage balancing have been developed. To better design and implement the voltage balancing strategies, this article evaluates several voltage balancing approaches, i.e., modified duty cycle (MDC) method, modified phase shift and duty cycle (MPSDC) method, fixed switching state (FSS) method, and complementary switching state (CSS) method. These voltage balancing approaches have distinct characteristics in terms of dynamics, efficiency, robustness, applicability with modulation strategy, and implementation complexity. Evaluation results show that the MDC and MPSDC methods have advantage of extending to various control strategies. However, they are affected by current polarity identification, and have large current and power fluctuations. The FSS method is the most robust and the simplest one, but it also has poor dynamics. On the other hand, the CSS method can deliver smooth dynamics and high efficiency, but it relies on identifying the polarity of inductor current, and it cannot be used to the single phase shift and triple phase shift control strategies. Based on the evaluation results, the suitable applications of different voltage balancing methods are discussed.</description></item><item><title>Forced Fluorinated Liquid Cooling for Medium Voltage SiC Power Modules: Concurrently Addressing Electrical and Thermal Challenges</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638826</link><description>Enhanced insulation and superior thermal characteristics are crucial in advanced packaging for medium voltage (MV) silicon carbide (SiC) power modules. Nonetheless, the reduction in thermal resistance typically compromises insulation level due to the decreased number of insulation layers. In this paper, the forced fluorinated liquid cooling is proposed, whereby fluorinated liquid (3M FC-40) is directed into the power module, substituting silicone gel and diminishing thermal resistance. Through the utilization of forced fluorinated liquid cooling, a reduction of 21&#176;C in junction temperature at full load is demonstrated in the experiment, compared to traditional water cooled power modules. Furthermore, there is a 35.6% reduction observed in the maximum temperature rise &#916;Tj. As dissipation power is transferred from the topside of the chip to the fluorinated liquid, the possibility of unlimited stacking of direct bonded copper (DBC) is enabled to lower the electrical field, thereby facilitating insulation at the chip bottom side without any worries regarding heightened thermal resistance. Forced fluorinated liquid cooling resulted in a 39&#176;C reduction in the double-stacked DBC power module. Moreover, partial discharge (PD) detection under square wave revealed that the DBC immersed in the fluorinated liquid remains free from PD at 10 kV, a significantly higher threshold than observed with silicone gel. A higher partial discharge inception voltage (PDIV) is anticipated for double-stacked DBC when immersed in 3M FC-40. Thus, the forced fluorinated liquid cooling can be considered a promising solution for the next generation of MV SiC power modules.</description></item><item><title>A High Accuracy and Low-Cost Fatigue Life Evaluation Method for IGBTs Based on Variable-Parameter Power Cycling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648866</link><description>Fatigue life of insulated gate bipolar transistor modules (IGBTs) is critical to the reliable application during their long-term servicing. At present, time-consuming and costly power cycling tests are commonly used to obtain the fatigue life model of power electronics devices. In this article, a lower cost and higher efficiency method for the evaluation on the fatigue life of IGBTs was proposed based on variable-parameter power cycling. First, theoretical feasibility of the proposed method was discussed based on fatigue theory. Then, details concerning on the proposed method were described combining with the power cycling data obtained from electro-thermal coupling simulations. Finally, power cycling under both constant and variable parameter was carried out to IGBT modules for experimental verifications. Results dedicate that the fitted fatigue life deduced from the degradation curve of electro-thermal characteristics of IGBTs under variable-parameter power cycling was well consistent with that directly measured from constant-parameter power cycling. It results in an order of magnitude increase in test efficiency and an order of magnitude decrease in costs, which brings huge economic benefit and high efficiency to the fatigue life evaluation of IGBTs.</description></item><item><title>An Alternative Junction-to-Case Thermal Resistance Test Method for High Power Press-Pack IGBTs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660505</link><description>Press-pack insulated gate bipolar transistors (PP IGBTs) is well suited for high-voltage, high-power applications due to their double-side cooling, ease of series connection, and higher power density. It is very important to measure the junction-to-case thermal resistance (Rthjc) for evaluating thermal performance, with high accuracy. However, the existing thermal resistance test methods will have the problem of low accuracy when it is used in PP IGBTs. In this article, a new thermal resistance test method is proposed based on the transient dual-interface method (TDIM), different from traditional TDIM, which can obtain two transient thermal impedance (Zth) curves without disassembling the fixture, and determine the Rthjc through the separation point. The 4500 V 3000 A StakPak PP IGBTs is used as the measurement object. The results show that compared with the traditional TDIM, the new method is very simple to operate, and the test results are more accurate than thermocouples, which is more suitable for PP IGBTs. The single-side thermal resistance of the PP IGBTs is analyzed, and the emitter side is even worse due to the disc spring. The Rthjc calculated by single-side thermal resistance is close to the proposed method, but fluctuates widely.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated PWM-Based Active Thermal Control for Power Semiconductor Devices in Parallel Grid-Tied Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10663216</link><description>This article proposes a new active thermal control method for power semiconductor devices in parallel grid-tied inverters using coordinated pulsewidth modulation (PWM), which breaks the limitation that the PWM-based active thermal control cannot reduce the switching frequency below rated value, and therefore provides more regulation freedom to improve the reliability of power semiconductor devices. In specific, both frequency and phase shift values of PWM sequences will be adjusted coordinately to relieve the junction temperature of parallel inverters while keeping the total high-frequency harmonics at point of common coupling (PCC) to meet the quality requirement. The presented method is applicable to parallel inverters with identical or different input power. Finally, experimental results verified the performance of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Optimization and Validation of Current Sharing in IGBT Modules With Multichips in Parallel</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665971</link><description>Multichips paralleled insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) power modules are widely employed in industrial and automotive power conversion systems. The asymmetry of the circuit topology and the differences in chip characteristics are the main reasons for the unbalanced current distribution among parallel chips, leading to excessive electrical stress in power modules, which in turn forces the power modules to operate at a reduced rated current. Additionally, the unbalanced current distribution inevitably results in different chip losses, which are further amplified under high current loading conditions, causing some chips to be overheated, and significantly reducing the reliability. Optimizing the circuit topology is a common method to improve current distribution, but global changes often entail higher costs and longer development cycles. Moreover, the electrical parasitic of the fast recovery diodes (FRD) chip branches are not given sufficient attention in circuit topology research. Under rectification and blocked conditions in electric vehicles, FRDs often become the bottleneck for lifespan due to excessively high junction temperatures. Therefore, this article conducts a comparative analysis of the circuit parasitic in IGBT and FRD loops with several typical layouts, without changing the substrate and chip dimensions, and proposes a current sharing slot structure design to balance the parasitic parameters. Compared with the direct bonded copper (DBC) layout of the typical EconoDUAL power module, the optimized module reduces the current imbalance of FRD from 45.5% to 11.6% and the switching loss can be reduced by 8.6%. By adopting the current sharing groove, the parasitic parameter distribution can be further improved while maintaining a fixed DBC layout, considering the IGBT and FRD branches in concert. Finally, the steady-state and transient current sharing characteristics were verified under constant current and inverter conditions. Under constant current conditions, the temperature difference of FRD in the upper and lower parallel layout modules was reduced by 16.7&#8201;&#176;C, and the junction temperature of IGBT was significantly lowered. Under inverter conditions, the highest junction temperature of the columnar layout modules could be reduced by 10&#8201;&#176;C, and the temperature difference of FRD decreased by 62%. This article significantly optimizes the current imbalance issue through layout design, reduces the thermal equilibrium difference of the module under application conditions, and is conducive to improving the output capacity and fatigue life of the module, providing a solution for the design of power modules with high junction temperature operation capability and high-reliability.</description></item><item><title>Evaluation and MHz Converter Application of 1.2-kV Vertical GaN JFET</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638831</link><description>The 1.2 kV vertical GaN fin-channel junction field-effect transistor (JFET) is an emerging industrial device with low specific on-resistance (RON), normally-off operation, and avalanche capability. This article reports the first comprehensive evaluation of 1.2 kV, 75 m&#937; gallium nitride (GaN) JFET in converter applications. The RC-interface gate driver is optimized through the double-pulse test (DPT). To quantify the device's conduction loss, an in-situ measurement of dynamic RON is performed in a continuous DPT at steady-state. The vertical GaN JFET shows no dynamic RON issue. Subsequently, a GaN JFET-based half bridge is evaluated in a zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) buck converter under various frequencies, duty cycles, and load conditions. For comparison, similarly-rated SiC mosfet and Si IGBT are tested in the same converter. Benefitting from the lowest output capacitance and output charge, the GaN JFET requires a short deadtime and enables MHz operation in the 800-V ZVS buck converter. The GaN converter achieves a maximum efficiency of 97.7% at 1 MHz and 98.0% at 500 kHz and shows a general advantage in frequency and efficiency compared to the same converters based on SiC mosfet and Si IGBT. In addition, under the operational driver condition, the 1.2 kV GaN JFET shows a long short-circuit withstanding time of over 40 &#956;s at 800 V. These results provide key reference for the application of 1.2 kV GaN JFETs and suggest that a GaN device with proper designs can achieve excellent stability and robustness.</description></item><item><title>Miniaturized Current Shunt With High Bandwidth and Low Parasitics for High-Integrated Applications: Electro-Thermal Considerations and Co-Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638787</link><description>The development of current sensors for wide-bandgap (WBG) applications consistently emphasizes high bandwidth, minimal invasiveness, and integration. Despite the meticulous design that enables current shunts to achieve excellent performance with high bandwidth and low parasitics, their inherent bulkiness remains a significant challenge for their integration into high-integrated applications that depend on the high switching speeds of WBG power devices. This study thoroughly investigates and uncovers the tradeoff faced by traditional current shunts in balancing miniaturization and high bandwidth. Building upon this understanding, the miniaturized current shunt (MiniShunt) concept is introduced to overcome inherent limitations and achieve both high performance and compact size. To realize this concept, a physical implementation that involves the high-density stacking of multiple coupled transmission lines is presented. Additionally, a thermal network model specifically for the proposed MiniShunt configuration is developed and a comprehensive thermal analysis methodology for the current shunts is established. By applying this methodology to finite element analysis, the thermal safe operating area for the MiniShunt can be determined, further providing valuable insights into its maximum static power dissipation and maximum energy loss. These findings contribute to the development of a highly compact 9 &#215; 9-mm, 100-m&#937; current shunt with an ultrahigh bandwidth of 3 GHz, near-zero parasitic inductance, and a maximum energy loss of 2.0 J at a reference temperature rise limit of 20 &#176;C. Extensive experiments conducted in both the frequency and time domains serve to further validate the advantages of the MiniShunt in terms of its miniaturization, integration, ultrafast response, and low invasiveness for future high-integrated power electronics applications.</description></item><item><title>Insulation Capability at 10 kV, &gt;300 V/ns of a Nonlinear Resistive Polymer Nanocomposite Field-Grading Coating in a 15-kV Silicon Carbide Module</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648830</link><description>Emerging medium-voltage silicon carbide devices offer the potential to achieve more efficient and compact power electronics for grid-tied applications. However, the lack of an effective insulation solution for packaging the devices has slowed their widespread adoption. Recently, a nonlinear resistive polymer nanocomposite coating has been introduced to enhance the insulation by reducing localized electric field stress inside the modules. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the insulation capability of the polymer nanocomposite under high dv/dt. Half-bridge modules of 15-kV silicon carbide devices were packaged with the nanocomposite coating at the triple points on the module substrate. All the modules were tested free of partial discharge at 20 kV for 1 min. One module underwent a repetitive double-pulse test at 10 kV, 2 A and was switching at a peak dv/dt &gt; 300 V/ns. These findings further support the coating's potential as a viable practical solution to the insulation challenge of medium-voltage power modules.</description></item><item><title>Droop Control of Three- and Four-Leg Hybrid Parallel Inverters Based on Three-Phase Generalized Coordinate Transformation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637483</link><description>In recent years, widespread adoption of three-leg inverters has been observed. However, there is often a need for three-phase four-wire inverters to provide a neutral connection for asymmetrical loads within microgrid contexts. This article proposes a three- and four-leg hybrid inverter parallel structure to address the above issues. The aim is to fulfill the four-wire requirement under asymmetrical load conditions and mitigate the voltage unbalance problem. The article begins by investigating the output voltage balance control of three- and four-leg inverters and the control techniques of the hybrid parallel system. Deficiencies in traditional power droop control and virtual impedance control under unbalanced conditions are identified by calculating the inverter's output power under asymmetric load conditions. To address these issues, the article adopts average power droop and proposes a novel virtual impedance method. This method considers the impact of line impedance differences on the distribution accuracy of active power and unbalanced load current, effectively improving their distribution accuracy. Connecting three- and four-leg inverters in parallel, the four-leg inverter is capable of significantly reducing the zero-sequence voltage of the common load terminal and enhances three-phase voltage balance. Finally, experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the improved virtual impedance control.</description></item><item><title>An Additional Damping Torque Method for Low-Frequency Stability Enhancement of Virtual Synchronous Generators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638828</link><description>Low-frequency oscillations may occur in a virtual synchronous generator (VSG), resulting from an insufficient equivalent damping ration, which may be a serious stability issue for VSG. Thus, an additional damping ration is expected to be provided without affecting droop behaviors and the inertia response of VSG. To that end, an analytical approach based on combining a damping torque model and a small-signal model is developed to investigate the damping behaviors of the VSG. The relationship between the two models is brought to light, indicating that the damping torque model is suitable for qualitative analysis to give the contribution of different feedback loops to the system damping level. Subsequently, the latter is adopted for quantitative analysis to illustrate the damping ration of the system. Furthermore, an additional damping torque method is proposed, which can provide an extra damping ration for the system by increasing the equivalent positive damping torque and guaranteeing that the original droop characteristics and inertia are not compromised. Besides, the proposed control method is implemented by inserting an auxiliary branch into the power control loops of VSG. Experimental results verify the theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed additional damping method.</description></item><item><title>Exact Linearization Control of a Two-Stage DC&#8211;AC Converter With a Power Pulsating Buffer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638817</link><description>This article proposes to combine full feedback linearization with full state feedback and trajectory tracking control in order to obtain a high performance dc&#8211;ac boost converter. The system is composed of a boost converter, an inverter, and a power pulsation buffer, which removes the ripple from the dc-link, and allows reducing the size of its capacitor. This can improve the reliability of the system, as smaller capacitors do not need to be electrolytic. The use of full feedback linearization enables a stable controller at any point of operation, while the trajectory tracking control allows high performance tracking of the references (required for smaller capacitor values). The steady state performance and disturbance rejection capabilities are provided by the full state feedback control. In addition, the effect of parametric mismatches is analyzed, and the robustness of the proposal is validated through simulations and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>A Nonlinear Hybrid Impedance Matching Technique for Electromagnetic Exploration Transmitter With 96% Multifrequency Signal Energy Utilization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10640305</link><description>In electromagnetic exploration applications, the grounded cable and transmitting coil transducers are typical inductive loads that can cause reactive power occupation problems to power converters and limit the effective utilization of transmission signal energy. However, the existing impedance matching techniques show poor compatibility with nonlinear square voltage signals, which use multiple harmonic components to efficiently acquire geological information of multiple depths. To address these issues, a novel nonlinear hybrid impedance matching (NHIM) technique that combines a passive thyristor-controlled capacitor (TCC) and active insulated-gate bipolar transistor-controlled converter (ICC) is proposed to provide multifrequency impedance matching simultaneously under varying frequency conditions. In this article, the nonlinear matching strategy is first introduced. Then, the NHIM parameter optimal design is proposed considering the reduction of dc supply voltage requirement. After that, a cooperative control strategy is proposed, including multifrequency power calculation, impedance identification, and control reference calculation for TCC and ICC to constitute fundamental and high-frequency reactive power compensation. Finally, comparative simulations and experiments verify the cooperative design methodology of the proposed NHIM. Compared with the existing broadband matching, the proposed method ensures 12%&#8211;460% spectral amplitude enhancement and over 96% multifrequency signal energy utilization, which is a 10%&#8211;13% performance improvement over previous techniques.</description></item><item><title>A Hybrid Control for Smooth Power Direction Transition of Bidirectional Resonant CLLC Converter With Wide Voltage Gain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645296</link><description>The resonant CLLC circuit has become a mainstream choice for isolated bidirectional dc&#8211;dc converters due to its high efficiency. However, the power is inversely related to the switching frequency, resulting in a power control blind area under conditions of low gain and light load. This blind area can induce voltage oscillations during power direction transitions, potentially affecting the connected circuits and the grid. Incorporating phase-shift control can eliminate the blind area, but it also reduces efficiency. Consequently, the operational scope of phase-shift control should be minimized as much as possible. Meanwhile, the switching devices driven by frequency control differ between forward and backward modes. As an intermediate state, phase-shift control must ensure smooth transitions of the drive signal of primary and secondary sides. To address these challenges, this article analyzed the boundaries of the blind area at different gains and calculated the relationship between power and the phase-shift angle. Furthermore, it analyzed the coupling variations of frequency and phase-shift angle and achieved smooth transitions in frequency and phase-shift angle during the transition based on digital synchronous rectification control. Finally, a unified control scheme was established and verified through experiments to achieve overall high efficiency and smooth bidirectional transitions.</description></item><item><title>A Non-Resonant ZVS Four-Switch Flyback Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645305</link><description>The four-switch flyback (FSF) converter has the advantages of low switch voltage stress and zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) with the leakage inductance energy. However, if the clamping capacitor is too small, its voltage will oscillate, and the negative magnetizing current for realizing ZVS is difficult to be accurately obtained since it is generated by resonance. In this article, the clamping capacitor is intentionally designed quite large so that its voltage keeps nearly constant. The resultant converter is called nonresonant ZVS FSF converter. The operating principle of the converter is analyzed, and the method to accurately control the negative magnetizing current is proposed, which not only minimizes the magnetizing current ripple, but also realizes ZVS for all the power switches. Finally, a 400-W prototype is built and tested in the lab, and experimental results are provided to verify the operating principle of the FSF converter and the proposed control method.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Intelligent Control Using Hippocampus-Based Fuzzy Neural Networks for Active Power Filter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645310</link><description>To tackle harmonic issue in the power grid, an intelligent control scheme consists of fast integral terminal sliding-mode control and hippocampus-based fuzzy neural network (HBFNN) is proposed and applied to active power filter (APF) to eliminate harmonics in this article.

Afterwards, a fast integral terminal sliding-mode controller is developed for APF. The system stability is subsequently proved according to Lyapunov stability criterion, and the finite-time convergence of tracking error is certified. In addition, based on the biological structure and characteristics of the hippocampus, an innovative HBFNN is constructed to approximate the controller. Furthermore, the adaptive laws derived by the Lyapunov's theorem can realize the automatic adjustment of parameters and ensure closed-loop stability. Ultimately, relevant simulation and experimental results corroborate the availability and superiority of the designed intelligent control strategy in harmonic elimination.</description></item><item><title>Active Power Decoupling Control for Three-Level Buck Four-Leg Current Source Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10652896</link><description>Significant pulsating power exists on the dc side of three-phase four-wire inverters in the case of unbalanced or nonlinear loads, which will degrade the power quality of the dc side voltage.

These unique characteristics introduce challenges to the impedance matching of ULF electroacoustic transducer. In other words, advanced impedance matching strategies to simultaneously maintain high transmission efficiency and broadband acoustic radiation are untapped. To address these issues, a controllable T-type broadband impedance matching network (CTIMN) is proposed here. First, the matching principle of CTIMN is newly developed by deriving two equivalent circuits from both the output of power amplifier and the input of ULF electroacoustic transducer. Then, the parameter design method based on the exhaustive method is proposed to yield the optimal parametric design for CTIMN. Combined with the adaptive proportional-resonant control strategy, the operating principle of CTIMN is illustrated.

However, there exists a tradeoff between disturbance rejection and noise immunity for traditional linear ESO (TLESO). Compared to TLESO with similar bandwidth, phase-locking loop observer (PLLO) exhibits a better output tracking performance but weaker noise suppression capability. By combining the advantages of TLESO and PLLO, an adaptive LESO (ALESO) is proposed in this article, which utilizes TLESO in steady state and PLLO during transient state. The dynamic and noise-suppression performances of different observers are analyzed and compared systematically. The proposed ALESO inherits good dynamic response of PLLO and noise-suppression performance of TLESO, without using high bandwidth. It also possesses the advantages of simple structure, requiring few tuning parameters and ease of parameter tuning. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed ALESO design, it is employed to a 500 W dual-active-bridge dc&#8211;dc converter for pulsed power applications. Experiments results show that, in comparison with TLESO, the proposed ALESO has resulted in 33.3%/37% and 60%/73.3% reductions in output voltage undershoot/overshoot and setting time, respectively, under load step-up/down.

However, the nonidentical high-frequency link (HFL) inductor is unavoidable, causing mutual interferences among submodules, and deteriorating the decoupling and voltage balance performances of conventional IVS strategies. Thus, a general decoupling IVS control strategy is proposed for ISOP DAB converter with nonidentical HFL inductors. First, an improved small-signal state-space model of ISOP DAB converter with a full-rank matrix is proposed to present the coupled performance of the ISOP DAB converter with nonidentical HFL inductors. Based on the improved model, a general decoupling method is proposed by invertible and gain-regulated matrices to achieve a diagonal matrix with uniform diagonal elements in the small-signal model, revealing and solving the sneak coupled performances among control loops. Next, a decoupling IVS control strategy is proposed by shaping full-order input impedance to solve the issues and coupled effects of multiple modes in the operation submodules. Then, the IVS controller is designed and detailed in the frequency and time domains, achieving input voltage balance and avoiding oscillation among submodules with better dynamics and more stable responsiveness. Moreover, the better characteristics of input impedance, output impedance, and input voltages in the proposed decoupling IVS control strategy are discussed and compared with traditional strategies. Finally, experiments are set up to verify the proposed general decoupling IVS control strategy for ISOP DAB converter with nonidentical HFL inductors.</description></item><item><title>Design and Validation of a Multioutput Wireless Power Transfer System Using MPC Controller</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10706646</link><description>This article presents a novel approach that combines Kalman filtering and model predictive control (MPC) algorithms to achieve stable output in a multioutput wireless power transfer (WPT) system for automated guided vehicles (AGVs).

However, existing temperature evaluation methods cannot accurately evaluate the temperature distribution of chips under surge conditions. This article proposes an experimental-simulation iterative modeling method, which is based on the electro-thermal coupling finite element model to simulate and calculate the temperature distribution of diode chips under surge conditions. The simulated I-V trajectory and temperature distribution are in good agreement with the experimental results. In addition, by monitoring the degradation of electrical characteristic parameters of diode chips under surge conditions and analyzing the scanning electron microscope results of failed chips, it was concluded that the single surge limit of the chip can be determined by the occurrence of aluminum electromigration phenomenon, and the critical conditions for the chip to reach the surge limit were quantitatively determined with the assistance of simulation results. Finally, based on the proposed temperature evaluation method, the relationship between the number of chip bonding wires and the surge limit was obtained.</description></item><item><title>A Compact, Single Stage, &gt;1 kV Medium-Voltage Line Impedance Stabilization Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643328</link><description>This article presents the design of a single-phase, single-stage line impedance stabilization network (LISN) for medium-voltage (MV) applications. More than 1 kV rated wide-bandgap (WBG) power semiconductor switches are increasingly utilized in new, emerging power electronics energy systems to improve power density and efficiency. However, due to inherently fast-switching speeds, WBG switch modules emit considerable electromagnetic interference (EMI) (e.g., common mode or differential mode). State-of-the-art offers standardized LISN solutions to validate and certify the new energy system for electromagnetic compatibility. However, most are for low voltage applications (i.e., &lt; 1 kV). MV LISNs (i.e., &gt; 1 kV) are rare until recently and literature does not provide sufficient guidelines for designing and characterizing such devices. It has been a critical challenge for many scientists and engineers to reliably certify the emerging MV energy systems (e.g., electric ships and aircraft). This article addresses such a technology gap. Specifically, a CISPR 16-1-2 compliant 50 &#937;/50 &#181;H LISN with 1.5 kV, 75 A and 30 MHz measurement capability has been proposed. Detailed performance study versus non-linear parasitic parameters variations in MV inductors and capacitors have been done. Based on new understandings, novel techniques to intuitively mitigate unwanted parasitic have been proposed to develop the proposed LISN successfully. Thorough characterization of important LISN parameters are presented and factors influencing them are analyzed. A rigorous analysis, experimental tests, and in-depth comparisons over state-of-the-art have been made to validate the effectiveness. This is done through the state-of-the-art 300 kVA MV EMI testbed.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Analysis of a Novel Distributed Magnetic-Pole Permanent Magnet Planetary Machine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531764</link><description>A novel distributed magnetic pole permanent magnet planetary machine (DMPPMPM) is proposed in this article, which has the advantages of high power density, high integration, reliable transmission, and simple controllability.

In view of the drag reduction requirements of micro vehicles, a piezoelectric traveling wave drag reducer (PTWDR) is proposed in this article. The PTWDR can be embedded into the surface of micro vehicles, with the merits of small size, high drag reduction efficiency and low energy consumption. We analyzed the structural changes of turbulent flow field caused by the actuation of PTWDR, and revealed the turbulent drag reduction mechanism. The control parameters selecting method to achieve required drag reduction performance under different operating conditions are proposed. The good drag reduction effects in various regions of the vehicles can be achieved by reasonably arranging PTWDR. The friction drag and total drag experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of PTWDR in achieving drag reduction, and the maximum drag reduction rate can reach 58%. Finally, the energy saving efficiency of PTWDR are studied, and it is confirmed that PTWDR can achieve net energy savings. This study provides an important reference for on-demand active drag reduction and net energy saving of micro vehicles.</description></item><item><title>Robust Control System Tuner and Cascaded Adaptive Vectorial Filter-Based PV-Battery System With a Dual-Loop ANF-PLL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10528786</link><description>This article presents a three-phase, single-stage photovoltaic (PV) system with a battery energy storage (BES) that functions in both grid-tied and islanded modes.

A parameter-switching methodology with the selected scheduling parameter is provided and the visual analyses of performance guarantees are analyzed. MADRC-gs is applied to a practical denitrification process of an in-service 660MW power plant. Actual operational data illustrate that MADRC-gs can reduce hourly average integral absolute error by about 22.61% and 43.18% in high-load and low-load ranges, respectively. Even though the power plant experiences lifting and lowering powers frequently, MADRC-gs can still obtain better control performance compared to the original controller and MADRC, and show a promising application potential in energy and chemical industries.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Round-Robin Protocol-Based Secondary Control for ESSs Under FDI Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538177</link><description>This article focuses on the distributed secondary control problem for energy storage systems (ESSs) under false data injection (FDI) attacks. To solve the problem, a $\boldsymbol{k}$-step attack estimation method is first proposed to estimate the unknown attacks and the estimation error converges to zero as the number of estimation steps increases to infinity. Next, we design a Round-Robin (RR) communication protocol to alleviate the communication burden among ESSs. Based on the estimator state and the RR communication protocol, a distributed secondary security controller is proposed by introducing a time-varying gain for each ESS. Different from the existing secondary control results on ESSs, the developed result can achieve state of charge (SoC) balancing and proportional power-sharing with restricted communication under FDI attacks. It is shown that the SoC balancing and proportional power-sharing objectives can be achieved under the developed methods. Finally, a real-time experiment is introduced to show the effectiveness of the developed methods.</description></item><item><title>Self-Adjusting Domain Adversarial Transfer Learning Algorithm for Power Transformer Lifetime Prediction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10546914</link><description>Accurate prediction of the remaining useful lifetime of power transformers plays a crucial role in effective operation and health maintenance of the entire power grid. Machine-learning based data-driven solution is effective on mitigating the high financial and time costs induced by traditional prediction schemes, however, this solution is limited by data distribution, data volume, data quality, and variations of prediction scenarios, making it difficult to achieve good prediction performance. To address this concern, a self-adjusting domain adversarial transfer learning (SDATL) algorithm for power transformer lifetime prediction is first proposed in this article. It extracts features from source and target domains by stacked convolution sparse auto-encoder (SCSAE), measures distributions of source and target domains by the adversarial domain adaptive module. Furthermore, it implements advantageous transfer learning after determining the transfer object. Moreover, the parametric linear rectification unit (PReLU) adaptive adjustment module is designed and constructed to further improve the prediction accuracy by optimizing the network structure through network transfer and iteration. The proposed SDATL network is evaluated by using condition monitoring data from six dry-type transformers and compared with existing prevalence data-driven algorithms. The evaluation and comparison results validate higher prediction accuracy and better adaptability of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>A Fractional-Order Gradient Neural Solution to Time-Variant Quadratic Programming With Application to Robot Motion Planning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10551266</link><description>This article proposes the fractional-order gradient neural network (FO-GNN) model for time-variant quadratic programming (TVQP) problems, marking the first integration of fractional calculus into neural solver design for cyclic motion planning in robotics. The FO-GNN evolves from traditional GNNs by employing fractional gradient operators, thus bypassing the differentiation typically required in zeroing neural networks (ZNNs). This innovation leads to a streamlined computational approach and convergence that does not rely on the convexity of the energy function. Compared to ZNN, standard GNN, and MATLAB&#8217;s quadprog, the FO-GNN offers enhanced precision and expedited convergence for both time-invariant and TVQP challenges.

The reliability of the SST is crucial. However, active switches are prone to failures, which can have severe consequences. For the matrix-type SST (MT-SST), the time-varying dc-link voltage poses challenges for accurate and rapid fault diagnosis. This article proposes a comprehensive fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control method for the open-circuit (OC) fault of a single switch in MT-SST. By comparing the estimated and measured values of the resonant capacitor voltages, the algorithm identifies the OC fault. Additionally, a reduction in the duty cycle of specific switches is introduced to assist in fault localization through monitoring of voltage changes. However, this method can only identify the OC fault on one side of MT-SST when the direction of power flow remains constant. To ensure fault tolerance, the primary and secondary side full-bridge is reconfigured into a quasi-half-bridge structure. The developed methods have the advantages simplicity and reliability. Finally, a 1.5 kW prototype is built, and the validity and feasibility of the proposed methods are verified.</description></item><item><title>Parameter Estimation of DAB Converter Using Intelligent Algorithms and Steady-State Modeling Considering Nonidealities</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10546328</link><description>Parameter estimation of dual active bridge (DAB) converters is a powerful tool in the applications of fault location, modulation strategy optimization, and preventive maintenance. However, most of the existing parameter estimation techniques often rely on costly experimental measurements and only estimate some converter parameters. To address these problems, we apply intelligence techniques to propose a flexible, generalized, and reliable multiparametric estimation methodology. Specifically, the circuit nonidealities, including the dead-time effect and the power loss, are considered to derive accurate open-loop and closed-loop steady-state models of the DAB converter. Then, the dynamic behavior and stability of the DAB converter are investigated based on those theoretical models. Next, a back-propagation (BP) neural network optimized by the genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to establish training models. Notably, the datasets used in training are generated from the derived DAB models, eliminating the need for parameter data collection from different converters. Finally, the accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability of the GA-BP are compared with traditional estimation methodologies and the pretrained BP model. Illustrative results demonstrate that the proposed intelligent approach is an effective approach for parameter estimation.</description></item><item><title>Online Bridge-Level Junction Temperature Evaluation of IGBTs via Emitter Parasitic Inductance Voltage Undershoot</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10530860</link><description>Insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) junction temperature evaluation is vital for health assessment. However, most of the existing IGBT junction temperature (Tj) evaluation approaches require the same number of detecting units and IGBTs. In this article, a thermosensitive electrical parameter based on the turn-off induced voltage veE undershoot between Kelvin and power emitters of lower IGBT for two IGBTs junction temperatures estimation in half-bridge module is proposed, which is independent of bond wires fatigue. The veE ringing of lower IGBT under designed time sequence has a good linear dependency with Tj of upper and lower IGBTs. An improved peak detector circuit is designed to extract the veE with no disruption to normal operation. Double-pulse test and three-phase converter platforms are built to verify the feasibility of industrial applications. Calibration results show that there is good linearity and high sensitivity between IGBT junction temperature and veE undershoot under various working conditions. Besides, the approach has high accuracy in junction temperature monitoring validated by infrared. Therefore, this novel bridge-level Tj estimation method has a good commercial prospect.</description></item><item><title>Interleaved Switching for Loss Minimization in Adjacent Cell-to-Cell Balancing Architectures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521813</link><description>The cell-to-cell variation in capacity and impedance leads to a charge imbalance within the battery pack, which tends to degrade its various states and the available energy. Therefore, a Battery Management System (BMS) equipped with a charge equalization circuit (CEC) will enhance the overall performance of the pack, resulting in improved electric range and grid storage capacity. The adjacent cell-to-cell (AC2C) architecture has a higher equalization loss because charge distribution is limited between adjacent cells and the hard-switching operation of their connected CECs. A charge equalization algorithm where interleaved switching of CECs with variable duty control is proposed in this article. The proposed switching operation improves the equalization loss by regulating the equalization current (rms and average) relative to the balanced state of the individual cell. To study the equalization performance for diverse scenarios of imbalance, a 48 V, 20 Ah pack with AC2C buck-boost CEC is configured in the PLECS simulation environment, where the proposed algorithm has achieved around 32% reduction in equalization loss. For experimental validation, an 18 V, 10.4 Ah LCO battery pack connected to the BMS and a series AC2C equalization unit are developed for the balancing operations.</description></item><item><title>A Digital Twin Approach for Online Impedance-Based Stability Analysis of Three-Phase AC Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10541872</link><description>In contemporary electrical distribution systems, multiple parallel inverters collaborate to form an advanced power distribution network, which poses stability challenges. Small-signal analysis is a fundamental method for characterizing interactions between system impedances. In three-phase ac systems, stability assessment involves examining the source-to-load impedance ratio in the complex dq plane using the Generalized Nyquist criterion (GNC). In this context, the digital twin (DT) concept is arising as the forefront of energy sector digitization, providing real-time data through high-fidelity models mirroring physical systems. This article presents a stability analysis method employing a DT approach to determine the closed-loop impedance of the physical system and estimate the connected system's equivalent impedance. Broadband excitation based on pseudorandom binary sequences (PRBS) is applied with Fourier techniques for frequency response extraction. Impedance ratio assessment is performed on an edge-computing platform, delivering real-time stability information. Experimental results are provided for a dual-hybrid converter, one operating as a grid-forming system and the other in grid-following mode. The outcomes demonstrate the feasibility and potential of the proposal as a foundational approach to enhance robustness based on stability indexes.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Step-Wave AC Voltage Collection System for Renewable Energy Sources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10530354</link><description>To further reduce the losses and footprint of the key power conversion equipment in the conventional sine-wave alternating current (ac) voltage collection system for renewable energy sources, a novel step-wave ac voltage collection system is proposed in this letter, where the voltage on the point of common coupling (PCC) is regulated as a four-level step wave by sending end converter (SEC). With this particular waveform, the semiconductor switches in SEC are able to operate at only line frequency and two-level voltage source converter (VSC) can be used to eliminate the bulky capacitor of the MMC submodule. Therefore, the switching losses are significantly reduced compared with the conventional sine-wave voltage converters. Moreover, the direct current (dc) voltage utilization is improved by 10%. The power loss of the whole collection system can be reduced by 27.2% compared with the traditional sine-wave system using MMC. The effectiveness of the proposed system is verified by simulation and a 500&#160;W prototype.</description></item><item><title>Operating-Point-Parameterized State-Space Models of Black-Boxed Grid-Following Inverters for Maximum Transferable Active Power Prediction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10541860</link><description>This letter introduces an efficient method for analytically predicting the maximum transferable active power (MTAP) of a grid-following inverter (GFLI), considered as a black box, under any arbitrary short circuit ratio (SCR), X/R ratio, and reactive power injection level. By measuring the GFLI's admittance at several different operating points, an operating-point-parameterized state-space model (OPP SSM) is developed and exploited to predict the MTAP. The proposed method obviates the need for repetitive electromagnetic transient time-domain simulations or frequency-domain impedance criteria by gradually increasing active power output until the MTAP is reached. The feasibility of the synthesized OPP SSM for MTAP prediction has been experimentally validated on a power-controlled GFLI, demonstrating its potential for aiding the integration of inverter-based resources in modern power systems.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Two-Stage Benders Decomposition and Dual Dynamic Programming for Hydrothermal-Wind Planning With Intra-Stage Cost Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552437</link><description>The continuous increase of renewable energy sources (RES) brings challenges to electric power system planning, since RES effects must be considered in both short-term dispatch and mid/long-term planning (MLTP). In the latter, immediate or intra-stage cost functions (ICF or ISCF) have been proposed in the literature to provide thermal generation costs for each weekly/monthly stage, to address the uncertainty and high variability of RES without explicitly discretizing the stage in hourly steps. This work proposes a combined two-stage Benders decomposition and dual dynamic programming (DDP) approach to improve the construction and consideration of such ISCF for the MLTP problem. In this case, a set of subproblems considering hourly aspects as load curve, RES intermittency and peak capacity of hydro-generation are iteratively solved in the DDP master problem of each stage, for several scenarios of RES generation profiles, along DDP iterations. Since the discretization points of the ISCF are obtained on demand, this approach yields more accurate ISCF functions, specially in multi-area systems. The methodology is validated for both a tutorial case and a case based on data from the large-scale Brazilian system, where more realistic mid-term policies are obtained when compared to current approaches, with a reduced number of subproblems.</description></item><item><title>Graph Spatio-Temporal Networks for Condition Monitoring of Wind Turbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552429</link><description>Condition monitoring of wind turbines (WTs) is essential for advancing wind energy. Existing data-driven methods heavily rely on deep learning and big data, leading to challenges in distinguishing true faults from false alarms, impacting operational decisions negatively. Thus, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph neural network framework that incorporates prior knowledge. Prior WT knowledge is utilized by establishing a spatially structured directed graph embedded in a graph attention network (GAT). The features in WTs&#8217; supervisory control and data acquisition system are indicated by the nodes in GAT. Then, the global and local attention embedding layers as well as long short-term memory layers are employed to combine spatio-temporal information from each node. Finally, the condition monitoring in WTs&#8217; graph and node-level are established, and a fault propagation chain at node-level is constructed for explaining condition monitoring results. To demonstrate the explainability, robustness and sensitivity of the proposed approach, a comparative analysis between a true fault case and a false alarm case are given, and anomaly detection results are also reported.</description></item><item><title>Nonlinear Behavior and Transient Stability of Grid-Following Converters Using Direct Power Control Under Weak Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555420</link><description>Ensuring reliable operation of renewable energy sources requires robust grid-connected converters. Depending on the choice of synchronization methods, grid-connected converters may exhibit distinct nonlinear behavior that plays a vital role in determining their transient stability. Recently, the grid-voltage-modulated direct power control (DPC) has been proposed as an alternative to the conventional phase-locked loop (PLL) to enhance the dynamic response of the grid-following converter (GFLC). However, existing studies have primarily treated the DPC-based GFLC as a linear system. In this paper, we investigate the nonlinear behavior of this converter under weak grids using a large-signal model based on double reference frames. Our findings reveal that the DPC-based GFLC demonstrates sustained oscillation. Interestingly, the stable periodic orbit observed does not arise from a Hopf bifurcation but rather a saddle-node bifurcation of periodic orbits. This critical bifurcation is characterized by the coexistence of a stable periodic orbit and a stable equilibrium point, resulting in a sudden contraction of the converter's stability region. Furthermore, we provide a comparison between the nonlinear behavior of PLL-based GFLCs and DPC-based GFLCs. To validate our findings, we present full-circuit simulations and laboratory experiments.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Functional Integrated Converter for Dynamic Voltage Restoration and Reactive Power Compensation in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555312</link><description>Conventionally, parallel-connected or series-connected power quality control devices cannot compensate for both the voltage fluctuation and reactive power simultaneously. To improve the equipment utilization and reliability of the existing power quality control devices, a multi-functional integrated converter (MFIC) is proposed, which can effectively integrate the functions of both dynamic voltage restoration and reactive power compensation. When the grid voltage sags or swells, the MFIC works in the series access mode to achieve voltage regulation function. When the grid voltage is normal, the MFIC works in the parallel access mode to achieve unity power factor operation at the grid side. Compared with the traditional series-connected power quality control device, the MFIC only has one more coupling capacitor, markedly improving the utilization factor of equipment. In addition, the port voltage of the converter module in MFIC is clamped to zero when a short circuit or grounding fault occurs. Meanwhile, a large equivalent impedance is formed to effectively limit the line fault current, which improves the reliability of the MFIC itself and its connected grid as well. Furthermore, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed topology and strategy are verified by simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Power System Decarbonization: A Comparison Between Carbon Taxes and Forcing Coal Power Plant Retirements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555380</link><description>The U.S. power system faces a 2035 decarbonization target, though the exact pathway to the target remains unclear. Policy instruments, like carbon taxes and forcing coal plants to retire through various mechanisms, could help achieve the target. It is critical to analyze and compare decarbonization policies as different policies lead to different costs, emissions pathways, and political challenges. In this paper, we explore the ramifications of adopting alternative decarbonization policies. We assume a particular carbon tax to be the benchmark policy and compare it to alternative carbon tax and forced coal retirement policies in terms of emissions and costs. We use a power system dispatch model that co-optimizes unit commitment, energy, and frequency regulation capacity to simulate system evolution over multiple years, including retirements and renewables/storage expansion, under each policy. Our case study highlights the trade-offs between policies. We find that, counter-intuitively, higher carbon taxes do not always achieve lower emissions due to the complexity of dispatch, resulting profits and retirements, and the addition of renewables/storage. In contrast, forced coal retirements result in lower power system costs but higher emissions than the benchmark policy, with a large range of possible outcomes across different retirement cases.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Multistage Distribuionally Robust Programming to Hydrothermal Economic Dispatch With Renewable Energy Sources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561496</link><description>The multistage solution is very important to achieve optimal hydrothermal economic dispatch considering the uncertainty of renewable energy sources. In data-driven settings, only some historical trajectories are available and the probability distribution is unknown. A data-driven scheme for multistage stochastic hydrothermal economic dispatch with Markovian uncertainties is proposed in this paper. Then a data-driven distributionally robust stochastic dual dynamic programming (DDR-SDDP) is proposed to tackle the corresponding computational intractability, where the conditional probability distributions are estimated by using kernel regression. The out-of-sample performances are improved by distributionally robust optimization on a Wasserstein distance-based ambiguity set. Furthermore, a scenario aggregation method is designed to reduce the computational burden. Numerical results for a practical regional power system in China are presented and analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Co-Optimizing Distributed Energy Resources in Linear Complexity Under Net Energy Metering</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568387</link><description>The co-optimization of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources is considered for prosumers under the net energy metering tariff. The distributed energy resources considered include renewable generations, flexible demands, and battery energy storage systems. An energy management system co-optimizes the consumptions and battery storage based on locally available stochastic renewables by solving a stochastic dynamic program that maximizes the expected operation surplus. To circumvent the exponential complexity of the dynamic program solution, we propose a closed-form and linear computation complexity co-optimization algorithm based on a relaxation-projection approach to a constrained stochastic dynamic program. Sufficient conditions for optimality for the proposed solution are obtained. Numerical studies demonstrate orders of magnitude reduction of computation costs and significantly reduced optimality gap.</description></item><item><title>Control and Power Balancing of an Off-Grid Wind Turbine With Co-Located Electrolyzer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10569094</link><description>Co-locating electrolyzers and offshore wind can significantly reduce the cost of green hydrogen. However, without a grid connection, a new control paradigm is required for the electrolyzer to follow the variable power supplied by the wind turbine. Commercial electrolyzers have power ramp rate limitations, which can result in a mismatch between the wind turbine and electrolyzer power, leading to frequent shutdown and potentially unstable operation. This paper is the first to develop a control system for this off-grid operation with three mechanisms to dynamically balance the power, including energy storage, rotor inertia, and enhanced pitch control. The results show that a $6.8 million supercapacitor is required with a power rating and capacity of approximately 6.7 MW and 8.5 kWh to enable the system to operate through 99% of the annual wind variation. If the electrolyzer ramp rates can be doubled, the same operating hours can be achieved using only control-based power balancing methods at the cost of a marginal reduction in energy production. If commercial electrolyzer ramp rates can be tripled, the system is able to operate without the need for any power balancing.</description></item><item><title>Real-World Scale Deployment of Hydrogen-Integrated Microgrid: Design and Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571822</link><description>The development and utilization of hydrogen hold the potential to revolutionize new power systems by providing a clean and versatile energy carrier.

Addition of energy storage systems in an IBR power plant makes it feasible to have frequency control at the power plant level. While frequency control appears as a simple frequency-power droop control to adjust real power commands to inverter-level controls with measured frequency as an input, care must be taken to avoid interactions among the plant frequency control with communication delays, inverter-level control effects, and the frequency sensor, usually a phase-locked-loop (PLL). This paper present two types of interaction scenarios that makes frequency control design challenging. The first interaction scenario may occur if the frequency control's gain is large, while the second interaction scenario may occur at a small control gain if the plant-level PLL lacks sufficient damping. We contribute to the fundamental understanding of the causation of stability issues due to plant frequency control through the derivation of a simplified feedback system focusing on the frequency and power relationship, and the follow-up frequency-domain analysis for gaining insights. For validation, we also design a data-driven approach to obtain models from data generated from an electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation testbed. The findings from analysis have all been validated by EMT simulation. Finally, we contribute to mitigating strategies and also the understanding of the role of additional proportional integration power feedback control. This addition has been demonstrated as an efficient stability enhancement strategy to mitigate the effect of communication delay.</description></item><item><title>Differential Power Processing Based Control Framework for Multiple Battery Energy Storage Systems in DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10579077</link><description>Multiple battery energy storage systems (BESSs) have been widely used in the DC microgrids to balance generation and demand. To achieve this, the BESS converters need to deliver the full required input/output power imposed on BESSs under the conventional BESS-DC bus configuration, which often demands high power ratings for the converters, hence leads to high installation cost as well as high power losses. To reduce the power ratings for BESS converters while delivering the same power from BESSs, this paper proposes a new differential power processing (DPP) based control framework where the DPP techniques and BESSs are firstly combined without losing the following control objectives, namely, the accurate current-sharing and state of charge (SoC) balance of BESSs as well as DC bus voltage regulation. This is achieved first by introducing inverted bidirectional buck converters to function as a front-end converter and DPP converters. Then, a virtual state variable combining BESS output current and its SoC is proposed, based on which a consensus control strategy is proposed. The stability of the proposed DPP-based control framework is also analyzed. Finally, the real-time hardware-in-loop (HIL) tests confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control framework, showing that the proposed DPP-based control framework reduces the power ratings of the converters to less than 20 $\%$ of BESS converters used in conventional BESS-DC bus configuration even in the worst operating scenario, while delivering the same required power from BESSs, paving a way for an innovative BESS DC microgrid design with much down-sized converters for BESSs.</description></item><item><title>Replicating Power Flow Constraints Using Only Smart Meter Data for Coordinating Flexible Sources in Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10584114</link><description>The increasing integration of distributed energy resources necessitates effective coordination of flexible sources within distribution networks. Traditional model-based approaches require accurate topology and line parameters, which are often unavailable. Neural constraint replication can bypass this requirement, but it relies on complete nodal and branch measurements. However, in practice, only partial buses are monitored, while branches often remain unmeasured. To address this issue, this paper proposes a topology identification-incorporated neural constraint replication to replicate power flow constraints with only partial nodal measurements. Utilizing the additive property of line parameters, we develop a recursive bus elimination algorithm to recover topology and line impedance from power injection and voltage measurements on limited buses. We then estimate missing voltage and branch flow measurements based on the recovered model information. By combining observed and estimated measurements to construct training sets, we train neural networks to replicate voltage and branch flow constraints, which are subsequently reformulated into mixed-integer linear programming forms for efficient solving. Monte-Carlo simulations on various test systems demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed method, even with limited nodal measurements.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Power Tracking Performance and Small Signal Stability Analysis of Integrated Wind-to-Hydrogen System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10582460</link><description>To achieve the 2050 global climate target, offshore wind will increase to meet the growing demand of direct and indirect electrification (e.g. green hydrogen production for the hard-to-abate sector). To keep up with the rapid increase of offshore wind generation, the energy balancing challenges due to the intermittency nature of wind and the network congestion/capacity challenges resulting from structural network capacity planning latency are to be addressed with system integration technology. In this paper, it is proposed that the hydrogen electrolysis plant be co-located with the wind farm, where the power consumption is controlled to track the wind generation profile accurately to cancel the intermittency of wind generation, reduce the required grid connection capacity, and thereby avoid expensive grid expansion. However, this power tracking controller introduces a cross-plant feedback path from the wind farm to the hydrogen plant, posing challenges for partitioning the power tracking loop completely for stability analysis, which also makes it difficult to make a good trade-off between the tracking performance and stability margins. To address this issue, this paper proposes an equivalent transformation to eliminate the cross-plant feedback path. Then, the criteria for choosing the optimal partition method are proposed and examined for different types of partition methods, which are mathematically proven to be equivalent in terms of stability conditions but provide different insights. An optimal partition method is then proposed in this paper, which not only provides clear insight on the ideal and non-ideal power tracking performances but also can also identify the stability issues of different minor loops individually. Finally, the proposed optimal partition method and its valuable insights into power tracking performance and stability analysis are validated through time-domain simulations of a 180 MW integrated wind-to-hydrogen plant with a realistic complexity.</description></item><item><title>Toward on Rolling Optimal Dispatch Strategy Considering Alert Mechanism for Antarctic Electricity-Hydrogen-Heat Integrated Energy System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10582516</link><description>Renewable energy will be the important form of energy supply for future Antarctic scientific research station. This will complicate the dispatch of the Antarctic integrated energy system (IES), due to the harsh operation environment and diverse operation situation of the Antarctic system, especially for the problem of equipment outage caused by extreme weather. To cope with that, a rolling optimal dispatch method considering alert mechanism for Antarctic integrated energy system is proposed in this paper. First, the output of the proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is characterized by the feasible region and converted into a linear P-H-T model. By introducing the alert mechanism, a rolling optimal dispatch strategy is then established to ensure the security operation of the Antarctic integrated energy system. Furthermore, the normalized multiparametric disaggregation technology (NMDT) is presented to deal with the bilinear terms in dispatching formulation, in which a mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) is converted into mixed integer linear programming (MILP). Finally, case study is verified on the actual Antarctic energy system. The results indicates that the proposed fuel cell P-H-T model can enhance the flexibility and economy of the operation system. Also the load shedding can be reduced during the emergency operation by developed optimal dispatch strategy, which improves the resilience of IES.</description></item><item><title>Improving Resiliency of Cyber-Dependent Power Distribution Network Using UAVs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10587086</link><description>Resiliency enhancement of the power distribution network (PDN) through restoration is paramount in the face of escalating natural disasters. State-of-the-art literature has centered on augmenting resiliency through network reconfiguration, along with the integration of renewable energy resources (RES) and mobile energy storage systems (MESS). However, these approaches often assume an intact communication infrastructure, a premise that fails to address the damage in the cyber or communication network (CN). This study introduces the integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for wireless communication in the aftermath of communication infrastructure damage. Motivated by this, a comprehensive mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem-based restoration framework is proposed, aiming to elevate PDN resiliency considering a cyber-dependent PDN. This approach encompasses network reconfiguration, MESS, and UAV integration. The proposed method's efficacy is evaluated through rigorous testing and validation on the cyber-dependent IEEE 33 bus system and IEEE 123 bus system. This work pioneers a holistic approach to PDN resiliency, considering communication challenges often overlooked.</description></item><item><title>Fault Current Limiting and Grid Code Compliance for Grid-Forming Inverters&#8212;Part I: Problem Statement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589298</link><description>Grid-forming (GFM) inverters are controlled to directly regulate the voltage. A major challenge stemming from this control model is that sustaining the voltage during faults would require high currents&#8212;beyond the levels that an inverter can withstand. Various fault current limiting (FCL) methods have been developed in recent years for GFM inverter-based resources (IBRs). The theoretical analysis supported by detailed simulation studies in Part I of this paper investigates whether existing FCL methods for GFM inverters can be deemed feasible solutions for future IBR-centric power grids. The challenges revealed for the first time in this paper are multifaceted and depend on the type of the FCL method. The focus is not only on a GFM inverter's internal operation, but also on its impact on the grid and the practical requirements for grid integration of an IBR considering most recent grid codes. Part II of this paper will address these challenges.</description></item><item><title>Fault Current Limiting and Grid Code Compliance for Grid-Forming Inverters &#8212; Part II: Solution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589281</link><description>Part I of this paper unveiled various shortcomings of existing fault current limiting (FCL) methods for grid-forming (GFM) inverters. Part II of this paper develops a new FCL method that overcomes these drawbacks. Additionally, the FCL method proposed in this paper follows the strict requirements of recent grid codes for the low-voltage ride-through mode of inverter-based resources (IBRs). This makes the exact response of GFM inverters during faults fully predictable. Such predictability is a prerequisite for the reliable design/setting of protection systems, operation, and planning of power grids with high penetration of IBRs. The paper uses PSCAD simulations to corroborate if the proposed method meets these objectives. It also uses simulation results to compare this new method with existing FCL solutions for GFM inverters.</description></item><item><title>Per-Phase Unsymmetrical Adaptive Derivative Optimized Droop for Mitigating Voltage Quality Issues of Unbalanced Islanded Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589303</link><description>The proliferation of unbalanced linear and nonlinear loads in microgrids degrades the voltage quality at the inverter terminals, and thus, load terminals receive unbalanced and distorted voltages. To alleviate these voltage quality issues, this paper proposes a per-phase unsymmetrical adaptive derivative optimized droop control scheme for unbalanced islanded microgrids (UIMG). The proposed controller is coupled with a per-phase unsymmetrical virtual impedance (UVI) to mitigate the unbalance of the inverter-based UIMG. Additionally, a proportional multi-resonant (PMR) controller is adopted to compensate for the voltage distortion. To improve the UIMG dynamics response while changing the loading states, derivative terms of active and reactive powers are added to the proposed control. The derivative gains are adaptively updated with the change in the microgrid loading to achieve the desired transient response. The proposed scheme is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem to determine the per-phase unsymmetrical droop settings and UVI that fit different loading states simultaneously. Several case studies are designed to test the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme under different types of disturbances and operating conditions. The cases are conducted on the IEEE 34-bus benchmark power distribution feeder with a combination of unbalanced linear and nonlinear loads. Moreover, the proposed control is validated using real-time simulations carried out in OPAL-RT system. The results show that the proposed control scheme is capable of mitigating voltage quality issues by reducing the voltage unbalance factor and voltage distortion.</description></item><item><title>Design and Tank Testing of Reinforcement Learning Control for Wave Energy Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10592659</link><description>This paper introduces a model-free control strategy utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the electrical power generation of a point absorber wave energy converter (WEC). While model-based methods may suffer from control performance degradation due to modeling errors, such as inherent Coulomb-type friction, RL-based approaches are well-suited for the WEC environment, where system dynamics are complex or unknown. The strength lies in their ability to learn from interactions with the environment, bypassing the necessity for precise models. To enhance the control performance in electrical power generation, a control-oriented loss model is established, and a force penalty term is introduced into the reward function to avoid the WEC system operating in high-loss, low-efficiency regions. To further eliminate the reliance on wave information and improve applicability, an analysis is conducted to examine the contribution of each state feature to the training outcomes and a loss-considering and wave information-independent RL-based control scheme is developed. The RL-based controller is further validated on a point absorber WEC prototype in the wave tank experiment, demonstrating effective implementation and commendable performance in both regular and irregular waves.</description></item><item><title>Towards Improving Unit Commitment Economics: An Add-On Tailor for Renewable Energy and Reserve Predictions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10592660</link><description>Generally, day-ahead unit commitment (UC) is conducted in a predict-then-optimize process: it starts by predicting the renewable energy source (RES) availability and system reserve requirements; given the predictions, the UC model is then optimized to determine the economic operation plans. In fact, predictions within the process are raw. In other words, if the predictions are further tailored to assist UC in making the economic operation plans against realizations of the RES and reserve requirements, UC economics will benefit significantly. To this end, this paper presents a cost-oriented tailor of RES-and-reserve predictions for UC, deployed as an add-on to the predict-then-optimize process. The RES-and-reserve tailor is trained by solving a bi-level mixed-integer programming model: the upper level trains the tailor based on its induced operating cost; the lower level, given tailored predictions, mimics the system operation process and feeds the induced operating cost back to the upper level; finally, the upper level evaluates the training quality according to the fed-back cost. Through this training, the tailor learns to customize the raw predictions into cost-oriented predictions. Moreover, the tailor can be embedded into the existing predict-then-optimize process as an add-on, improving the UC economics. Lastly, the presented method is compared to traditional, binary-relaxing, neural network-based, stochastic, and robust methods.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Controller of a Hybrid Storage System for Power Smoothing With Enlarged Battery Lifetime</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596967</link><description>The volatility of grid-coupled photovoltaics can cause local voltage deviations, while the impact on frequency becomes obvious in isolated weak grids. Thus, a standalone battery is usually proposed for smoothing purposes. However, the frequent cycles and abrupt power variations shrink its life and impair control performance. To this end, this study introduces a controller for a hybrid system composed of a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) and a battery. The proposed method establishes an idling zone for battery to eliminate its short-term activity, while SMES handles any power mismatch. The zone limits are dynamically adjusted in case of power balance detection, while an adaptive saturation is applied to them for maximal SMES utilization and minimal battery degradation. When SMES current deviates from this zone, battery operates with an adaptive ramp rate (i.e., di/dt) depending on the state of charge of SMES, to further optimize its life. Additionally, to prevent unnecessary power circulation among SMES and battery, supervisory control loops are implemented. Finally, to evaluate this scheme against preceding controllers regarding battery life extension, a real-time approach is followed using a dedicated simulator, while a hardware-in-the-loop verification is presented using an actual controller.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability of Synchronous Condenser Co-Located With Renewable Power Plants Under High-Resistance Faults and Risk Mitigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599822</link><description>Synchronous condensers (SynCons) are widely used in supporting the integration of renewable power plants (RPPs) in weak grids. However, recent research suggests that a SynCon co-located with RPPs may be prone to transient rotor angle instability due to the excessive active power injected by nearby RPPs during metallic faults. This paper further discovers that the transient stability of the SynCon may be lost even it generates electrical power during high-resistance faults. This novel mechanism of instability is investigated by deriving power-angle characteristics in different fault scenarios, and then the effect of the system parameters on the stability is analyzed via a proposed index based on the critical clearance time (CCT). It reveals that inappropriate parameters of SynCons, weak grid, and voltage support during fault ride-through (FRT) all contribute to such transient instability. To mitigate such instability, an adaptive FRT strategy is proposed. The electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations based on the PSCAD are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis and the proposed adaptive control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Chance Constrained Optimization Method for Risk-Based Routing and Scheduling of Shared Mobile Energy Storage System With Variable Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599624</link><description>This paper proposes a pricing and scheduling method for shared mobile energy storage systems (SMSs) in coupled power distribution and transportation networks. Different from existing shared energy storage studies, which mostly focus on stationary resources, the paper investigates the SMS operation considering the negotiation of rental prices as well as mobility and charging/discharging among SMS owners and different users. Specifically, the SMS pricing and scheduling with variable renewable energy are established as a bilevel mixed-integer chance-constrained distributionally robust optimization problem. In the upper-level problem, the SMS owner determines pricing and day-ahead mobility strategy to maximize its payoff. In the lower-level problem, the SMS users, i.e., distribution grid operators, determine the SMS charging/discharging power according to the SMS day-ahead pricing results and intra-day distribution grid operation strategies for accommodating variable renewable energy. The distributionally robust chance constraint is designed to cope with the intra-day operational risk caused by the variability of renewable power generation. To cope with the solution difficulty in the proposed bilevel optimization problem, the chance constraint is reformulated as second-order cone constraints, which are further transformed into a set of linear constraints, and then the reformulated bilevel mixed-integer linear programming problem is decomposed and iteratively solved to avoid enumerating lower-level integer variables. Simulation results show that the utilization rate of SMS batteries is increased and the excess renewable power is fully consumed when SMSs are shared among different distribution grids. The proposed distributionally robust optimization achieves higher revenue for the SMS owner and smaller operating costs of distribution grids than robust optimization under uncertain environments.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Indexes for Variable Energy Resource Generation in IEEE Standard 762-2023</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10602780</link><description>IEEE Standard Definitions for Use in Reporting Electric Generating Unit Reliability, Availability, and Productivity has recently been revised to extend the standard to variable energy resource (VER) generating facilities.

Thus, an adjustable robust tri-level defender-attacker-defender (ART-DAD) model is proposed to improve the resilience of power systems by hardening critical transmission lines. The proposed ART-DAD model considers both uncertain attacks and uncertain wind power output, which provides meaningful insights into the resilience improvement of power systems that involve uncertainties. More specifically, the proposed defense model integrates dynamic N-K criterion for attack budgets and the polyhedral uncertainty set for wind power output to develop resilient line hardening strategies. The proposed defense model can be formulated as a mixed integer tri-level programming problem that is decoupled into a master and sub-problem. Then, a constraint-generation based solution algorithm is proposed to solve the overall ART-DAD model with a master and sub-problem scheme. Simulation results on IEEE RTS-79 and RTS-96 systems validate the effectiveness of the proposed resilience improving strategy.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Multi-Mode Single-Step Power Tracking for Microinverter-Based Photovoltaic System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10612237</link><description>The conventional de-load power tracking algorithm, utilizing a perturb and observe method, manifests deficiencies in terms of speed, stability, and efficacy in identifying operating points within the inverter's voltage range.

However, existing data-driven methods cannot be applied to new wind farms due to the lack of operational data. This paper presents a novel Bayesian deep learning-based adaptive wind farm power prediction (BDL-AWFPP) method, which is the first time to utilize the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation results as the prior of BDL-based method, thus avoiding the problem that data-driven approaches cannot be applied to newly constructed wind farms. Firstly, a CFD-based wind farm numerical simulation database and a wind turbine power curve database are established to construct a multi-source heterogeneous prior dataset. Then, the BDL-AWFPP model is proposed to utilize the multi-source heterogeneous prior dataset, which can be updated adaptively with newly acquired operational data and saved periodically throughout the life cycle. And an auxiliary aging assessment method for wind turbines is also developed according to the periodically-saved models. Finally, a stochastic variational inference (SVI)-based parameter updating algorithm is derived for the proposed BDL-AWFPP model. Case studies on an actual wind farm validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Net-Zero Scheduling of Multi-Energy Building Energy Systems: A Learning-Based Robust Optimization Approach With Statistical Guarantees</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620675</link><description>Buildings produce a significant share of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, making homes and businesses a major factor in climate change. To address this critical challenge, this paper explores achieving net-zero emission through the carbon-aware optimal scheduling of the multi-energy building integrated energy systems (BIES). We integrate advanced technologies and strategies, such as the carbon capture system (CCS), power-to-gas (P2G), carbon tracking, and emission allowance trading, into the traditional BIES scheduling problem. The proposed model enables accurate accounting of carbon emissions associated with building energy systems and facilitates the implementation of low-carbon operations. Furthermore, to address the challenge of accurately assessing uncertainty sets related to forecasting errors of loads, generation, and carbon intensity, we develop a learning-based robust optimization approach for BIES that is robust in the presence of uncertainty and guarantees statistical feasibility. The proposed approach comprises a shape learning stage and a shape calibration stage to generate an optimal uncertainty set that ensures favorable results from a statistical perspective. Numerical studies conducted based on both synthetic and real-world datasets have demonstrated that the approach yields up to 8.2% cost reduction, compared with conventional methods, in assisting buildings to robustly reach net-zero emissions.</description></item><item><title>Deriving Sufficient Conditions for Exact Relaxation of Complementarity Constraints in Optimization Problems With Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10629239</link><description>Energy storage is becoming increasingly important in power and energy systems. However, its strongly nonconvex complementarity constraints, which prevent simultaneous charging or discharging behavior, hinder its application in optimization-based decision making. One remedy is to relax these constraints, but the existing relaxation methods are specific to power system applications with limited universality. To bridge this gap, we provide a methodology to derive the general form of sufficient conditions for the exact relaxation of a general energy storage-concerned optimization problem (ESCOP). Specific sufficient conditions for a wide range of ESCOPs can be easily accessed via the proposed methodology. This paper provides mathematical proofs and analyses of the proposed conditions, where sufficient conditions obtained from specific forms of ESCOPs are numerically validated to guarantee exact relaxation and significantly improve the ESCOP solution efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Joint Electricity and Carbon Sharing With PV and Energy Storage: A Low-Carbon DR-Based Game Theoretic Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623777</link><description>This paper proposes a joint electricity and carbon sharing framework with photovoltaic (PV) and energy storage system (ESS) for deep decarbonization, allowing distributed PV prosumers to participate in a sharing network established by aggregator of prosumers (AOP). The ESS-equipped AOP plays multiple roles as a carbon aggregator, an ESS operator, and an energy-sharing provider at the same time. First, a demand response (DR)-based model that incorporates the multi-strategy of ESS is proposed to optimize energy-carbon transaction. A low-carbon DR with consideration of electricity-carbon coupling is developed to incentivize prosumers to adjust consumption behavior for costs and emissions reduction. Second, a joint optimization based on Stackelberg game is proposed, where AOP is leader, and prosumers act as followers. A dynamic pricing mechanism is proposed for AOP to determine the electricity-carbon coupled selling and buying prices simultaneously. Meanwhile, prosumers would adjust their energy consumption as response to different sharing prices. In addition, a distributed optimization algorithm with interactions is used to reach the Stackelberg game equilibrium. Finally, through a practical testing case, the effectiveness of the method is validated in terms of economic benefits and PV sharing enhancement, as well as the reduction of carbon emissions.</description></item><item><title>Cooperative Planning of Multi-Energy System and Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10631701</link><description>Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) can play critical roles in transitioning to global net-zero emissions. However, existing works only focus on small-scale or local CO2 utilization. For the first time, this paper proposes a cooperative planning model of multi-energy system and CCUS considering the regional CO2 availability. In this model, the multi-energy system and CCUS are coupled through interconnected energy hubs. To leverage its inherent operational dispatchability and flexibility, the physicochemical and thermo-electrochemical processes of CCUS are mathematically formulated with source-sink matching analysis. The multi-energy planning is a demanding optimization challenge owing to its inherent nonconvexities and substantial energy-interest couplings. The original problem is firstly relaxed as mixed integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) to ensure satisfactory computational efficiency. A carbon-oriented bargaining problem can then be reformulated to share the cooperative surplus, which is further decomposed into a joint investment/operation subproblem and a cost-sharing subproblem. The proposed methodology is benchmarked over interconnected energy hub systems to show its effectiveness and superiority in technical, economic, and environmental aspects.</description></item><item><title>Semi-Peer-to-Peer Safety Coordination Control for Distributed Battery Energy Storage System in DC Microgrids via Saturated Limitation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10631704</link><description>This paper presents a semi-peer coordination control strategy to ensure the bus voltage stability and effectively constrain the power trajectory, thereby mitigating safety concerns arising from excessive unit power and communication failures in distributed battery energy storage systems (DBESS) based DC microgrids. Firstly, the primary controller is employed a saturated feedforward design to maintain bus voltage stability and address the excessive part of power allocation with droop control. The saturation results enable flexible switching of the reference state, allowing energy storage units (ESUs) to autonomously transition between voltage tracking and power tracking modes. Secondly, the dual-dynamic power allocation strategy is introduced with distributed consensus and saturation allocation.The power allocation with distributed consensus aims to achieve synchronous proportional charging and discharging for SOC balancing. For the offline ESUs of communication failures, saturation power allocation is designed with arrived operation point to avoid the over-utilization of offline ESUs. To address potential communication failures in offline ESUs, the saturation power allocation strategy based on the current operational point is devised to mitigate the risk of over-utilization of offline ESUs. Finally, simulations and experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>An Equitable Active Power Curtailment Framework for Overvoltage Mitigation in PV-Rich Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10636072</link><description>There are various active power curtailment (APC) approaches to mitigate overvoltage. In PV-rich networks, the overvoltage happens to be especially at the end of the distribution feeders. While APC helps maintain voltage within operational limits, it results in varying degrees of renewable curtailment for each prosumer. This curtailment increases as the distance from the transformer grows. Hence, these approaches introduce unfairness among prosumers. This study proposes an equitable APC (EAPC) based on the prosumer's self-consumption rate (SCR). The method calculates each prosumer's SCR, compares it with the precalculated critical SCR, and calculates a fair share of curtailment for each prosumer. Subsequently, leveraging the voltage sensitivity matrix obtained from the inverse of the Jacobian matrix, the new active power injection at the point of common coupling (PCC) is calculated to mitigate the overvoltage. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, a comparison with three other methods is presented under various PV penetration levels. The proposed EAPC is less sensitive to the prosumer's location and improves fairness among prosumers. In addition, a battery deployment scenario is analysed considering the annual supply and demand balance to suppress the extra curtailment introduced by EAPC without increasing the battery capacity.</description></item><item><title>Shape Optimization of a Point Absorber Wave Energy Converter for Reduced Current Drag and Improved Wave Energy Capture Using Neural Networks and Genetic Algorithms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638322</link><description>The shape of the floating buoy of a point absorber wave energy converter (WEC) plays a crucial role in both wave energy harvesting and current drag reduction. In this study, an approach to optimizing the buoy hull geometry with a neural network that replaces the hydrodynamic analysis software is presented, aimed at reducing the ocean current drag force while improving wave energy captured. A new parametric model is introduced to describe the complex shape of the buoy by utilizing the control points of non-uniform rational b-splines. A neural network is developed to significantly reduce the computational time compared to traditional hydrodynamic simulation methods. The optimal hull shape of the buoy is determined by solving an optimization problem using a genetic algorithm, a global optimization technique. The results of the case studies show that the optimal buoy hull shape reduces 68.7% and 71.1% of the current drag, and 50% of mooring line forces compared to the cylinder-shaped buoy and the optimal-power-shaped hull from literature. The optimal buoy hull shape increases the wave energy extraction by 46.1% compared to the thin-ship-shaped buoy but performs 21.1% worse than the optimal-power-shaped hull from the literature.</description></item><item><title>Electric Energy Maximization for Oscillating Water Column Wave Energy Systems Using a Receding-Horizon Pseudospectral Control Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10636763</link><description>Among the various wave energy technologies, oscillating water columns (OWCs) have shown some of the greatest promise, due to their simplicity of operation and possibility for shore mounting, with consequent ease of access and integration with other infrastructure, such as breakwaters. To minimize the levelized cost of energy, OWC energy capture must be maximized. To date, most focus has been on maximizing air turbine efficiency, while neglecting other aspects of the system. This paper presents an integrated wave-to-wire optimal control approach, considering the OWC hydrodynamics, turbine characteristics, and generator. The approach is based on a receding-horizon pseudospectral formulation, which transcribes the continuous-time optimal control problem into a finite-dimensional nonlinear program. The results show optimal exploitation of the hydrodynamic, aerodynamic, and electric subsystem efficiency characteristics, surpassing the electric energy production available through a specific focus on turbine efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Comparative Evaluation of Converter Control Impact on Torsional Dynamics of Type-IV Grid-Forming Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637722</link><description>This paper explores the impact of back-to-back converter control strategies on the torsional dynamics of grid-forming permanent magnet synchronous generator wind turbines (GFM-WTs). Two general converter control methods for GFM-WTs, distinguished by the placement of dc-link voltage control (DVC)&#8211;either in the machine-side converter or the grid-side converter, are evaluated through the complex torque coefficient method to offer a theoretical basis. It reveals that a negative damping is introduced when the DVC is with the machine-side converter. Then, to further characterize the parametric impacts of electrical and mechanical system constants and controller gains, the sensitivity analysis is performed by employing the partial derivative algorithm, which is based on the feedforward neural network training. It is found that the converter control has a limited impact on the damped frequency in both GFM converter control methods. Finally, electromagnetic simulations based on full-order nonlinear models of GFM-WTs are carried out to confirm the theoretical findings.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Transfer Learning Framework for Data-Scarce HVAC Power Consumption Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637762</link><description>Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems constitute a large proportion of building energy consumption and provide considerable potential for power grid regulation. While the HVAC power consumption forecasting task is generally straightforward with sufficient historical data, it becomes challenging when dealing with scarce data. Such situation is common in cases of intermittent data collection or early system implementations, where precise forecasting is required despite limited data available. Considering accessible datasets from nearby or similar HVAC systems through energy management systems, this paper proposes an adaptive transfer learning framework to tackle this issue. Specifically, the framework leverages diverse source domains, employing model-level regularizers to quantify domain discrepancies and an adaptive parameter regulation mechanism to dynamically align source domains with the target domain. Embedded within the framework, a unique deep learning architecture with attention mechanisms is proposed, capable of identifying complex temporal patterns and hierarchical features in HVAC systems. Experiments on public HVAC datasets demonstrate the generalization, accuracy and robustness of our methodology under diverse data-scarce scenarios.</description></item><item><title>A Novel GAN Architecture Reconstructed Using Bi-LSTM and Style Transfer for PV Temporal Dynamics Simulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10601515</link><description>The stochastic production simulation of photovoltaic (PV) power is crucial for the analysis of power balance in power planning, annual or monthly operational planning, and long-term transactions in the electricity market, especially in power systems with a high share of PVs.

Uncontrolled state changes can occur if optimal microgrid restoration and dispatch algorithms, used for generating control commands for distributed energy resources, do not incorporate the behavior of automatic controllers of voltage regulation devices. Inaccurate demand forecasts may be encountered since post-outage demand of behind-the-meter net metered (NM) loads can vary significantly from their historical NM profiles. This paper proposes an optimization formulation which allows optimal control of voltage regulators and capacitor banks without remote control and communication capabilities. A generalized demand model for NM loads is proposed which incorporates the cold load pickup phenomenon and their time varying post-outage demand in accordance with the IEEE 1547 standard. The time dependent optimal control formulation and the NM demand model are integrated in a sequential microgrid restoration algorithm by linearization of the involved logic propositions. A detailed case study on the unbalanced IEEE 123-node test system in OpenDSS validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Data-Driven Frequency Control in Networked Microgrids via Voltage Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10511276</link><description>In this paper, a distributed data-driven frequency control scheme is proposed for the off-grid networked microgrid system (NMG). In the proposed scheme, the frequency is regulated by coordinately adjusting the active power generation provided by controllable generators and the active power demand provided by voltage sensitive loads, where the active power consumption of voltage sensitive loads is specially modified by adjusting the load operating voltages via voltage regulation. The whole control problem is solved with the feedback-based gradient method. To achieve better scalability and privacy, the overall control scheme is implemented in a distributed manner by employing an approximated gradient that can be calculated by limited communication between neighboring MGs. To further enable the controller to adapt to real-time system conditions, the required system model is updated online via the partial least square method in a recursive manner, which renders the proposed controller model-free. Numerical simulations involving detailed nonlinear NMG models illustrate the key benefits of the proposed method, including (i) eliminating the need for an accurate offline system model, (ii) reducing the need of controllable generation, and (iii) being robust against communication delays.</description></item><item><title>A New Composite Control Strategy for Large-Signal Stabilization of Constant Power Loads in Islanded AC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10518170</link><description>Large operating range in an islanded AC microgrid feeding constant power loads (CPLs) will cause both the severe amplitude wave and harmonic distortion of the bus voltage. This paper proposes a new composite control strategy to realize the large-signal stabilization for an islanded AC microgrid feeding CPLs. Firstly, a three-phase inverter system feeding CPLs is constructed in a dq rotating coordinate form. Secondly, the nonlinear disturbance observer technique is introduced to accurately and simultaneously estimate the current of the CPLs and coupling interactions, serving as feed-forward compensations for the AC bus voltage controller. Then a composite strategy can be designed by executing a feedback domination procedure. For the issue of voltage regulation under the large variation of CPLs and control targets, the proposed control strategy exhibits three merits: large-signal stability, fast performance recovery ability and concise control form. The tuning process of the control parameters are illustrated in the simulation. The effectiveness and priority of the proposed strategy are demonstrated by abundant of hardware-in-loop (HIL) and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Weighted Gradient Descent Method With Adaptive Step Sizes for Energy Management of Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10530408</link><description>Economic dispatch problems for power systems become more challenging as the system sizes, types and data increase significantly. Facing these complex optimization problems, centralized optimization methods may fall short and appear inefficient. Conversely, distributed optimization methods seem to be a potential and powerful tool for dealing with these more complex problems. However, some widely-used distributed methods suffer from their low convergence rates. Therefore, in this paper, a faster distributed optimization method via gradient descent is proposed, where the weighted matrix and adaptive step sizes are the keys of our method. In the distributed gradient method, the weighted matrix is modified and constructed from the out-degrees and upper limits of the second derivatives of objective functions, which boosts gradients reaching consensus more quickly. Further, the adaptive step sizes are presented to overcome the low convergence rate caused by manual settings of step sizes, where the Hessian matrix are used iteratively to obtain the optimal step sizes, which cooperates with the weighted matrix for gradients to lead to a faster convergence rate. Next, two propositions and a theorem are proved to show the linear convergence feature of the proposed method, which guarantees the fast convergence of our method. Finally, the proposed method is applied to solve the economic dispatch problem that consists of economic and environmental objectives in microgrids. Simulation results show that the number of iterations of our method is only one third or even less than those of some widely used methods. Moreover, when solving economic dispatch problems, our method exhibits superior fault tolerance in comparison to centralized methods.</description></item><item><title>Fault Analysis and Voltage Support Strategy Through Equivalent Line Impedances for MMCs in AC/DC Hybrid Distribution Networks Under Asymmetrical Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10485271</link><description>Under asymmetrical fault, modular multilevel converters (MMCs) in AC/DC hybrid distribution network should limit fault currents and inject currents to support grid voltages. The effect of voltage support is related to the line impedances, hence, injecting active-reactive currents based on line impedance parameters is a valuable solution. However, there are some problems remained to be solved: 1) fault network is quite different with the pre-fault network, and equivalent model of fault network should be built accurately; 2) the optimal ratio of injected active-reactive currents  $(I_{\mathrm{d}} / I_{\mathrm{q}}$ ) based on the line impedances in equivalent model should be deduced; 3) impedance parameters in the model should be estimated. Thus, in this manuscript, fault analysis is described via symmetrical component method, and MMC-based interconnected sequence network (ISN) is proposed to illustrated the fault network with fault branch under the steady-state period of fault. Then voltage support strategy based on the equivalent line impedances of ISN model are put forward. Perturbation and observation algorithm is introduced to estimate these impedances. Finally, the proposed ISN model and the voltage support strategy are verified in MATLAB/Simulink.</description></item><item><title>Post-Disaster Robust Restoration Scheme for Distribution Network Considering Rerouting Process of Cyber System With 5G</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10492470</link><description>Due to global warming, the frequency of various extreme weather events is increasing worldwide, posing significant threats to the power system. As a substantial number of distributed energy resources (DERs) and other smart devices are integrated into the distribution system, traditional passive distribution systems are transforming into cyber-physical active distribution systems. Components in both the cyber network and the physical network may sustain damage following severe natural disasters. Therefore, this paper proposes a post-disaster restoration scheme for active distribution networks (ADNs) considering the coupling of cyber-physical systems. The innovation of this work lies in the full utilization of 5G networks, complemented by a novel rerouting process, which reconnects offline cyber devices after disasters. This approach substantially enhances the resilience of the cyber system, which in turn can effectively support the restoration process of the physical system. Furthermore, the uncertainty of DERs and the three-phase unbalanced characteristic of ADNs are taken into account. To reduce the computation complexity, linearization techniques are applied to nonlinear constraints, ultimately resulting in a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation based on a two-stage robust optimization model, which is solved by the column and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) algorithm. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model are verified on both a modified IEEE 33-node system and a modified IEEE 123-node system integrated with cyber networks.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Single-Ended Transient-Based Boundary Protection Scheme for 35 kV Active Distribution Networks Based on Capacitive Voltage Transformers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504853</link><description>When many distributed generators (DGs) are connected to active distribution networks (ADNs), the performance of conventional overcurrent protection can seriously deteriorate. In response, single-ended transient-based boundary protection is considered an effective scheme for improving relay performance in ADNs due to its independence from power supply properties and its ability to cover an entire protected feeder. However, this approach depends on the filtering effect of the line boundary. This paper finds that capacitive voltage transformers (CVTs), metal-oxide arresters (MOAs), and the stray capacitances of the other apparatuses can serve together as line boundaries at substations and switching stations, and their excellent high-frequency filtering characteristics can assist in boundary protection design. A protection criterion is constructed based on the differences in high-frequency spectral energy between the internal and external fault-generated traveling waves (TWs). Furthermore, a novel two-stage boundary protection scheme is formed by reasonably coordinating the operation sequence and the protection scope of the first- and second-stage boundary protection. Finally, based on the PSCAD platform, the effectiveness, sensitivity, and reliability of the proposed protection scheme are verified under different fault scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Dispatch for Integrated Energy System Considering Data-Driven Dynamic Energy Hubs and Thermal Dynamics of Pipeline Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10485199</link><description>The modeling of dynamics in energy devices and pipeline networks reflects the real states of multi-energy flows, which is significant for realizing accurate optimal dispatch of integrated energy system (IES). In this paper, an approach with data-driven dynamic energy hubs (DDEH) and thermal dynamics of pipeline networks (TDPN) is proposed to describe the energy dynamic response process of IES. Based on the efficiency characteristics of energy conversion and storage devices, data-driven deep neural network (DNN) is adopted to excavate input-output relationship of the variable efficiency devices, which helps establish DDEH in time domain. To address the problem of nonlinear introduced by DNN, the nonlinear activation function in DDEH is equivalently converted into mixed integer linear model. At the same time, the TDPN is developed by bilateral characteristic line method (BCLM), which quantifies the time delay and loss of pipeline networks. TDNP demonstrates the network transportation dynamics in optimal dispatch, and the virtual energy storage effect of pipeline networks are analyzed. Case study from a community IES verifies the proposed approach effectively improve dynamic modeling accuracy of devices and pipeline networks, and have superiority in providing precise, reasonable and highly efficient optimal dispatch scheme.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Combined Heat and Power Dispatch Based on Information Masking Mechanism: A Decentralized Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504614</link><description>Combined heat and power dispatch (CHPD) has aroused widespread attention nowadays due to its great potentiality and cost-effectiveness for wind accommodation. However, the CHPD requires the joint operation of multiple energy agents, and the traditional dispatch scheme is inapplicable in engineering practice due to the demand for privacy preservation among energy agents. To tackle this issue, a privacy-preserving method based on the information masking (IM) mechanism is proposed, which converts the original CHPD problem into another masked CHPD problem by obscuring the privacy parameters of the electric power systems and district heating systems. Furthermore, considering the absence of a third party in practice, we develop an improved IM mechanism based on blockchain, enabling privacy preservation in a fully decentralized framework. Numerical simulations conducted across different cases testify the effectiveness of the proposed privacy-preserving method and tests based on an actual system in Jilin province demonstrate the feasibility of application in practice. The computational performance of the proposed method is validated as well.</description></item><item><title>Load Data Valuation in Multi-Energy Systems: An End-to-End Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508249</link><description>Accurate load forecasting serves as the foundation for the flexible operation of multi-energy systems (MES). Multi-energy loads are tightly coupled and exhibit significant uncertainties. Many works focus on enhancing forecasting accuracy by leveraging cross-sector information. However, data owners may not be motivated to share their data unless it leads to substantial benefits. Ensuring a reasonable data valuation can encourage them to share their data willingly. This paper presents an end-to-end framework to quantify multi-energy load data value by integrating forecasting and decision processes. To address optimization problems with integer variables, a two-stage end-to-end model solution is proposed. Moreover, a profit allocation strategy based on contribution to cost savings is investigated to encourage data sharing in MES. The experimental results demonstrate a significant decrease in operation costs, suggesting that the proposed valuation approach more effectively extracts the inherent data value than traditional methods. According to the proposed incentive mechanism, all sectors can benefit from data sharing by improving forecasting accuracy or receiving economic compensation.</description></item><item><title>Two-Step Diffusion Policy Deep Reinforcement Learning Method for Low-Carbon Multi-Energy Microgrid Energy Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10529228</link><description>Coordinately scheduling multi-energy in a power system has attracted great research attention because of the benefits like improved energy utilization efficiency, lower system cost and carbon emission. However, the uncertainties from renewable power generation, energy supply and demand sides make this task highly complex. To solve it, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with a novel diffusion model-based policy is proposed to optimize the problem of energy management in a multi-energy microgrid (MEMG) system. Moreover, a two-step reward function is developed to improve the training performance. To lower the overall carbon footprint and economic costs, the carbon emission trading and green certificate trading market mechanisms are introduced in our system to guide the end-user&#8217;s energy behaviors. A piece-wise linear carbon price model is proposed to constrain the undesired behavior more strictly and further reduce carbon emissions. The superior performance of the proposed scheduling method is compared with several benchmark methods, i.e., three state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, based on real-world datasets. Numerous case studies including three IEEE standard test systems have illustrated its effectiveness in terms of carbon reduction and cost efficiency, acquiring better convergence speed and stability at the same time, all of which lead our method to a better energy management strategy.</description></item><item><title>Online Operation Optimization for Hydrogen-Based Building Energy Systems Under Uncertainties</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10529226</link><description>Hydrogen-based energy systems have attracted widespread attention due to their capabilities of promoting renewable penetration and cutting carbon emissions. In this article, we study an operation optimization problem of a hydrogen-based building energy system. Since there are multi-source uncertainties related to electricity price, hydrogen price, electrical load, thermal load, and renewable generation output, spatially and temporally coupled constraints associated with power balance, heat balance, and energy storage systems, and nonlinear constraints, it is difficult to solve the considered optimization problem. To deal with the above difficulties, this paper proposes a low-complexity online operation optimization algorithm. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the algorithmic feasibility and performance guarantees. Extensive simulations verify that the proposed algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance and reduce operation cost by 2.81%-7.74% compared with five baselines, including model predictive control and deep reinforcement learning.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Agent Deep Constrained Q-Learning Method for Smart Building Energy Management Under Uncertainties</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10496495</link><description>Data-driven energy management with flexible appliances in smart buildings is a key towards power system operational intelligence. However, the low efficiency of existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods in terms of optimization and computational performance, caused by reward shaping, large neural networks, system-wide constraints and reward allocation of photovoltaic power generation, signifies the need for new system-specific DRL methods. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep constrained Q-learning method to obtain online optimal solutions for smart building energy management in presence of various uncertainties. The proposed method minimizes daily energy cost via real-time adjustment of flexible appliances, and addressing impacts of the uncertainties. A deep constrained Q-learning algorithm is developed to effectively avoid reward shaping. By adopting multi-layer perception to estimate thermodynamics and electric vehicle charging states, and developing appliance-specific logic, it is novel to calculate the joint safe action space of all appliances during the training process. A multi-agent approach is developed to address the system-wide constraints and the reward allocation, directly in the Q-update, where hyper-parameters of individual agents are tuned separately. Numerical simulation results verify the high efficiency of the proposed method in daily energy cost minimization and online energy management.</description></item><item><title>Under-Frequency Load Shedding for Power Reserve Management in Islanded Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508572</link><description>This paper introduces under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) schemes specially designed to fulfill the power reserve requirements in islanded microgrids (MGs), where only one grid-forming resource is available for frequency regulation. When the power consumption of the MG exceeds a pre-defined threshold, the MG frequency will be lowered to various setpoints, thereby triggering UFLS for different levels of load reduction. Three types of controllable devices are considered for executing UFLS: sectionalizers, smart meters, and controllable appliances. To avoid unnecessary UFLS activation, various time delay settings are analyzed, allowing short-lived power spikes caused by events like motor startups or cold-load pickups to be disregarded. We tested the proposed UFLS schemes on a modified IEEE 123-bus system on the OPAL-RT eMEGASIM platform. Simulation results verify the efficacy of the proposed approaches in restoring power reserves, maintaining phase power balance, and effectively handling short-lived power fluctuations. Furthermore, in comparison to sectionalizer-based UFLS, using smart meters or controllable loads for UFLS allows for a more accurate per-phase load shedding in a progressive manner. As a result, it leads to better balanced three-phase voltage and serves more loads.</description></item><item><title>Pareto-Optimized Thermal Control of Multi-Zone Buildings Using Limited Sensor Measurements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10530220</link><description>This paper presents a control-oriented building thermal model and optimization framework. Space heating is used as an illustrative example of a flexible building load, with temperature setpoints as a control input. The presented framework is applicable to practical building systems where measurements are limited by cost and installation burden. An Unscented Kalman Filter estimates parameters and disturbance inputs of a multi-zone thermal circuit. Forecast models of multiple exogenous input sources are created from disturbance proxies and estimated disturbance inputs. Zone-level controllers in the thermal circuit simulation estimate the heating system response based on forecasted exogenous thermal inputs and proposed temperature setpoint profiles. Genetic algorithm-based operations are used to find an approximate Pareto set, i.e., the best trade-offs in the objective space. The focus of this work is reducing energy usage from space heating, while maintaining or improving thermal comfort. The full framework is demonstrated using data collected from a university building. Results predict that the proposed method provides a lower energy consumption than the baseline strategy. The framework is implemented in practice in a model predictive control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Flexible Building Energy Management With Neural ODEs-Based Model Predictive Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531060</link><description>The increasing renewable penetration leads to a great need for flexible resources to balance supply and demand. Building energy systems can provide considerable flexibility by optimally coordinating various appliances. However, the complex thermodynamics and insufficient data associated challenge the modeling and operation of building energy systems. To address this, this paper proposes a neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) based model predictive control (MPC) framework for building energy management. Flexibilities are explored from two aspects: building thermal capacity and energy equipment coordination. The former is modeled using neural ODEs due to its complexity, while the latter is modeled as an energy hub. Both models are integrated into MPC in a linear form. The neural ODEs model is designed to strike a balance between reliability and representational capability, as well as a balance between the accuracy of long- and short-term predictions. The proposed method is verified on a simulated multizone retail building. The results indicate that the proposed model has a higher accuracy than the traditional resistance&#8212;capacitance (RC) model and the neural network model in operation with efficient computational performance. The controlled building can respond to price signals while providing demand response resources, which may result in significant cost savings.</description></item><item><title>Online Learning for Robust Voltage Control Under Uncertain Grid Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10486962</link><description>Voltage control generally requires accurate information about the grid&#8217;s topology in order to guarantee network stability. However, accurate topology identification is challenging for existing methods, especially as the grid is subject to increasingly frequent reconfiguration due to the adoption of renewable energy. In this work, we combine a nested convex body chasing algorithm with a robust predictive controller to achieve provably finite-time convergence to safe voltage limits in the online setting where there is uncertainty in both the network topology as well as load and generation variations. In an online fashion, our algorithm narrows down the set of possible grid models that are consistent with observations and adjusts reactive power generation accordingly to keep voltages within desired safety limits. Our approach can also incorporate existing partial knowledge of the network to improve voltage control performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a case study on a Southern California Edison 56-bus distribution system. Our experiments show that in practical settings, the controller is indeed able to narrow the set of consistent topologies quickly enough to make control decisions that ensure stability in both linearized and realistic non-linear models of the distribution grid.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Two-Timescale Configuration of Mobile Edge Computing With Mixed Energy Supply</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504784</link><description>Powering mobile edge computing (MEC) with a hybrid supply of smart grid (SG) and renewable energy source (RES) offers an opportunity to utilize clean energy and cut down energy expenses under two-way energy transactions. We propose two-timescale online resource allocation and energy management (TSRE) for MEC with a hybrid power supply, adapting to dynamic task and RES arrivals, wireless channels, and energy prices. The TSRE minimizes the time-averaged cost of predictive energy planning and real-time energy trading of base stations (BSs), and the energy usage of mobile users. By generalizing the Lyapunov optimization and stochastic subgradient method, the energy planning (sub)problem is solved upon RES arrivals using only historical data. The real-time offloading schedules, energy trading decisions and CPU configurations are decoupled over time and (asymptotically) optimally made in a distributed manner. The feasibility and the asymptotic optimality of the TSRE are proved. Numerical results demonstrate that the TSRE saves system cost significantly by 33.7%, compared to its baselines.</description></item><item><title>Revenue Maximization for a Battery Storage With Optimal Capacity Revamping Due to Cyclic Fade</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10506242</link><description>An accurate approach for optimal revenue-stacking operation of battery storage assets should consider the degradation of their energy capacity as a result of cyclic charging/discharging operations.

However, scheduling massive HVACs is challenging due to computation complexity and the uncertainty of outdoor temperature. In this paper, we first introduce a novel continuous-time (CT) aggregation model to reveal the potential intra-hour flexibility of HVACs. For accurate aggregation, a new affine transformation is designed to handle the heterogeneity in high-dimensional feasible region. Further, for reliable aggregation in practical environment, the outdoor temperature uncertainty is constructed by distributionally robust chance constrains and integrated into the aggregation model. Secondly, for the tractable calculation of the proposed CT aggregation model, a cascade of tailored reformulation techniques is proposed, including the Bernstein polynomial spline, polytope projection, and linearization transformation. Thirdly, a customized hierarchical dispatch framework is proposed via incorporating the proposed CT aggregation model into reserve provision in power system dispatch, so as to efficiently schedule massive HVACs to cope with the renewable uncertainty. Case studies verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed CT aggregation model in aggregation accuracy, intra-hour flexibility utilization, and uncertainty handling.</description></item><item><title>Load Recognition With Few-Shot Transfer Learning Based on Meta-Learning and Relational Network in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504869</link><description>Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) monitors the operating status and power consumption of residential appliances with only one main meter, providing a new measure for energy management. Deep learning (DL) shows outperformance in NILM. However, the lack of appliance data caused by rapid growth appliance types and high-cost data sampling reduces the DL-based load recognition accuracy. Transfer learning (TL) enables DL-based model generalization. However, the generalization would be limited when data in the target domain are insufficient. Therefore, a non-intrusive load recognizing (NILR) few-shot TL based on meta-learning and relational network is proposed to improve the load recognition generalization performance, named MRNILR-TL. First, the method constructs an episode task dataset by task sampling to provide diverse learnable tasks for few-shot load recognition training. Afterward, a multi-classification load recognition model based on meta-learning and relational network is constructed, and a meta-learning based relational network enhances the ability to learn the laws of similarity among appliance features from few-shot data. Finally, achieving the few-shot multi-classification load recognition generalization by directly transferring the source task knowledge and strategies to the target task. Experimental results in four transfer scenes demonstrate the proposed method achieves generalization and outperforms most existing NILM TL methods.</description></item><item><title>A Distributionally Robust Model Predictive Control for Static and Dynamic Uncertainties in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10486942</link><description>The integration of various power sources, including renewables and electric vehicles, into smart grids is expanding, introducing uncertainties that can result in issues like voltage imbalances, load fluctuations, and power losses. These challenges negatively impact the reliability and stability of online scheduling in smart grids. Existing research often addresses uncertainties affecting current states but overlooks those that impact future states, such as the unpredictable charging patterns of electric vehicles. To distinguish between these, we term them static uncertainties and dynamic uncertainties, respectively. This paper introduces WDR-MPC, a novel approach that stands for two-stage Wasserstein-based Distributionally Robust (WDR) optimization within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, aimed at effectively managing both types of uncertainties in smart grids. The dynamic uncertainties are first reformulated into ambiguity tubes and then the distributionally robust bounds of both dynamic and static uncertainties can be established using WDR optimization. By employing ambiguity tubes and WDR optimization, the stochastic MPC system is converted into a nominal one. Moreover, we develop a convex reformulation method to speed up WDR computation during the two-stage optimization. The distinctive contribution of this paper lies in its holistic approach to both static and dynamic uncertainties in smart grids. Comprehensive experiment results on IEEE 38-bus and 94-bus systems reveal the method&#8217;s superior performance and the potential to enhance grid stability and reliability.</description></item><item><title>A Reliable Evaluation Metric for Electrical Load Forecasts in V2G Scheduling Considering Statistical Features of EV Charging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508231</link><description>An accurate electrical load forecast is essential for the effective implementation of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology to achieve optimal electric vehicle (EV) charging decisions, consequently, ensuring the security and stability of power grid. While prevailing evaluation metrics prioritize forecast quality, they often overlook the significant influence a forecast exerts when integrated into the V2G scheduling optimization. In this paper, a reliable metric is proposed for forecasts in the context of V2G scheduling from the perspective of forecast value. Firstly, we conducted meticulously designed experiments to expose the limitations of forecast quality metrics in the context of V2G scheduling, as well as reveal three key findings. Subsequently, to address computational challenges and enhance representativeness of scheduling results, statistical features of EV charging are used to construct the aggregate model of EV fleet. Then, a reliable metric called V2G scheduling value error (V2G-SVE) is proposed to evaluate the degradation rate of scheduling performance as the score for forecasting performance. Finally, extensive case studies provide compelling evidence for the effectiveness and broad applicability of V2G-SVE. Beyond proposing an evaluation metric, this paper also aims to provide valuable insights about potential direction of improvement for future load forecasting technology.</description></item><item><title>Factoring Electrochemical and Full-Lifecycle Aging Modes of Battery Participating in Energy and Transportation Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10533267</link><description>As the world transitions towards sustainable alternatives, transportation electrification emerges as a pivotal strategy within deep decarbonization initiatives undertaken by governments globally.

However, a key challenge often overlooked is the impact of battery aging on the economy and longevity of electric vehicles (EVs). The pressing need to understand and mitigate the costs and implications of battery aging forms the crux of this research. This paper aims to improve the lifecycle economy of EVs participating in energy and transportation systems by factoring in the electrochemical aging modes of the battery. In the first stage, battery electrochemical aging features are modeled by learning cell fading rate under different healthy states from the Stanford experimental dataset. Then, by comprehensively quantifying the impact of depth of discharge, C-rate, state of health, and state of charge, this paper establishes a full lifecycle degradation model to model battery aging under different working conditions and aging stages. In the second stage, battery electrochemical aging features are further integrated into vehicle energy management to realize the effective utilization of BESS in energy and transportation systems. With the proposed energy management scheme, vehicle batteries with different electrochemical aging stages can be flexibly utilized under full lifecycles. The effectiveness of the proposed methodologies is verified under the cases of EVs participating in energy and transportation systems. Results in this paper validate the necessity of factoring battery electrochemical aging features in BESS management and provide a new perspective for further improving the total economy of transportation electrification.</description></item><item><title>AdaptEdge: Targeted Universal Adversarial Attacks on Time Series Data in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10488456</link><description>Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a key technique in smart grid operations for task classification of power quality disturbances (PQDs) nomenclature PQDsPower Quality Disturbances. Even though these models have considerably improved the efficiency of power infrastructure, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks presents potential difficulties. For the first time, we introduce a novel algorithm called Adaptive Edge (AdaptEdge), nomenclature AdaptEdgeAdaptive Edge which effectively employs targeted universal adversarial attack to deceive DL models working with time series data. The unique contribution of this algorithm is its ability to maintain a delicate balance between the fooling rate and the imperceptibility of perturbations to human observers.

We implemented our algorithm across various advanced DL models and found considerable efficacy, demonstrating its adaptability and versatility across diverse architectures. The results of our study highlight the pressing need for developing more robust DL model implementations in the context of the smart grid.

To maintain the security of power systems, it is critical to develop efficient locational detectors for FDIAs. However, designing FDIA detectors that could model the inherent underlying graph structures of smart grids and spatially correlated measurement data residing on both branches and buses such that FDIAs in the edge space could be detected and located, remains an open problem. In this work, we propose an alternative graph representation for smart grids, regarding both the power flows on branches and power injections on buses, such that we could simultaneously process these data in the edge space. We propose a Hodge Aggregation Graph Neural Network (AGNN)-based FDIA detector, leveraging the Hodge theory and exploiting the Hodge Laplacian into the AGNN. We further develop a Hodge Aggregation Graph Attention Network (AGAT)-based FDIA detector to enhance the locational detection performance of the Hodge AGNN-based detector, by utilizing the graph attention mechanism. Illustrative simulation results demonstrate the superior locational detection performance of the proposed detectors, compared to the other state-of-the-art FDIA detectors.</description></item><item><title>Homomorphic Encryption-Based Resilient Distributed Energy Management Under Cyber-Attack of Micro-Grid With Event-Triggered Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504611</link><description>Privacy disclosures and malevolent data intrusions targeting adversarial agents pose significant menaces to cyber-physical systems, a reality that extends to the intricate realm of micro-grid energy management.

Even though various defending methods have been studied, it is still challenging to mitigate the damaging impact of LR attacks. In this paper, we propose a phase shifting transformers (PST) based mitigation method utilizing the widely deployed PST devices in optimal power flow (OPF), which can further improve the performance of existing mitigation methods. Specifically, a tri-level optimization is formulated and solved by the column and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) decomposition method in the PST-based mitigation method, which gives the optimal set of PSTs for phase angle adjustment. Since a large amount of binary variables are introduced in the C&amp;amp;CG method, an approximate solution method of the tri-level optimization is presented to reduce computing burden without significantly affecting the optimality in large power systems. Simulations in the PJM 5-bus, IEEE 14-bus, IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems verify the effectiveness and applicability of the PST-based mitigation method.</description></item><item><title>Experimental Cybersecurity Evaluation of Distributed Solar Inverters: Vulnerabilities and Impacts on the Australian Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508264</link><description>The increasing adoption of solar power globally presents an environmentally sustainable alternative to traditional energy sources. However, integrating solar distributed generation (DG) systems into the power grid introduces complexities that can impact the grid&#8217;s reliability and security. While information and communication technologies have significantly improved the management and control of solar DG systems, they concurrently introduce new cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This study explores the security and stability challenges introduced by solar DG systems, with a specific focus on the vulnerabilities in commercial solar inverters. Additionally, it assesses the operational and economic consequences of cybersecurity incidents directed at commercial solar inverters within the energy sector, with a particular emphasis on the Australian grid.

LFC utilizes communication channels to generate control signals, thus it is potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks and faults. This work considers a cyber-physical model for LFC in which the adversary compromises the resources of the cyber layer to inject a stealthy false data injection attack (FDIA) vector. The FDIA injects the best-effort stealthy error into the data collected by the LFC, corrupting the control center&#8217;s calculations and leading to incorrect control signals. To effectively manage this complex decision-making scenario, a game theory-based framework is established to analyze the interaction between the controller and the attacker. Based on the model, an FDIA defense mechanism based on a bi-level differential game is proposed. The experiments conducted on a three-region interconnected power system based on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that the proposed strategy can effectively maintain the stability of the frequency and inter-regional power deviation within acceptable limits, even in the presence of FDIAs.</description></item><item><title>Transferability-Oriented Adversarial Robust Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521912</link><description>Security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) aims to achieve an economical operation while considering the security issues during contingencies. Data-driven security assessment methods can provide security constraints for SCOPF and have been widely developed in the smart grid community to deal with the challenges arising from the increased penetration of renewable energy resources and the deployment of power electronic devices. Nevertheless, it has been recognized that the machine learning model is vulnerable to adversarial examples, and the power system communication network is prone to cyber attacks, which affects the decision-making of security assessment and SCOPF. To this end, a transferability-oriented adversarial robust security-constrained optimal power flow (TOAR-SCOPF) is proposed to diminish the potential security risks from attacks, formulated as an attacker-defender problem. To alleviate the conservatism of TOAR-SCOPF, a more realistic scenario with unknown features and unknown selected machine learning models is considered in this work by developing a novel transferability-oriented adversarial attack (TOA) method for data-driven security assessment while considering the power system&#8217;s physical constraints to bypass the bad data detection mechanism. Case studies are conducted based on the IEEE 39-bus and IEEE 68-bus systems, respectively, to explore the vulnerability and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOAR-SCOPF.</description></item><item><title>Voltage Calculations in Secondary Distribution Networks via Physics-Inspired Neural Network Using Smart Meter Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10517953</link><description>The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) leads to voltage issues across distribution networks, necessitating voltage calculations by utilities. Electric model-free voltage calculation offers an enticing solution. However, most researches mainly focus on primary distribution networks ignoring secondary distribution networks and commonly overlook extreme voltage case calculations, which require the model&#8217;s extrapolation abilities. In addressing the gaps, this paper presents a customized physics-inspired neural network (PINN) model, the structure of which is inspired by the derived coupled power flow model of primary-secondary distribution networks. To ensure precision and rapid convergence, a crafted training framework for the PINN model is proposed. The PINN&#8217;s &#8220;structure-mimetic&#8221; design enables superior extrapolation for unseen scenarios and enhances physical information awareness. We demonstrate this through two applications: hosting capacity analysis and customer-transformer connectivity. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed PINN model are validated on two public testing systems and one utility distribution feeder model.</description></item><item><title>Modularized Bilinear Koopman Operator for Modeling and Predicting Transients of Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10527356</link><description>Modularized Koopman bilinear form (M-KBF) is presented to model and predict the transient dynamics of microgrids in the presence of disturbances. As a scalable data-driven approach, M-KBF divides the identification and prediction of the high-dimensional nonlinear system into the individual study of subsystems, and thus, alleviates the difficulty of intensively handling high volume data and overcomes the curse of dimensionality. For each subsystem, Koopman bilinear form is established to efficiently identify its model by identifying isotypic eigenfunctions via the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) method with an eigenvalue-based order truncation. Extensive tests show that M-KBF can provide accurate transient dynamics prediction for the nonlinear microgrids and verify the plug-and-play modeling and prediction function, which offers a potent tool for identifying high-dimensional systems with reconfiguration feature. The modularity feature of M-KBF enables the provision of fast and precise prediction for the power grid operation and control, paving the way towards online applications.</description></item><item><title>A Generic Transient-Performance-Improved Framework for Privacy-Preserving Distributed Microgrid Controls</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10539270</link><description>Existing studies about the privacy-preserving distributed (PP-Di) controls of islanded AC microgrid (MG) rely on adding the decaying disturbance into communications, such as correlated decaying noise and exponentially decaying disturbance.

Facing the 6G era, the next generation smart grid (NGSG) will be constructed with the assistance of a unified space-ground network. This accounts for the unified network&#8217;s attributions of wide coverage, large base of sources and loads, and the complex environment.

In RIS-assisted wireless communication systems, practical channel measurements and modeling serve as the foundation for system design, network optimization, and performance evaluation. In this paper, a RIS time-domain channel measurement system, based on a software defined radio platform, is developed for the first time to investigate the small-scale fading characteristics of RIS-assisted channels. We present RIS channel measurements in corridor and laboratory scenarios and compare the power delay profile of the channel without RIS, with RIS specular reflection, and with RIS intelligent reflection. The multipath component parameters and cluster parameters based on the Saleh-Valenzuela model are extracted. We find that the power delay profiles (PDPs) of the RIS-assisted channel fit the power-law decay model better than the common exponential decay model and approximate the law of square decay. Through intelligent reflection, the RIS can decrease the delay and concentrate the energy of the virtual line-of-sight (VLoS) path, thereby reducing the delay spread and mitigating multipath fading. Furthermore, the cluster characteristics of RIS-assisted channels are highly dependent on the measurement environment. In the laboratory scenario, a single cluster dominated by the VLoS path with smooth envelope is observed. On the other hand, in the corridor scenario, some additional clusters introduced by the RIS reflection are created.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Safe Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Joint Design of THz-Enabled UAV Trajectory and Channel Allocation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552119</link><description>6G is anticipated to play a foundational role in realizing various emerging entertainment applications and critical societal services, such as smart agriculture, public safety, and so on. Providing the underlying communications for these applications will substantially increase demand for data rate, reliability, and resiliency. Given these requirements, Terahertz (THz)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are expected to support the essential functions within the future 6G networks. Meanwhile, due to the dynamic environment in a THz-enabled UAV-assisted network with multiple UAVs, using model-free multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) becomes a promising approach to optimize scarce resources. However, satisfying cooperative safety constraints is not guaranteed in most previous MADRL techniques. Consequently, this paper aims to address the cooperative safety guarantee challenge in the joint design problem of UAV trajectory and channel allocation in a THz-enabled UAV-assisted network. Specifically, the goal of the proposed scheme is to maximize energy efficiency, considering the quality of service of each IoT device, the speed limitation of UAVs, and the collision avoidance constraint between UAVs. The problem is mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINP), known as NP-hard to solve. Thus, we propose a novel distributed safe MADRL (DSMADRL) approach for the safe trajectory design of UAVs using a data-driven uniformly ultimate boundedness stability method. Moreover, we theoretically show that the DSMADRL approach guarantees satisfying the cooperative safety constraint of collision avoidance between UAVs as well as maximizing energy efficiency. Furthermore, the matching method is used to allocate THz sub-bands distributively. Finally, the effectiveness of the algorithms is evaluated by comparing them with the existing multi-agent RL algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid-Driven Motion Planning for a Bionic Underwater Vehicle With Gliding Ability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552400</link><description>This study explores an efficient hybrid-driven motion planning method for a bionic underwater vehicle equipped with gliding capabilities, aimed at enhancing the efficiency of autonomous docking while ensuring reliable visual navigation. To achieve this, we first construct and analyze an energy-time consumption model along with a visual navigation stability parameter. These frameworks assess the total energy and time expended, as well as the likelihood of target loss during visual navigation. We then develop a hybrid-driven switching scheme that alternates between two motion modes to approach and dock with a stationary target. A novel motion planning method, based on the deep Q network (DQN) algorithm, is proposed to identify the optimal switching points within this scheme. This method aims to minimize energy and time consumption while maintaining visual navigation stability. The efficacy of the proposed method is validated through both simulation and controlled pool experiments. Results indicate that this hybrid-driven approach not only stabilizes visual navigation but also improves the efficiency of autonomous docking when compared to single-mode strategies. This research contributes to the advancement of hybrid-driven autonomous vehicles and offers new perspectives on the motion planning and control of underwater vehicles with gliding capabilities.</description></item><item><title>Cloud-Edge Collaborative Submap-Based VSLAM Using Implicit Representation Transmission</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10553304</link><description>Applying VSLAM to mobile robots with limited computing power is the key to achieving autonomous navigation, and the cloud-edge collaborative VSLAM is a solution. However, the VSLAM data transmission in the working site with limited communication is still an open problem. To solve this problem, two core issues should be considered: the transmission frequency and the transmission data volume. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous submap building framework to reduce the transmission frequency. Also, we design an implicit representation-based transmission method to save the transmission data volume while satisfying the data association between the edge and the cloud. Through the experiments, our method shows advanced performance in terms of communication demand with low transmission frequency and small data volume. At the same time, comparable precision to the state-of-the-art is achieved, showing the effectiveness of the data association building. Thanks to the reduced transmission frequency and data volume, our system provides a feasible way to the cloud-based VSLAM under limited communication.</description></item><item><title>Secure Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communication in UAV-Enabled NOMA Wireless Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561528</link><description>Combing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in ultra-reliable and low latency communication (uRLLC) is deemed as a new service category of 5G wireless networks. The openness nature of wireless environment makes security of information transmission unprecedentedly importance. Traditional cryptography methods cannot cater to uRLLC due to high complex design and processing delay. As a result, physical layer security (PLS) has been designed to secure information transmission by exploiting intrinsic property of wireless channel. However, many prior works ignored the role of UAV in study of PLS in uRLLC, and mobility of UAV deserves further investigation. This paper studies security and reliability performances of UAV-based uRLLC by using NOMA, where two kinds of users with different requirements are served, i.e., users with privacy and low latency requirement (PLR), and users with reliability and low latency requirement (RLR). With the tools of stochastic geometry, we formulate the secrecy rate, a popular metric in study of PLS, by establishing the closed-form expressions for static and dynamic UAV. Key system parameters (e.g., transmit power allocation) are optimized for secrecy rate maximization. Simulations evaluate theoretical analysis and give a significant insight into a positive secrecy rate for the network designer.</description></item><item><title>Energy Efficiency Maximization for Downlink NOMA Designs via Symbol-Level Precoding</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568396</link><description>The multi-antenna non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique is a promising method to enhance energy and spectrum efficiencies of wireless communication systems through advanced precoding algorithms. However, conventional NOMA schemes encounter high complexity issues due to the successive interference cancellation (SIC) process at the receiver end. Moreover, traditional precoding designs for multi-antenna NOMA systems only utilize user channel state information and overlook the modulation details of transmitted data symbols, which may result in suboptimal performance. To overcome these disadvantages, we propose a symbol-level precoding (SLP) scheme to maximize the energy efficiency of the downlink NOMA systems. In particular, by the proposed SLP scheme, the &#8220;interference signals&#8221; is designed to fall within the decoding region of the &#8220;desired signal&#8221;, eliminating the need for an SIC receiver, thereby reducing the complexity of the NOMA system in practical applications. For ease of illustrating the idea of the SLP-based NOMA designs, we first focus on a single user group case with two users, and solve the associated problem by developing a fractional programming-based algorithm. Then, we extend the idea to the multi-user scenarios and focus on the joint user grouping and SLP design. For the purpose of computational complexity reduction, a low-complexity (adaptive) user grouping scheme is proposed based on the idea of unsupervised clustering. Finally, numerical simulations are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed SLP scheme and algorithms in improving the energy efficiency of the system.</description></item><item><title>Joint MIMO Transceiver and Reflector Design for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted Communication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10553296</link><description>In this paper, we consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output communication system with multiple antennas at both the base station (BS) and the user. We plan to maximize the achievable rate through jointly optimizing the transmit precoding matrix, the receive combining matrix, and the RIS reflection matrix under the constraints of the transmit power at the BS and the unit-modulus reflection at the RIS. Regarding the non-trivial problem form, we initially reformulate it into an considerable problem to make it tractable by utilizing the relationship between the achievable rate and the weighted minimum mean squared error. Next, the transmit precoding matrix, the receive combining matrix, and the RIS reflection matrix are alternately optimized. In particular, the optimal transmit precoding matrix and receive combining matrix are obtained in closed forms. Furthermore, a pair of computationally efficient methods are proposed for the RIS reflection matrix, namely the semi-definite relaxation (SDR) method and the successive closed form (SCF) method. We theoretically prove that both methods are ensured to converge, and the SCF-based algorithm is able to converges to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point of the problem.</description></item><item><title>Interference-Based and Deep-Learning-Aided Physical Layer Security Enhancement in Uplink NOMA Under Cooperative Eavesdropping</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552432</link><description>Physical Layer Security (PLS) for Uplink Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (UL-NOMA) is investigated, under cooperative multi-eavesdropping. Particular attention is paid to the effect that Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) decoding order has over the system secrecy rate. Each NOMA user is subject to an individual minimum bit rate requirement, whereas multiple eavesdroppers cooperate among themselves to enhance their repercussion on the system. We demonstrate the impact SIC decoding order has on the secrecy performance, and the importance to look for an optimal solution to the decoding order selection problem. We show how this problem is indeed a very challenging combinatorial one with a factorial complexity related to the number of users and eavesdroppers involved in the system. Given the high computational power demand to find the optimal solution, we approach the challenge in two ways. First, we propose a near-optimal interference-based analytical approach to find a secure decoding order. The idea is to take advantage of the inherent NOMA characteristic of self-interfere other legitimate users, to also act as an interference source over the eavesdroppers. Secondly, we introduce deep learning as another option to achieve a near-optimal solution with a much lower complexity. We see how a deep neural network is able to improve the performance of the interference-based analytical solution, being robuster to users' and eavesdroppers' increment. Finally, we demonstrate the accuracy of the two proposed solutions through numerical simulations and highlight their importance and advantages.</description></item><item><title>A Dual Mode Multi-Beam and Integrated CPM-LFM Signal for Dual-Functional Radar Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10553227</link><description>Dual-functional radar communication (DFRC) is extremely attractive in the sixth generation systems, since it can simultaneously support communication and detection by a unified hardware platform with real-time cooperation. Considering the appealing features of multiple beams, this paper designs a dual mode multi-beam scheme composed of static and dynamic beams, so that it can simultaneously support multi-user transmission and high-accuracy targets detection. Besides, an integrated continuous phase modulation and linear frequency modulation signal is exploited to improve both range resolution of radar and bit error rate (BER) of users. To unify communication and radar systems, we define radar rate, and set the maximum sum-rate composed of communication and radar rates as the objective function. Since the optimization problem is non-convex, the problem is divided into two sub-issues, i.e., user selection, and joint beamforming design with power allocation. A successive maximum rate algorithm is presented for the former one, which can balance the performances between the sum-rate and complexity; and maximum minimization - Lagrange multiplier iteration algorithm is utilized to solve the latter one. In addition, some theoretical analyses, e.g., spectrum, BER, ambiguity function, false alarm and detection probabilities are deduced for the proposed system. Simulation results show that our proposed DFRC system can provide better sum-rate than the classical communication and radar separated systems.</description></item><item><title>Joint 3D User and 6D Hybrid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Localization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10557771</link><description>The latest assessments of the emerging technologies for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have indicated the concept's significant potential for localization and sensing, either as individual or simultaneously realized tasks. However, in the vast majority of those studies, the RIS state (i.e., its position and rotation angles) is required to be known a priori. In this paper, we address the problem of the joint three-dimensional (3D) localization of a hybrid RIS (HRIS) and a user. The most cost- and power-efficient hybrid version of an RIS is equipped with a single reception radio-frequency chain and meta-atoms capable of simultaneous reconfigurable reflection and sensing. This dual functionality is controlled by adjustable power splitters embedded at each hybrid meta-atom. Focusing on a downlink scenario where a multi-antenna base station transmits multi-carrier signals to a user via an HRIS, we propose a multi-stage approach to jointly estimate the metasurface's 3D position and 3D rotation matrix (i.e., 6D parameter estimation) as well as the user's 3D position. Our simulation results verify the validity of the proposed estimator via extensive comparisons of the root-mean-square error of the state estimations with the Cram&#233;r-Rao lower bound (CRB), which is analytically derived. Furthermore, it is showcased that there exists an optimal hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (HRIS) power splitting ratio for the desired multi-parameter estimation problem. We also study the robustness of the proposed method in the presence of scattering points in the wireless propagation environment.</description></item><item><title>Collaborative Task Offloading Optimization for Satellite Mobile Edge Computing Using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596043</link><description>Satellite mobile edge computing (SMEC) achieves efficient processing for space missions by deploying computing servers on low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, which supplements a strong computing service for future satellite-terrestrial integrated networks. However, considering the spatio-temporal constraints on large-scale LEO networks, inter-satellite cooperative computing is still challenging. In this paper, a multi-agent collaborative task offloading scheme for distributed SMEC is proposed. Facing the time-varying available satellites and service requirements, each autonomous satellite agent dynamically adjusts offloading decisions and resource allocations based on local observations. Furthermore, for evaluating the behavioral contribution of an agent to task completion, we adopt a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on counterfactual multi-agent policy gradients (COMA) to optimize the strategy, which enables energy-efficient decisions satisfying the time and resource restrictions of SMEC. An actor-critic (AC) framework is effectively exploited to separately implement centralized training and distributed execution (CTDE) of the algorithm. We also redesign the actor structure by introducing an attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory network (Atten-BiLSTM) to explore the temporal characteristics of LEO networks. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively enable satellite autonomous collaborative computing in the distributed SMEC environment, and outperforms the benchmark algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Cross-User Dependent Task Offloading and Resource Allocation in Spatial-Temporal Dynamic MEC Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555001</link><description>The emergence of mobile edge computing (MEC) technology opens up new opportunities for the realization of demanding applications proximate to the user. This work aims to capitalize on the constrained resources of MEC networks to efficiently fulfill service requests by jointly optimizing task offloading and resource allocation. However, the growing complexity of applications such as intelligent transportation and autonomous driving introduces new challenges in modeling and problem-solving due to the causal correlation of service logic among various users, which adds to the intricate spatial-temporal dynamics of the network. To effectively capture the essence of cross-user task dependency in these scenarios while also accommodating dynamic factors like the variability of wireless channels and the mobility of terminals, we formulate a spatial-temporal correlative problem, aiming to minimize the weighted cost of task completion delay and energy consumption. To resolve this problem, a Double Deep Q Network (DDQN) is developed for task offloading while integrating subchannel allocation and transmit power control into it to interact with the dynamic environment to generate a reward signal, thereby optimizing the long-term performance of the system. Comprehensive simulations verify that the proposed algorithm surpasses the comparative methods in reducing the cost. Additionally, adaptability in different scenarios with different parameters and task structures has also been validated and analyzed.</description></item><item><title>Leveraging Acoustic AoA to Enhance mmWave Beam Search-Based Blockage Prediction: An Experimental Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10553393</link><description>This paper proposes a novel device-free sensing framework, integrative heterogeneous wave sensing (IHWS). IHWS leverages mmWave angular power profile obtained through beam search and acoustic waves to facilitate wireless sensing focused primarily on blockage prediction in the realm of 6G communication networks. For reliable mmWave communication in realistic environments, mmWave can also serve as a sensing tool for identifying the direction of moving obstacles, such as vehicles, which could potentially cause link blockage. However, the effectiveness of mmWave device-free sensing is initially constrained by the requirement that the target at least has line-of-sight (LOS) to both the base station and user equipment. To mitigate this constraint, we propose an IHWS framework that utilizes motion-induced sound to capture the movement of obstacles and determine their angle of arrival (AoA), thereby enhancing the capabilities of mmWave sensing techniques. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that it is possible to achieve directional localization of the target even outside the LOS region of user equipment and to predict the received power. Moreover, it is confirmed that the directional localization accuracy improves by around 24%, specially when the LOS between the target and user equipment is not necessarily guaranteed.</description></item><item><title>Link Topology and Multi-Objective Mission Flow Optimization for Remote Sensing Satellites With Inter-Layer Links and Satellite-Ground Links</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10557755</link><description>In the future Space Information Network (SIN), remote sensing satellites (RSSs) can access communication constellations (CCs) and ground stations (GSs) through inter-layer links (ILLs) and satellite-ground links (SGLs) to realize the timely transmission of large amounts of observation data. In this paper, we study the link topology of both ILLs and SGLs with different time slot durations from the perspective of each RSS based on the time-expanded graph. We propose a multi-objective mission flow optimization model to jointly achieve transmission benefits maximization, end-of-period energy maximization, and transmission wait time minimization. This model considers missions' importance differences under limited storage, energy, and link bandwidth resources. To reduce the solving complexity and solution time, we propose a Phased Multi-Objective (PMO) algorithm to solve this problem. We simulate the proposed methods in different scale SIN with practical parameters. The results show that RSS's entire orbital period can be covered by ILLs and SGLs, except for the ILLs' handover time. When the ILLs' data transmission rate is much less than the RSSs' data acquisition rate, important mission data can be transmitted in priority. When the transmission rate approaches the data acquisition rate, all observation data can be transmitted in near real-time. The proposed PMO algorithm can obtain the optimal solution in 19.1 seconds for a constellation with 500 satellites, which is much less than the 3.8-minute solution time used by other existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Superposed IM-OFDM (S-IM-OFDM): An Enhanced OFDM for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559944</link><description>Integratedsensing and communications (ISAC) is a critical enabler for emerging 6G applications, and at its core lies in the dual-functional waveform design. While orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been a popular basic waveform, its primitive version falls short in sensing due to the inherent unregulated auto-correlation properties. Furthermore, the sensitivity to Doppler shift hinders its broader applications in dynamic scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a superposed index-modulated OFDM (S-IM-OFDM). The proposed scheme improves the sensing performance without excess power consumption by translating the energy efficiency of IM-OFDM onto sensing-oriented signals over OFDM. Also, it maintains excellent communication performance in time-varying channels by leveraging the sensed parameters to compensate for Doppler. Compared to conventional OFDM, the proposed S-IM-OFDM waveform exhibits better sensing capabilities and wider applicability in dynamic scenarios. Both theoretical analyses and simulations corroborate its dual benefits.</description></item><item><title>Secure Rate Maximization for ISAC-UAV Assisted Communication Amidst Multiple Eavesdroppers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566041</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology have been employed in the field of communication. In this paper, we propose an ISAC-UAV assisted secure communication system amidst multiple eavesdroppers. In each time slot, we implement ISAC and communication functions. Since there are multiple eavesdroppers in the system, jammer UAV is required to send jamming signals to the eavesdroppers. During the ISAC process, the source UAV identifies multiple eavesdroppers, relaying their position information to a jammer UAV. During the communication process, multiple eavesdroppers attempt to intercept the communication link between source UAV and users. We use the center of all users as the horizontal location of the jammer UAV. To maximize the secure data transmit rate, we propose a joint optimization problem involving user scheduling, transmit power, and source UAV trajectory. We break down the non-convex optimization problem into three subproblems, and then achieve the suboptimal solution to the original problem through iteratively optimizing these subproblems. Simulation results indicate that the proposed solution can achieve significant secure transmit rate even in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers.</description></item><item><title>Performance Analysis of IRS Assisted Full-Duplex Systems With Different Downlink and Uplink Users</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10584312</link><description>In this work, we investigate a full-duplex network assisted by an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) involving both downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users in the same frequency band with best user selection. The IRS is partitioned into two zones to cater to each of DL and UL users. Our analysis incorporates factors such as residual self-interference, co-channel interference, and hardware imperfections, considering a direct link over generalized Nakagami-m fading channels. We derive analytical expressions for outage probability (OP), system outage probability (SOP), and ergodic rate. We also investigate the joint allocation of element splitting between the zones, user power allocations, and reflection amplitude with SOP minimization and ergodic sum rate maximization as objectives. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations are conducted to validate the analytical expressions.</description></item><item><title>On Performance of Backscatter-NOMA Systems: Symbiotic Communication for IoT Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568552</link><description>Backscatter communication and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are emerging paradigms in wireless communication offering promising solutions to enhance spectral and energy efficiency of energy-constrained devices in 6G networks. This work introduces a symbiotic radio system tailored for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and proposes an innovative framework that integrates backscatter-based IoT devices into the NOMA network. In this proposed system, the primary base station employs NOMA principles to serve both far and near users simultaneously. The IoT network consists of an IoT device equipped with a backscattering device that transmits its information over the primary signal, fostering a symbiotic relationship between the two. The IoT transmitter not only serves the IoT receiver but also concurrently enhances performance of the far user. This paper delves into an extensive analysis of the outage probabilities for the NOMA and IoT networks. The outage probability of the far user is obtained for the cases with and without a direct link between the primary base station and the far user. The obtained results clearly demonstrate a significant performance improvement over orthogonal multiple access techniques. Finally, we employ Monte Carlo simulations to validate the accuracy of the derived theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Quality of Experience Optimization for Real-Time XR Video Transmission With Energy Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10589538</link><description>Extended Reality (XR) is an important service in the 5G network and in future 6G networks. In contrast to traditional video on demand services, real-time XR video is transmitted frame-by-frame, requiring low latency and being highly sensitive to network fluctuations. In this paper, we model the quality of experience (QoE) for real-time XR video transmission on a frame-by-frame basis. Based on the proposed QoE model, we formulate an optimization problem that maximizes QoE with constraints on wireless resources and long-term energy consumption. We utilize Lyapunov optimization to transform the original problem into a single-frame optimization problem and then allocate wireless subchannels. We propose an adaptive XR video bitrate algorithm that employs a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm for video bitrate selection. Through numerical results, we show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the baseline algorithms, with the average QoE improvements of 0.04 to 0.46. Specifically, compared to baseline algorithms, the proposed algorithm reduces average video quality variations by 29% to 50% and improves the frame transmission success rate by 5% to 48%.</description></item><item><title>Spectral Efficiency Maximization Oriented Joint Optimization for RIS-Aided mmWave IABN: An Alternating Iterative Optimization Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10598395</link><description>In this correspondence, we investigate the joint optimization for an uplink reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter wave integrated access and backhaul network (mmWave IABN) to maximize the spectral efficiency (SE). When the bandwidth partition ratio between the access part and the backhaul part is given, the sum end-to-end rate maximized problem is firstly formulated and equivalently transformed as the SE maximization oriented joint optimization under the constraints including the users' transmission power and signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) requirement, and the RIS's unit mode. Secondly, an alternating iterative optimization approach is designed to obtain a nearly-optimal solution by solving the two subproblems (i.e., power control at the users and phase-shift manipulation at the RIS), which are decomposed from the original problem based on the successive convex approximation. Thirdly, the sum SE superiority of the proposed approach is demonstrated through the comparison with other baselines under different settings. In addition, the convergence of the proposed approach and the impact of the bandwidth partition ratio on the system performance are validated.</description></item><item><title>Interference Analysis for Coexistence of UAVs and Civil Aircrafts Based on Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10557637</link><description>Due to the advantages of high mobility and easy deployment, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are widely applied in both military and civilian fields. In order to strengthen the flight surveillance of UAVs and guarantee the airspace safety, UAVs can be equipped with the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) system, which periodically sends flight information to other aircrafts and ground stations (GSs). However, due to the limited resource of channel capacity, UAVs equipped with ADS-B results in the interference between UAVs and civil aircrafts (CAs), which further impacts the accuracy of received information at GSs. In detail, the channel capacity is mainly affected by the density of aircrafts and the transmitting power of ADS-B. Hence, based on the three-dimensional poisson point process, this work leverages the stochastic geometry theory to build a model of the coexistence of UAVs and CAs and analyze the interference performance of ADS-B monitoring system. From simulation results, we reveal the effects of transmitting power, density, threshold and pathloss on the performance of the ADS-B monitoring system. Besides, we provide the suggested transmitting power and density for the safe coexistence of UAVs and CAs.</description></item><item><title>Cox Point Processes for Multi Altitude LEO Satellite Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10557592</link><description>To model existing or future low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks leveraging multiple constellations, we propose a simple analytical approach to represent the clustering of satellites on orbits. More precisely, we develop a variable-altitude Poisson orbit process that effectively captures the geometric fact that satellites are always positioned on orbits, and these orbits may vary in altitude. Conditionally on the orbit process, satellites situated on these orbits are modeled as linear Poisson point processes, thereby forming a Cox point process. For this model, we derive useful statistics, including the distribution of the distance from the typical user to its nearest visible satellite, the outage probability, the Laplace functional of the proposed Cox satellite point process, and the Laplace transform of the interference power from the Cox-distributed satellites under general fading. The derived statistics enable the evaluation of the performance of such LEO satellite communication systems as functions of network parameters.</description></item><item><title>Photovoltaics and Agriculture Nexus: Exploring the Influence of Agrivoltaics on Food Production and Electricity Generation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10613921</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) installations contribute to more sustainable solutions in satisfying clean energy requirements and are essential to global efforts to mitigate climate change. The PV development has extensive space requirements, complicated by the increasing competition for land due to rising population growth and food demand. By installing solar panels on agricultural land, agrivoltaic (APV) offers a resource-efficient solution to the persistent problem of competition for arable lands. This study presents a systematic review of the impact of APV applications on crop yields, agricultural product quality, plant growth microclimate, power generation, human comfort level, economic benefits, and social welfare. In total, 138 APV studies were reviewed in five typical agricultural scenarios, including open-field farming, greenhouse, aquaculture, livestock farming, and forestry, and 34 articles summarized the main metrics for evaluating APV performance. The majority of studies indicate positive impacts of APV on open-field agricultural practices. APV coverage of less than 20% on the greenhouse roof has minimal adverse effects. Livestock farming APV helps reduce heat stress and improve animal welfare. Deploying APV panels in aquaculture fishery mitigates the rise in water temperature and improves water quality. The quantitative analysis and investigation of the impact of APV on agricultural production in this study help develop efficient APV systems worldwide.</description></item><item><title>Improvement of Laser Contact Opening in Bifacial PERC Solar Cells by Optimizing the Dashed Pattern</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10577474</link><description>The laser contact opening in passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) is essential for establishing contact between silicon and aluminum. On bifacial PERC solar cells, dashed patterns are commonly employed as an alternative to continuous openings to mitigate excessive losses associated with passivation film removal. In this work, we investigate the optimization of dashed patterns in detail. First, under the condition of the same 50% opening ratio, the optimal total length of segments is determined to be 1.2 mm. Subsequently, testing various opening ratio patterns on wafers with different resistivities reveals that low-resistivity wafers are better suited for low opening ratio patterns. Finally, simulation analyses using Quokka2 software assess the variations in power loss associated with different opening patterns, the simulation results align with those of experiments. This work provides a guidance for the rear-side laser opening pattern design of bifacial PERC solar cells.</description></item><item><title>Development of APCVD BSG and POCl3 Codiffusion Process for Double-Side TOPCon Solar Cell Precursor Fabrication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599136</link><description>This article presents a commercially viable process for fabricating a high-quality double-side tunnel oxide passivating contact (DS-TOPCon) cell precursor using atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition deposited boron silicate glass and ex situ POCl3 diffusion in a single high-temperature step, eliminating the need for additional masking and diffusion processes. A two-tier temperature profile was developed, involving a preannealing at above 900 &#176;C in nitrogen ambient followed by POCl3 diffusion at 840 &#176;C. We investigated the effect of varying preannealing temperatures, ranging from 875 to 950 &#176;C, on the passivation quality and metal-Si contact properties of both n-TOPCon and p-TOPCon layers. The resultant DS-TOPCon cell precursor after silicon nitride passivation exhibited an excellent iVOC of close to 730 mV. In addition, a rapid asymmetric poly-Si thinning technique, developed in this work, enabled adjustment of the front n+ poly-Si thickness while maintaining the rear p+ poly-Si thickness. Two types of DS-TOPCon cell architectures can be fabricated: i) full-area thin (&#8776;40 nm) n-TOPCon layer on the front and ii) selective-area thick (&#8776;200 nm) n-TOPCon fingers underneath the metal grid. Device simulations suggest that full-area DS-TOPCon cell with 40 nm n+ poly-Si and selective-area DS-TOPCon cell with 200 nm n+ poly fingers on the front, fabricated from our current DS-TOPCon cell precursor, can achieve cell efficiencies of 22.1% and 23.5%, respectively. Detailed power loss analysis and device simulation reveal that further improvements in material and device parameters have the potential to push the cell efficiencies of DS-TOPCon cell structure beyond 25%, making it a promising alternative to fabricate high-efficiency next-generation solar cells at low cost.</description></item><item><title>CdSe With Mixed Zincblende and Wurtzite Phases Grown on Lattice-Matched InAs Substrates Using Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10584072</link><description>The II&#8211;VI compound semiconductor CdSe, which has both zincblende (ZB) and wurtzite (WZ) phases with bandgap energies of 1.67 and 1.74 eV, respectively, is an ideal candidate material for the top cell in a tandem solar cell with a Si bottom cell to achieve higher power conversion efficiency. In this work, molecular beam epitaxy growth of CdSe thin films on lattice-matched InAs(100) substrates reveals a single-phase ZB structure with high crystallinity and a low defect density. In contrast, all CdSe layers grown on InAs(111)B substrates have mixed ZB and WZ phases in coexistence, as confirmed by high-resolution X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The PL efficiencies of the CdSe layers grown on (111)B substrates are substantially lower than those grown on (100) substrates. This result is attributed to defects at the boundaries between the two different phases. Postgrowth annealing of CdSe layers grown on InAs(111)B at 250&#8211;450&#8201;&#176;C converts most of the CdSe ZB material into the WZ phase, as evidenced by improved PL efficiency and TEM images. Density functional theory simulations confirm that the formation energy difference between the ZB and WZ phases for CdSe is very small compared with other conventional compound semiconductors, which is in good agreement with the experimental observations.</description></item><item><title>Photovoltaic Cable Connectors: A Comparative Assessment of the Present State of the Industry</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596700</link><description>The consequences of failure for balance-of-systems components (such as photovoltaic (PV) cable connectors) include offline module string(s); low system voltage; arc, ground, insulation, and overtemperature faults; triggered fuse(s); system shutdown; and fire. The degradation modes for connectors are studied here through an industry survey and its subsequent examination, which are compared with field-degraded specimens. A total of 117 specimens were obtained from a variety of locations and climates or accelerated tests. A failure analysis for connectors from PV installations was developed (and applied to 54 specimens), including nondestructive examinations (photography, a custom resistance&#8211;current scan, and X-ray computed tomography) and destructive examinations (featuring milling of the external plastic, extraction of the internal convolute spring, and potting and polishing in cross section). Surface and through-thickness composition of the metal pins and springs was quantified using scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to verify the base polymer materials and compare the chemical structure of the connector body, bushing, end nut, and o-ring. Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were used to further verify the degradation of the same polymeric components.</description></item><item><title>Irradiance Monitoring for Bifacial PV Systems&#8217; Performance and Capacity Testing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614655</link><description>Three standards for photovoltaic (PV) performance and capacity testing are evaluated for bifacial PV system reporting: performance ratio, ASTM E2848, and a new draft of IEC 61724-2. In this context, challenges and recommendations for rear irradiance instrumentation are described for three types of bifacial irradiance sensors&#8212;horizontal albedometer, backward-facing reference cells (or pyranometer), and bifacial reference module. A year of operating field data for single-axis tracked bifacial and monofacial systems was collected, including periods of high surface albedo due to snow ground cover. If snowy conditions are included, we found that all three methods performed comparably to the monofacial baseline case, but only if rear-measured irradiance is incorporated into the expected energy calculation. The lowest RMS error was obtained by following the draft IEC 61724-2 standard and using a calibrated bifacial reference module for bifacial irradiance resource. If measured rear irradiance is unavailable, field conditions either need to be filtered to avoid variable (snowy) albedo or an albedometer measurement can be used in conjunction with modeled rear irradiance along with the draft IEC procedure. Additional practical factors are described, including the proper placement of rear irradiance sensors and the proper interpretation of IEC 61724-1 bifacial performance ratio calculations.</description></item><item><title>A Global Nonlinear Model for Photovoltaic Modules Based on 3-D Surface Fitting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568301</link><description>The main objective of this work is to propose a global nonlinear model (GNLM), valid under varying solar irradiance (G) and temperature (T) conditions, generating characteristic curves that closely replicate the actual behavior of the evaluated modules. The proposed GNLM incorporates a technique that combines surface polynomial fitting based on numerical optimization. This integration results in the creation of unique adaptable surfaces for each parameter, providing them with flexibility. Additionally, the research also aims to investigate other nonlinear global models for photovoltaic modules and conduct a comparative study of accuracy. The proposed model demonstrated significantly superior results compared with the best model evaluated in the literature for xSi modules, with a normalized mean absolute error in power (NMAEP) percentage difference of 98.21% and a normalized root mean square deviation (NRMSD) difference of 25.60%. In contrast, for mSi modules, the results showed a slight improvement over the same model, with an NMAEP percentage difference of 26.19% and an NRMSD difference of 1.52%. Similarly, for CdTe modules, there was an NMAEP percentage difference of &#8722;0.84% and an NRMSD difference of 12.82%.</description></item><item><title>Abrasion of PV Antireflective Coatings by Robot Cleaning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568306</link><description>The growing use of photovoltaic (PV) cleaning machines (&#8220;robots&#8221;) raises the risk of abrasion to the antireflective coating (ARC) on modules&#8217; front glass. ARC abrasion is often studied via accelerated lab tests, however field tests are needed to achieve real-world abrasion conditions. In this study nine types of PV modules and five types of ARC coupons were subjected to 18 months of dry-brush robot cleaning in the desert climate of Doha, Qatar. Three cleaning schedules were tested: daily, weekly, and never (reference samples subject to weathering alone). Modules&#8217; power (Pmax), current (Isc), and reflectivity changes were measured and compared between the various cleaning schedules. It was found that the abrasion resistance of PV modules varied greatly. Five kinds of module showed greater losses with more frequent cleaning, while the other four did not. Lab profilometry of the coupons similarly found large variability of the depth and quantity of scratches for different ARCs, because of the difference in ARC durability between modules, and the likelihood that different cleaning robots will vary in their harshness, it is recommended to test specific robot/module pairs in the field to be confident of their ARC degradation rate.</description></item><item><title>A Method for the Estimation of Missing Strings in Very-Large-Scale Photovoltaic Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10613882</link><description>This article presents a novel methodology to detect missing strings in very-large-scale photovoltaic (VLSPV) systems, utilizing only data acquired at the stringbox level.

However, due to the characteristics of high power and low supply voltage in CHI systems, heavy currents need to flow through the power delivery network (PDN), and the Joule heating effect will result in the overall temperature increase of the CHI system. Meanwhile, the high temperature will cause the current as well as the performance of the system to degrade and a series of reliability problems will occur. In this article, an effective electrical-thermal coupling model is proposed to predict the steady-state temperature distribution of a 2.5-D CHI system considering the Joule heating effect and the temperature effect on the IR drop. The equivalent electrical conductivity model is also built up to describe the design features of the redistribution layer (RDL), bump, and through silicon via (TSV) structures based on the electrical-thermal duality. Furthermore, the governing equations for voltage distribution and temperature distribution are solved simultaneously by utilizing the finite volume method (FVM) with nonuniform mesh to realize the electrical-thermal co-simulation of the multiscale CHI system. The model application is further performed to investigate the influence of the model parameters on the voltage drop and temperature distribution of the CHI system. The verified systems and simulated results of the present investigation demonstrate the viability and accuracy of voltage and temperature field co-simulation and indicate that the new proposed electrical-thermal model is helpful in thermal and voltage drop analysis of packaging structures with the Joule heating effect and can be adopted to assist in the physical design optimization of 2.5-D CHI or 3-D heterogeneous stacked chips.</description></item><item><title>A Dual-Mode Buck Converter with Light-Load Efficiency Improvement and Seamless Mode Transition Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10591729</link><description>In order to improve the efficiency over a wide load range, a power converter of the Internet of Things (IoT) usually works in dual modes, which are pulsewidth modulation (PWM) and pulse frequency modulation (PFM). A mixed load detection scheme is adopted to enable the appropriate modes under different loads, whose analog detector has an accurate detection in the heavy load, and the digital load detection improves the light-load efficiency. When the power converter operates in different modes, the control loops are different. Meanwhile, a seamless mode transition technique (SMTT) is presented in this article to improve the transient response during mode change between PWM and PFM. A test chip was fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $ m standard CMOS process, and the chip area is  $1.59\times 1.37$  mm2. The experimental results show that the efficiency is above 85.3% under  $V_{\text {IN}}=3.3$  V,  $V_{\text {OUT}}=1.8$  V, and in the load range from 1 to 300 mA, while peak efficiency can reach 96.1% at 100-mA load.

A three-stage amplifier, which expands the dual-path structure and buffering-based pole relocation amplifier through the graph domain inspection by using the graph rules, is proposed. By adding order of denominator in main fraction of the equivalent impedance of active zero block, the proposed amplifier can effectively increase the driving ability while enhancing the amplifier&#8217;s stability for a large range of capacitive load.

The proposed conjugation method provides an internal high-impedance node, by which the transconductance of the amplifier is significantly increased. Since the central node of the conjugated CMs is virtually grounded for small differential signals, the cascode devices of the diode-connected topologies can be employed as an extra differential pair causing a further enhancement in transconductance. Moreover, the large signal behavior of the circuit shows that the conjugated CMs are capable of copying a dynamic current with a higher gain in comparison with a traditional CM amplifier. This advantage results in faster charging and discharging of the output capacitive load, which provides a larger slew rate (SR) without increasing the quiescent current. The proposed amplifier was manufactured with TSMC 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS technology occupying a silicon area of  $55.5\times 48.9~\mu $ m. Experimental results at a supply voltage of 1.8 V show a gain bandwidth (GBW) of 104.9 MHz, a dc gain of 79.1 dB, and an SR of 55.7 V/ $\mu $ s for a capacitive load of 10 pF, while the circuit consumes 489- $\mu $ W power.</description></item><item><title>A 20-V Pulse Driver Based on All-nMOS Charge Pump Without Reversion Loss and Overstress in 65-nm Standard CMOS Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10633274</link><description>This article proposes a high-efficiency all-nMOS bidirectional charge pump (CP) cell and constructs a CP-based high-voltage (HV) pulse driver based on it. Double-diode substrate isolation (DDSI) can extend the maximum supported voltage in a bulk CMOS process, but it requires an all-nMOS implementation of CP cells. Existing all-nMOS CPs either do not support the bidirectional charge transfer required for HV pulse drivers, or achieve it with additional penalties such as reversion charge loss and overstress on transistors. The proposed all-nMOS CP with novel gate voltage control strategies is the first one reported in the literature that can support the bidirectional charge transfer required for HV pulse drivers without suffering from reversion loss and threshold voltage loss or causing overstress on transistors. A ten-stage CP-based HV pulse driver is implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process utilizing this cell. Postlayout simulation results demonstrate that it can reliably generate 20-V HV pulses from a 2.5 V supply for a 15 pF // 200 k $\Omega $  load at 55 kHz. The driver exhibits a peak power efficiency of 46.4% and occupies an area of 0.262 mm2.</description></item><item><title>Model-Based Study on the Limit of the Dynamic Load Regulation Performance of a Digital Low Dropout Regulator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10601616</link><description>A digital low dropout (DLDO) regulator is one of the most critical building blocks in on-chip power management for its technology portability, voltage scalability, and other benefits associated with digital-oriented design. A key metric of DLDOs is the dynamic load regulation performance, often measured as the maximum current that a DLDO can quickly supply upon a significant load step under a voltage droop constraint (usually 10% of the output voltage). Previous works focused on architecture and circuit techniques to improve this metric. However, limited research focuses on the model development for the dynamic load regulation performance. To fill this gap, in this article, we propose the analytical models of the maximum load current of the standard DLDOs employing feedback and feedforward control laws. The developed models shed light on the impact of various design parameters on the total load current of a DLDO, with which both circuit and system designers can navigate the design space quickly and effectively.</description></item><item><title>An Injection-Locked and Sub-Sampling Clock Multiplier With a Two-Step SC DAC Achieving 2.67% Jitter Variation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10571831</link><description>This article presents an injection-locked clock multiplier (ILCM) using a digitally controlled frequency-tracking loop (FTL) with an integral two-step switched-capacitor (SC) digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Conventionally, the DAC resolution needs to be increased for low noise at the cost of degraded monotonicity due to device mismatch. To overcome this tradeoff, the proposed DAC utilizes the SC technique to achieve fine steps. With only two capacitors involved in charge transfer, the DAC is inherently monotonic, avoiding the boundary-crossing issue and the mismatch calibration. A control-voltage-tracking loop (CVTL) further suppresses the quantization noise by balancing the up and down step sizes and helps achieve a 16-bit-level voltage step. The FTL is sub-sampling and utilizes a bang-bang phase detector (BBPD). Locking at 700 MHz, the ILCM achieves a 0.9-ps integrated jitter, a -125-dBc/Hz phase noise at a 1-MHz offset, and a small jitter variation of 2.67% under different supply voltages and temperatures.

However, design efficiency of asynchronous circuits remains low and faces challenges in large-scale applications because of the lack of electronic design automation (EDA) support. This article presents a new bundled-data (BD) asynchronous circuits&#8217; design flow using traditional EDA tools, including a new backward delay propagation constraint (BDPC) method. In this method, control paths and data paths are analyzed together in a tightly coupled approach to improve the accuracy of static timing analysis (STA). Compared with other design flows, the proposed design flow and constraint method show significant advantages in aspects of STA accuracy, design efficiency, and design applicability, and solving the congestion issues of field-programmable gate array (FPGA) in a previous work. An asynchronous RISC-V processor was implemented to verify the method, with selective handshake technology to further reduce power. Compared with the synchronous processor, the asynchronous processor achieves a 17.4% power optimization on the TSMC 65-nm process and a 48.3% dynamic power savings on the FPGA while maintaining the same frequency and resource utilization.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Two-Stage Pipelined Compute-in-Memory Macro for Accelerating Transformer Feed-Forward Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614387</link><description>Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various applications. However, deploying transformer models on resource-constrained platforms is still challenging due to its dynamic workloads, intensive computations, and substantial memory access. In this article, we propose a two-stage pipelined compute-in-memory (CIM) macro for effectively deploying and accelerating the feed-forward network (FFN) layers of transformer models. Two independent CIM arrays are designed to execute the two distinct linear projections in FFN layers, which are interconnected by co-designed analog rectified linear unit (ReLU) circuits to realize the nonlinear activation function. The analog multiply-and-add (MAC) results from the first CIM array are streamed directly to the analog ReLU circuits, and subsequently to the next CIM array for performing another linear projection. This architecture eliminates the need for analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs) for internal results&#8217; staging, thereby enhancing overall macro efficiency and reducing computing latency. A proof-of-concept macro is fabricated using TSMC 65-nm process and achieves 4.096 TOPS peak throughput, 4.39 TOPS/mm2 area efficiency, and 49.83 TOPS/W energy efficiency. To map transformer models onto the proposed macro, we quantize the FFN layers of BERTMINI model under per-token granularity for activations and per-tensor granularity for weights using quantization-aware training (QAT), which exhibits excellent accuracy across multiple benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Area Efficient 0.009-mm2&#160;28.1-ppm/&#176;C 11.3-MHz ALL-MOS Relaxation Oscillator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10576630</link><description>This article presents an ultrasmall area on-chip relaxation oscillator with low-temperature sensitivity. In this design, a virtual resistor mainly composed of a complementary to absolute temperature (CTAT) voltage reference circuit is implemented to replace the real resistor for efficient temperature compensation, which counterbalances the inherent proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) property of the original relaxation circuit of the oscillator. The conventional capacitor is also replaced with a MOS capacitor to complete the ALL-MOS oscillator circuit with two prime advantages, one of which is larger capacitance to area density, and the other is better matching with critical MOSFETs. Implemented in a 0.18- $\mu $ m TSMC standard CMOS process, the proposed relaxation oscillator has achieved a temperature coefficient of 28.17 ppm/&#176;C over the temperature range from  $- 25~^{\circ }$ C to  $+ 125~^{\circ }$ C at 11.39-MHz oscillation frequency. This circuit consumes  $243.1~\mu $ W under 1.3-V power supply. Along with the abovementioned excellent performance, the oscillator achieves an ultrasmall core chip area of 0.009 mm2, which is almost one order less than most of the prior arts&#8217; in the same process.</description></item><item><title>Protecting Parallel Data Encryption in Multi-Tenant FPGAs by Exploring Simple but Effective Clocking Methodologies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10579855</link><description>Capitalizing on their versatility and high-performance attributes within heterogeneous designs, increasingly number of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are integrated into cloud data centers by cloud service providers (CSPs). While CSPs intend to reduce the cost by sharing one board among multiple users (called multi-tenant FPGA), hardware security problems such as side-channel attacks restrict it from spreading commercially. Existing research works have underscored the feasibility of remote side-channel attacks targeting a singular advanced encryption standard (AES) module on multi-tenant FPGAs, but they have not looked into the scenario of parallel data encryption on multiple AES modules for a single tenant, which is possible due to the small resource consumption of one AES module. In this work, we scrutinize correlation power analysis (CPA)-based side-channel attacks on parallel data encryption modules and develop two simple yet effective protective methods based on clocking methodologies&#8212;clocking phase shift and small frequency shift. The former technique adopts an identical clock frequency but with distinctive clocking phase to parallel encryption modules while the latter implements slightly different clock frequencies for parallel encryption modules. Experimental results show that both the methods can effectively increase the minimum required power traces for successful CPA, thus instituting a natural protective barrier for parallel data encryption.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Cost Quadruple-Node-Upsets Resilient Latch Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614215</link><description>In this article, a low-cost quadruple-node-upsets resilient latch (LCQRL) design is proposed. To meet the high-reliability demands of safety-critical applications, the latch integrates nine soft-error-interceptive modules (SIMs) to form robust feedback loops, ensuring complete resilience to quadruple-node upsets (QNUs).

The proposed structure employs a new high-gain stage as a feedback network between the input node of each cell and the common node of the circuit to reduce the sensitivity of the output current to the loser signals, especially when they are close to the winner. In addition, another network is employed that senses the amount of the output/winner current and adjusts the bias current of the gain stages. This ensures that the drain-source voltage of the input transistor in the winner cell matches the behavior of the output transistor&#8217;s drain-source voltage, enhancing the accuracy as well as the input dynamic range (DR) of the structure. Moreover, since the circuit works properly with a minimum supply voltage of only  $V_{\text {GS}} + V_{\text {eff}}$ , it is a promising candidate for applications in emerging technologies with low supply voltage requirements. Based on the proposed structure, a three-input WTA circuit is designed and fabricated in a 0.18- $\mu $  m CMOS technology. According to the measurement results, the proposed circuit exhibits a maximum error of 1.5% for the input signal range of  $60~\mu $  A when the input frequency is 100 kHz. The silicon area occupied by the circuit is  $33~\mu $  m  $\times 65~\mu $  m.</description></item><item><title>Securing Against Side-Channel Attacks With Wide-Range In Situ Random Voltage Dithering on Async-Logic AES Engine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10555024</link><description>We present a wide-range in situ random voltage dithering (WIS-RVD) on async-logic advanced encryption standard (AES) engine to counteract side-channel attacks (SCAs). There are three contributions in this brief. First, we propose the WIS-RVD based on a dual-rail asynchronous-logic (async-logic) AES engine, leveraging on the self-timed clockless operations for robust encryption under dynamic voltage and timing variations. Second, we propose an in situ voltage dithering to dither the supply voltage instantaneously during the encryption, without the requirement of additional control circuits for clock modulation, to increase the SCA resistance. Third, we propose a wide-range voltage swing technique that spans from 0.3 V (subthreshold) to 1.1 V (above threshold), obfuscating the transistor&#8217;s current models between subthreshold and threshold voltage to further enhance SCA resistance. We perform comprehensive SCA evaluations with 50-M power and EM measurements, and the SCA evaluations show that our proposed WIS-RVD on async-logic AES accelerator can resist SCAs with 50-M measurements, i.e.,  $\gt 2083\times $  and  $\gt 2778\times $  improvement for power and EM SCAs, respectively, when compared to the standard synchronous-logic AES.</description></item><item><title>A Hardware and Software Co-Design for Energy-Efficient Neural Network Accelerator With Multiplication-Less Folded-Accumulative PE for Radar-Based Hand Gesture Recognition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559442</link><description>This work presents a novel lightweight neural network (NN) model and a dedicated NN accelerator for radar-based hand gesture recognition (HGR).

Hybrid-packaged technology is employed, consisting of one TX/RX 65-nm CMOS beamformer and four 0.1- $\mu \text{m}$  GaAs power amplifiers (PAs)/low-noise amplifiers (LNAs). Each beam maintains a full connection to every antenna element without degrading array gain. A compact and symmetrical layout floor-plan is proposed to reduce signal routing complexity. Signal distribution and combination are performed through two optimized tree-type and rectangular-shaped beamforming networks to improve the beam-to-beam consistency and isolation. The TX/RX CMOS beamformer provides an energy-efficient solution by adopting low-power phase/amplitude controls. The second harmonic trap is co-optimized with the transformer-based matching to enhance linearity in the TX. A new L-type inductor-enhanced matching network is devised in the RX to broaden bandwidth.

However, challenges still lie in large memory cells, network mapping, and IR-drop variation to realize efficient CIM implementation. In this work, a 28-nm 36 Kb static random-access memory (SRAM) CIM engine with nondestructive-read (NDR) cell and weight update energy saving is used for multiply-accumulate (MAC) acceleration in artificial intelligence (AI) inference and train applications. A 4T1T SRAM bit-cell is proposed with NDR and records the smallest cell size of  $0.173~\mu $ m2. The power-ON self-load-0 feature of the 4T1T cell saves the weight update energy and latency for writing 0. The shared-path dual-mode read (SPDMR) brings fewer circuit overheads to support both FF and BP paths. The bit-interleaving weight mapping (BIWM) speeds up the BP path without slowing FF. IR-drop-aware adaptive clampers (IRDAA-Cs) with hierarchical read word-lines (RWLs) and read bit-lines (RBLs) apply possibly accurate voltages on near/far cells. The engine achieves an EE of 263.1/412.1 TOPS/W, as well as an area efficiency (AE) of 2.5/4.9 TOPS/mm2 for FF/BP process @1-bit weight/activation with 74.4%&#8211;78.3% reduction in weight update energy.</description></item><item><title>Cryo-CMOS Dual-Qubit Homodyne Reflectometer Array With Degenerate Parametric Amplification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614653</link><description>In quantum computers, the quantum state discrimination of the physical quantum bits (Qubits) occupies ~80% of the quantum error correction (QEC) cycle.

Compared to their dc counterparts, the RF reflectometers enjoy a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), low drifting, and fast speed. As a result, a high-fidelity, single-shot, scalable reflectometer array based on cryogenic CMOS (Cryo-CMOS) ICs is in demand for the future large-scale Qubit array ( $10^{3} {\sim } 10^{6}$  Qubits). However, the classic Cryo-CMOS heterodyne reflectometers, consisting of MOSFET-based LNA, mixer, and baseband blocks, suffer from high noise temperature and dc power. To address these issues, the Cryo-CMOS parametric circuitry based on varactors is explored. In this article, a dual-Qubit homodyne reflectometer array with 2 RX channels and 1 TX channel is demonstrated. In the RX, the degenerate parametric amplifier (DPA) enjoys a Q-enhanced,  $\lambda _{\mathrm { RF}}/2$  differential-mode (DM) resonator for the high-gain parametric amplification. The common mode (CM) RF input of DPA interacts with the DM resonator by a nonreciprocal, dynamic mode coupling (DMC). It eliminates the necessity of a circulator and the potential oscillation of DPA. The scalability challenge of the DPA&#8217;s noise temperature  $T_{\mathrm { noise}}$  versus the environment temperature  $T_{\mathrm { env}}$  is also investigated. In the TX, a current-mode logic (CML) divider with interstate locking and a vector modulator (VM) is implemented to achieve fast modulation for the spur and noise rejection. Measured at 4.2 K, the implemented 65 nm Cryo-CMOS chip presents a  $4.5{\sim }7$  GHz bandwidth, 52 dB peak RF gain, and 78 K noise temperature, and generates a 10 MHz TX pulse train with -22 dBm RF power and 30 dB tunability. It consumes a total dc power of 33 mW.</description></item><item><title>A 4 ns Settling Time FVF-Based Fast LDO Using Bandwidth Extension Techniques for HBM3</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614658</link><description>This article introduces a novel low-dropout (LDO) regulator based on a flipped-voltage follower (FVF) design, achieving a rapid 4 ns settling time.

However, the high cost of computation and memory footprint make its inference inefficient. Although digital compute-in-memory (CIM) is a promising hardware architecture with high accuracy, Transformer&#8217;s attention mechanism raises three challenges in the access and computation of CIM: 1) the attention computation involving Query and Key results in massive data movement and under-utilization in CIM macros; 2) the attention computation involving Possibility and Value exhibits plenty of dynamic bit-level sparsity, resulting in redundant bit-serial CIM operations; and 3) the restricted data reload bandwidth in CIM macros results in a significant decrease in performance for large Transformer models. To address these challenges, we design a CIM accelerator called CIM Transformer (CIMFormer) with three corresponding features. First, the token-pruning-aware attention reformulation (TPAR) is a technique that adjusts attention computations according to the token-pruning ratio. This reformulation reduces the real-time access to and under-utilization of CIM macros. Second, the principal possibility gather-scatter scheduler (PPGSS) gathers the possibilities with greater effective bit-width as concurrent inputs to CIM macros, enhancing the efficiency of bit-serial CIM operations. Third, the systolic X $\mid $ W-CIM macro array efficiently handles the execution of large Transformer models that exceed the storage capacity of the on-chip CIM macros. Fabricated in a 28-nm technology, CIMFormer achieves a peak energy efficiency of 15.71 TOPS/W, with an over  $1.46{\times }$  improvement compared with the state-of-the-art Transformer accelerator at an equivalent situation.</description></item><item><title>LOG-CIM: An Energy-Efficient Logarithmic Quantization Computing-In-Memory Processor With Exponential Parallel Data Mapping and Zero-Aware 6T Dual-WL Cell</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10541941</link><description>This article introduces the logarithmic quantization computing-in-memory processor (LOG-CIM), an advanced processor that extends the capabilities of conventional linear quantization (INT) by integrating logarithmic quantization (LOGQ) into computing-in-memory (CIM) architectures. Emphasizing three key features, the LOG-CIM significantly achieves high energy efficiency and memory density using LOGQ: 1) exponential parallel data mapping (EPDM) not only facilitates efficient shifted alignment and data accumulation, optimizing the processing pipeline for LOGQ complex computations but also achieves a 51.5% improvement in energy efficiency as a result; 2) the implementation of a zero-aware dual-word-line (ZADU) cell, which not only enhances parallelism but also reduces computation power by lowering read power 88.9% for 89.3% bit sparsity; and 3) shift-addition peripheral (SAP) logic, which maximizes throughput by performing the addition of different bit positions from two data read by the ZADU cell before they enter the adder tree, thereby enhancing 24.3% energy efficiency. The LOG-CIM is fabricated in 28-nm CMOS technology and occupies a 5.832 mm2 with a total of 48-kB on-chip CIMs. It achieves 192 TOPS/W using conventional data mapping at 4-b INT weight and 4-b input activation and 116.4 TOPS/W using EPDM at 4-b LOGQ weight and 8-b INT input activation at 120-MHz clock and 0.85-V supply voltage with the ResNet-50 @ ImageNet dataset. When using the 4-b LOGQ weight for inference, the energy efficiency was 3.54 times higher than the 8-b INT weight with similar accuracy. During training, using 4-b LOGQ weight to reach the same accuracy increases epoch compared with using only 8-b INT weight, but consequentially saves 68.7% in relative total energy. Furthermore, it achieves 599-kb/mm2 memory density.</description></item><item><title>Ayaka: A Versatile Transformer Accelerator With Low-Rank Estimation and Heterogeneous Dataflow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10530252</link><description>Transformer model has demonstrated outstanding performance in the field of artificial intelligence. However, its remarkable performance comes at the cost of substantial computational complexity, posing limitations on deploying transformers from cloud to edge due to power and throughput constraints. There are two main challenges in designing a transformer accelerator for practical tasks. First, a transformer has inconsistent bottlenecks due to input length changes: for short inputs, such as using vision transformer (ViT) for ImageNet or bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) for general language understanding evaluation (GLUE), the linear layer of the model becomes the computational bottleneck. In contrast, for long inputs, such as high-resolution images or long-text tasks, attention computation becomes the bottleneck. Second, even for a given input length, different layers in the model exhibit various computational characteristics and workloads, such as matrix sizes and data reuse strategies. This article introduces Ayaka, a versatile transformer accelerator designed to address these issues. Ayaka uses a cross-layer sparse prediction approach based on random projection (RP), enabling simultaneous sparsification of attention computation and linear layers, thereby enhancing throughput for various bottlenecks for different input lengths. Furthermore, Ayaka optimizes the sparse attention computation by leveraging the input translation invariance of softmax. In addition, Ayaka features a heterogeneous dataflow processing element (HDPE) design, dynamically adjusting stationary matrix operands based on the current computation to maximize on-chip data reuse and reduce memory footprint. With these features, Ayaka is so far the first accelerator that accelerates the whole attention layer. Evaluation of 12 typical models and tasks shows that it achieves a peak energy efficiency of 49.7 TOPS/W, which is 1.20&#8211; $258.9{\times }$  higher than the state-of-the-art works.</description></item><item><title>A 73.8k-Inference/mJ SVM Learning Accelerator for Brain Pattern Recognition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559984</link><description>Machine learning (ML) has been widely adopted in neural signal processing and support vector machine (SVM) stands out for its efficacy given limited training data.

Kernel transformation reduces the processing element (PE) array&#8217;s hardware complexity by 42%. Sparsity-aware skipping eliminates redundant computations, leading to latency reduction. The design space of the PE array is explored to minimize the hardware cost. Data scheduling is applied to improve the PE utilization. Overall, the processing latency for the PE array is reduced by 96%. For PE array implementation, the area of the data exchanger is reduced by 93% by utilizing the chained interconnect.

Built upon existing phased arrays, this scheme integrates an auxiliary-path vector modulator (VM) into each antenna element, which in turn, forms an interference-canceling beam. By spatially combining the array factors (AFs) of the main beam and the interference-canceling beam, a deep spatial notch is created while ensuring minimal main-beam power degradation. Unlike the conventional zero-forcing method that requires matrix inversion in digital for spatial notch creation, our scheme enables the computation of antenna weights in analog, significantly reducing the computational cost and latency. Leveraging this new notch steering scheme, we develop a 28-GHz four-element fully connected (FC) hybrid beamforming TX array using the GlobalFoundries 45-nm CMOS Silicon-on-Insulator (SOI) process. It is capable of simultaneously transmitting two independent, wideband data streams (DSs) in the same polarization toward two directions. In probing-based measurements, each TX channel delivers 19.7-dBm OP1 dB, 20.4-dBm  ${P} {_{\text {SAT}}}$ , and 30.6% peak power-added efficiency (PAE) at 29 GHz, demonstrating state-of-the-art TX linearity and efficiency. In over-the-air (OTA) measurements, the packaged TX array achieves 29.8-dBm EIRP1 dB and is able to steer a spatial notch outside the &#8722;10-dB beamwidth of the main beam, with a notch depth of &gt;35 dB and a main-beam power degradation of &lt; 0.8 dB. Moreover, in spatial multiplexing demonstrations, the TX array is capable of transmitting a 400-MHz 64-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) signal to the intended receiver (RX) in the first DS, while suppressing the co-channel continuous-wave or wideband modulated interference created by the second DS with a high SINR.</description></item><item><title>A Compact Millimeter-Wave Reconfigurable Dual-Band LNA With Image-Rejection in 28-nm Bulk CMOS for 5G Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10536110</link><description>This article presents a reconfigurable dual-band low noise amplifier (LNA) for 5G millimeter-wave (mmWave) applications in the TSMC 28-nm bulk CMOS process. The reconfigurable LNA is based on a two-stage amplifier design with switchable triple-coupled transformer and capacitor technologies applied to the inter-stage and output matching networks. The switchable triple-coupled transformer can change the self-inductance of the transformer coils by tuning the magnetic flux entering the coils. To suppress the image frequency interference, magnetic&#8211;electric hybrid coupling is integrated into the inter-stage matching network, which introduces a transmission zero, resulting in a high image rejection ratio. The measured result shows that the low band has a peak gain of 18.1 dB with a 3-dB bandwidth of 23.8&#8211;33.5 GHz, and the high band has a peak gain of 18.9 dB with a 3-dB bandwidth of 34.4&#8211;41.4 GHz. The image rejection ratio is better than 32.7 dBc with an intermediate frequency of 8 GHz. The measured NF is better than 3.5 dB at both bands. The IP1dB is -19 to -15.1/-18.5 to -15.2 dBm in the low/high band. The fabricated LNA has a very compact core size of 0.09 mm2, and the total power consumption is only 14 mW.</description></item><item><title>Design and Analysis of a Fractional Frequency Synthesizer With &lt;90-fs Jitter and &lt;&#8211;103-dBc Spurious Tones Using Digital Spur Cancellation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531278</link><description>In this article, we describe an advanced multi-output fractional frequency synthesizer (FFS) featuring an innovative digital spur cancellation technique.

To address the issues of increased power consumption and susceptibility to noise due to reduced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the use of data bus inversion (DBI) is implemented and investigated. By adopting the DBI technique in PAM-4 signaling, the driver power and supply fluctuations can be mitigated while preserving the pin overhead of one for the PAM-4-modulated DBI flag. On every single channel of the TX, the addition of a capacitive-coupled feed-forward equalizer (CC-FFE) is utilized to alleviate inter-symbol interference (ISI) effects. In addition, a reference impedance (ZQ) calibration method enabling the precise adjustment of ZQ values using variation-mitigated on-chip resistors is proposed. By utilizing the proposed ZQ calibration method, the driver&#8217;s output impedance can be precisely adjusted under practical operating conditions while maintaining the off-chip cost for one reference resistor. The single-channel TX operates at data rates of up to 38 Gb/s while consuming 26.16 mW of power, which corresponds to a calculated energy efficiency of 0.688 pJ/bit. A 16.3% power dissipation reduction was measured in the drivers as a result of the PAM-4 DBI.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Integrated Nine-Ratio Switched-Capacitor Converter With Overlapped-Conversion-Ratio Modulation for IoT Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10549516</link><description>This article presents a fully integrated step-down switched-capacitor (SC) converter with nine voltage conversion ratios (VCRs) that regulates an output load voltage ( $V_{\text {OUT}}$ ) of 0.1&#8211;3.67 V with an input voltage of 2.5&#8211;5 V.

The NCGFB design technique enables to cancel parasitic capacitances of cables and electrodes at the IA input in order to boost the input impedance. The negative capacitance is generated through feedback loops containing digitally programmable capacitor banks that can compensate for an extra input capacitance of up to 100 pF. A chopping technique is also introduced to enhance the noise performance of NCGFB IAs with input impedance boosting. The proposed amplifier is based on the capacitively-coupled IA (CCIA) architecture with additional circuit-level innovations to increase input impedance and improve noise performance. Two NCGFB loops have been added to further boost the input impedance. These NCGFB loops include a low-pass filter (LPF) to suppress ripples from the chopping prior to feeding the signal back to nodes at which capacitances are cancelled. We present an analysis to verify the stability of the loops as well as their effects on boosting the input impedance. The full symmetry of the NCGFB loops enables the use of identical capacitor banks to maintain a high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR).

FHSs are attached to the magnetic recording heads in modern hard disk drives (HDDs) to monitor the head-disk distance known as &#8220;fly height&#8221; by measuring the FHS resistance variation. The magnitude of the sensor signal serves as a measure of the proximity between the head and the disk surface which must accurately be controlled to minimize the fly height, thereby increasing the storage capacity of HDDs. The proposed interface includes two parts: 1) a dual-mode precise bias circuit that accurately provides a differential bias with a programmable common-mode voltage to the FHS in both voltage (V) and current (I) modes without requiring any calibrations, as well as featuring fast and smooth transient response, 2) front-end gain stages that create two separate signal paths with low- and high-frequency responses, called LF and HF blocks, utilized for controlling the fly height and mapping the roughness of the disk surface, respectively. The proposed bias circuit demonstrates high-impedance loading behavior on the sensor terminals in both V- and I- modes to have a unity signal gain at the sensor port and deliver it to the front-end amplifiers, resulting in an improvement of the overall noise performance of the interface. In addition, the bias noise power at the output of the LF block is suppressed to the extent of one order of magnitude thanks to deploying a noise cancellation technique. A low-noise and wide-bandwidth front-end is implemented for the HF block that eliminates the need for configuring the bias loop for having a low cutoff frequency, resulting in a reliable design with reduced complexity. Additionally, degenerated differential pairs with resistive loads, split tail currents, and Caprio&#8217;s quad offering low gain variation over the temperature and process are implemented as the front-end gain stages.

Different from the traditional TCR-based PA designs that focus solely on broadband load-pull matching or TCR transimpedance, the intrinsic design knowledge of the proposed method utilizes the mechanism of joint-design between PA active circuits and TCR networks. By combining this knowledge with an optimization-oriented genetic algorithm (GA), an initial TCR solution that achieves low-ripple and broadband PA output response can be rapidly synthesized, in the sense that the superior initial population, not as random as that in traditional GA, can improve the GA convergence and reduce the algorithm iterations. Simulated results show that this work achieves about 4 times speed improvement in TCR synthesis than the traditional GA. The proposed method can efficiently synthesize the optimal TCR parameters for multi-stage PA to obtain the user-defined output power within a target bandwidth. As a proof of this work, a cascode-based PA for FMCW radar application is designed in 110-nm CMOS process, aiming to realize a peak 14-dBm output power and 50% 1-dB fractional bandwidth (FBW). The measured PA large-signal performance versus frequency shows a wide 1-dB BW for  ${P} {_{\text {sat}}}$  over 8.5-14.5 GHz (52.2% FBW) with 15.7-dBm peak value and 27% peak PAEmax at 11.5 GHz, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed broadband synthesis mothod for PAs.</description></item><item><title>An 8-MS/s 16-bit SAR ADC With Symmetric Complementary Switching and Split Passive Reference Segmentation in 180-nm Process</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634568</link><description>This paper presents an efficient 8-MS/s 16-bit successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with the proposed symmetric complementary switching (SCS) and split passive reference segmentation (SPRS). Conventionally, improving the SAR ADC speed compromises the signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and energy efficiency due to the high precision requirement and the sequential bit-cycling. In this design, the proposed SCS scheme reduces the parasitic capacitance in the sampling path and the settling error of the capacitive digital-to-analog converter (CDAC) with low SNDR and hardware penalties. In addition, to reduce reference ripples, active reference buffers generally consume high power while the passive methods may degrade the SNDR or occupy large areas. To efficiently reduce reference settling errors, an area-efficient SPRS is developed, which suppresses the reference settling error through the split reference segmentation. The prototype chip is fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process and occupies an area of 0.57 mm2. Measurements show the ADC achieves a peak SNDR of 89.2 dB at 8 MS/s with a 9.5-mW power consumption. The Schreier-figure-of-merit (FoM) is 175.4 dB.</description></item><item><title>A Time-to-Voltage Converter-Based MPPT With 440 &#956;s Online Tracking Time, 99.7% Tracking Efficiency for a Battery-Less Harvesting Front-End With Cold-Startup and Over-Voltage Protection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10621014</link><description>This paper introduces a time-to-voltage converter-based maximum power point tracking (TVCB-MPPT) for harvesting photovoltaic energy into a super-capacitor using a single solar cell. In the proposed design, a time-to-voltage converter is used to achieve a fast and accurate tracking of the maximum power point (MPP) without using a time-averaging/time-integrating function as used in the conventional time-based MPPT design. Moreover, with the continuous monitoring of the MPP, the proposed converter responds immediately and maximizes the extracted energy under varying irradiance conditions as compared to the conventional intermittent MPPT topologies. The addition of the cold-start operation and the over-voltage protection increase the robustness and energy-autonomy of the overall system. The proposed TVCB-MPPT converter is fabricated in a 180 nm CMOS process. In the measured result, a fast online MPP tracking time of  $440~\mu $ s is observed with an initial tracking time of 4.8 ms. It also shows a peak tracking efficiency of 99.7% with a power conversion efficiency &gt;87% in the entire input power range.</description></item><item><title>A Duty-Cycle-Error-Immune Reference Frequency Doubling Technique for Fractional-N Digital PLLs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654370</link><description>Increasing a PLL&#8217;s reference frequency offers significant performance advantages, but doing so by increasing the PLL&#8217;s crystal oscillator frequency is not a viable option in many applications. Instead, a frequency doubler can be used to derive a reference signal with twice the frequency of the crystal oscillator, but conventional PLLs are highly sensitive to the crystal oscillator&#8217;s duty cycle error in such cases. Prior solutions to this problem involve calibration techniques which impose convergence speed versus accuracy tradeoffs. In contrast, this paper proposes a system modification which makes a PLL immune to such duty cycle errors without the need for calibration. The technique is presented and analyzed in the context of a delta-sigma frequency-to-digital converter ( $\Delta \Sigma $ -FDC) based PLL. Analysis and behavioral simulations with nonideal circuit parameters show that the worst-case convergence time is at least 10 times faster than that of the prior techniques. Additionally, the proposed  $\Delta \Sigma $ -FDC includes other modifications which improve its performance relative to comparable prior  $\Delta \Sigma $ -FDCs.</description></item><item><title>A 28-/60-GHz Dual-Band Receiver Front-End With Sideband-Selection Technique in 65-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620212</link><description>This article presents a dual-band receiver front-end based on a reconfigurable Hartley architecture with double frequency conversion for millimeter-wave wireless communication. By controlling working states of band-select switches, the receiver is able to reach different RF bands without increasing or altering local-oscillator (LO) and intermediate-frequency bands. To reduce power consumption and save chip area, RF quadrature mixers are co-designed with the last stage of a dual-band low-noise amplifier and reuse its dc current. In addition, a self-mixing frequency tripler with a transformer-based compact hybrid is developed to multiply an input LO and provide quadrature LO signals for the RF mixers. The prototype receiver is demonstrated in a 65 nm CMOS process. Measurement results show that the receiver successfully covers two frequency bands of 24.6~28 GHz and 55.6~60 GHz, and the corresponding peak conversion gains are up to 24.5 dB and 26.3 dB, respectively. In these two bands, the minimum single-sideband noise figures are 7.5 and 7.8 dB. The tested image-rejection ratio of the dual-band receiver is better than 30 dB in both 26.5~30.0 GHz and 57.5~60.5 GHz bands. Besides, the receiver also demonstrates its capability of supporting up to 256QAM modulation and 3.2-Gb/s data-rate transmission.</description></item><item><title>A Balanced CMOS Compatible Ternary Memristor-NMOS Logic Family and Its Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638758</link><description>Balanced ternary digital logic circuits based on memristors and MOSFET devices are introduced. First, balanced ternary minimum gate TMIN, maximum gate TMAX and ternary inverters are designed and verified by simulation. Next, logic circuits such as ternary encoders, decoders and multiplexers are designed using these three basic gates. For further validation, a ternary 3&#8211;1 encoder was hardware-implemented successfully using in-house fabricated memristors and MOS transistors. Two different design approaches, namely the decoder-based method and the multiplexer-based method are introduced and applied to realize combinational logic circuits such as balanced ternary half-adder, multiplier, and numerical comparator. We simulate the circuits using 50nm CMOS technology parameters and BSIM models and present comparisons and analyses of the two design methods in view of the power consumption and component device counts, which can guide subsequent research and development of integrated multi-valued logic circuits. The decoder-based method has advantages both in terms of component numbers and power consumption, but the multiplexer-based method has the advantages of being based on a simple operating principle and ease of implementation.</description></item><item><title>Hardware-Efficient SoftMax Architecture With Bit-Wise Exponentiation and Reciprocal Calculation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10640134</link><description>The SoftMax function is one of the activation functions used in deep neural networks (DNN) to normalize input values to the range of (0,1). With the advent of DNN models including the Transformer, operations utilizing SoftMax have gained significant attention, and the efficient hardware implementation of such operations has become a prominent issue in hardware realization. Implementing SoftMax often involves exponential and division operations, which can be a significant bottleneck in terms of hardware cost and performance. Various efforts have been made to address this challenge, and this paper introduces a novel approach to efficiently implement SoftMax. In most previous works, the maximum input value is subtracted from all the input values to ensure numerical stability. In the proposed approach, the maximum value is replaced with a different value to reduce the hardware complexity with ensuring numerical stability. Additionally, in exponential operations, simple Look-Up Tables (LUTs) with only one entry each are used for bit-wise calculations, and the reciprocal of the total exponential sum is computed to replace division with multiplication. Applying the proposed methods reduces the computational complexity significantly compared to the previous log-sum-exp approach. As a result, the proposed 8-bit SoftMax accelerator achieves a high operating frequency of 3.12GHz and a high throughput of 25G inputs/s. It also improves area efficiency and power consumption by at least 2 times. From an accuracy perspective, furthermore, it is associated with similar or even better accuracy compared to previous works.</description></item><item><title>Process-Variation-Aware In-Memory Computation With Improved Linearity Using On-Chip Configurable Current-Steering Thermometric DAC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10621041</link><description>The in-memory computation (IMC) is a potential technique to improve the speed and energy efficiency of data-intensive designs. However, the scalability of IMC to large systems is hindered by the non-linearities of analog multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations and process variation, which impacts the precision of high bit-width MAC operations. In this paper, we present an IMC architecture that is capable of performing multi-bit MAC operations with improved speed, linearity, and computational accuracy. To improve the speed/linearity of the IMC-MAC operations, the image and weight data are applied by using the pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) and thermometric techniques, respectively. Although the PAM technique improves the speed of the IMC-MAC operations, it has linearity issues that need to be addressed. Based on the detailed linearity analysis of the IMC-MAC circuit, we proposed two approaches to improve the linearity and the signal margin (SM) of the IMC architecture. The proposed configurable current steering thermometric digital-to-analog converter (CST-DAC) array is employed to provide the PAM signals with various dynamic ranges and non-linear gaps that are required to improve the linearity/SM. The proposed combined PAM and thermometric IMC (PT-IMC) architecture is designed and fabricated in the TSMC 180-nm CMOS process. The post-silicon calibration of the design point mitigates the process-variation issues and provides the maximum SM (close to the simulation results). Furthermore, the proposed PT-IMC architecture performs MNIST/CIFAR-10 data set classification with an accuracy of 98%/88%. In addition, the PT-IMC architecture achieves a peak throughput of 12.41 GOPS, a normalized energy efficiency of 30.64 TOPS/W, a normalized figure-of-merit (FOM) of 3039, a loss in the SM of 8.3% with respect to the ideal SM, and a computational error of 0.41%.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Scaled E-Tree-Based SRAM Design and Optimization With Interconnect Focus</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638740</link><description>SRAM performance is highly dominated by interconnects as technology scales down because of the significant parasitic resistance and capacitance in the interconnect.

Accordingly, a coarse-grained reconfigurable array (CGRA) is considered the most effective architecture for achieving high speed, low power, and high flexibility for implementing LWC algorithms. However, existing CGRA designs for cryptography focus only on improvements to outdated 8/32-bit algorithms, suffer from large area requirements, and have long compilation times. To address these issues, this paper proposes a new CGRA-based accelerator named LiCryptor to support various 8/32/64-bit LWC algorithms with high speed and small area. Three innovative ideas are proposed to enable LiCryptor to achieve these goals: a compact multi-grained processing element array (M-PEA), a shared 8/32/64-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and an assembly-like inline directive (AID) mapping method. The LiCryptor has been successfully implemented and verified on the Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. Real-time performance evaluation across various LWC algorithms on FPGA shows that LiCryptor is 1.33 to 4 times better in execution time and 3.4 to 153 times better in power-delay products (PDP) compared to today&#8217;s most powerful CPUs. Notably, evaluation of AID mapping on the ARM Cortex-A53 CPU of the ZCU102 FPGA shows that its compilation time is less than 1.5 ms for most LWC algorithms, at least 2,333 times faster than CFG mapping in current CGRAs. Moreover, experimental results on 45nm ASIC technology show that the LiCryptor significantly outperforms existing CGRAs and other reconfigurable designs in terms of throughput and area efficiency.</description></item><item><title>A Balanced Sparse Matrix Convolution Accelerator for Efficient CNN Training</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10612221</link><description>Sparse Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) training is well known to be time-consuming due to significant off-chip memory traffic. To effectively deploy sparse training, existing accelerators store matrices in a compressed format to eliminate memory accesses for zeros; hence, accelerators are designed to process compressed matrices to avoid zero computations. We have observed that the compression rate is greatly affected by the sparsity in the matrices with different formats. Given the varying levels of sparsity in activations, weights, errors, and gradients matrices throughout the sparse training process, it becomes impractical to achieve consistently high compression rates using a singular compression method for the entire duration of the training. Moreover, random zeros in the matrices result in irregular computation patterns, further increasing execution time. To address these issues, we propose a balanced sparse matrix convolution accelerator design for efficient CNN training. Specifically, a dual matrix compression technique is developed that seamlessly combines two widely used sparse matrix compression formats with a control algorithm for lower memory traffic during training. Based on this compression technique, a two-level workload balancing technique is then designed to further reduce the execution time and energy consumption. Finally, an accelerator is implemented to support the proposed techniques. The cycle-accurate simulation results show that the proposed accelerator reduces the execution time by 34% and the energy consumption by 24% on average compared to existing sparse training accelerators.</description></item><item><title>Layer-Wise Mixed-Modes CNN Processing Architecture With Double-Stationary Dataflow and Dimension-Reshape Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620270</link><description>With the development of convolutional neural networks (CNN) across various domains, the growth in network structure complexity and computational load has increasingly become a research focus in the deployment of neural networks. The key to current research on neural network accelerators lies in striking a balance between computational accuracy and energy efficiency. This paper proposes a software-hardware co-design to strike the balance for CNN edge applications. On the hardware side, a 3-dimensional tensor engine (3D-TE), achieved with reconfigurable Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), is introduced for efficient convolution computation. We optimize the CNN dataflow on 3D-TE using a dimension reshaping method for feature maps rearrangement, and a double stationary dataflow scheduling to reduce memory access. This paper adopts a configurable approximate multiplier design based on Boolean Matrix Factorization (BMF) based logic synthesis applied in the architecture of TPU. The proposed 3D-TE, characterized by its configurable precision, enables the TPUs to dynamically adapt the bitwidth of features and weights in response to varying precision requirements. On the software side, a hessian-guided layer precision mapping is adopted to reduce unnecessary computational overhead, and a progressive re-training approach is proposed to enable a better approximation configuration and higher power reduction. Fabricated on 28-nm CMOS, this work achieves an optimized energy efficiency of 14.9 TOPS/W and 12.1 TOPS/W for ResNet56 and MobileNetV2 respectively, with 0.6V supply voltage and 150MHz clock frequency, representing an improvement of  $1.33\times \sim 8.28\times $  over the state-of-the-art works.</description></item><item><title>Constant Power-Constant Voltage Battery Charging Based on a Loss-Free Resistor Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638741</link><description>A constant power (CP)-constant voltage (CV) protocol for battery charging is implemented in a conventional boost converter with output filter (BOF) by imposing loss-free resistor (LFR) behavior during the CP phase. To compare on equal basis the performance of the new CP-CV technique with the classical constant current (CC)&#8211;CV protocol, the latter is also implemented in the same power stage. The CC phase in BOF is attained by imposing a G-gyrator of type II behavior to the converter. A versatile controller uses the same voltage regulation loop for both protocols during the CV phase and a slightly different loop for the CP and CC phases. The latter loop is based in both CP and CC phases on the sliding-mode control (SMC) of the input inductor current of BOF, which in steady-state is made proportional to the input voltage in the LFR case or to the output voltage in the gyrator implementation. To compensate for the slow variations of the battery voltage during the CC phase, a proportional-integral (PI) current regulator has been added in the gyrator realization. The comparison of the corresponding experimental results shows identical behavior in both approaches in the measured waveforms, component stress, efficiency and external temperature. The simplicity of the CP-CV implementation based on LFR allows the extension of the proposed protocol to other hard-switching converters.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Impedance Matching System With Fast Optimization Control Algorithm for Wireless Power Transfer via Magnetic Coupling Resonance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634540</link><description>For a magnetic coupling resonant wireless power transfer (MCR-WPT) system, the most challenging design issue is to maintain the reasonable transfer efficiency and the output power, especially over varying transmitting distances. To address this issue, this study proposes an adaptive impedance matching (AIM) system with a fast optimization control algorithm for the MCR-WPT system. By dynamically monitoring system input impedance variations at a given frequency, the matching system can be automatically activated. The matching precision is enabled by combining an amplitude-phase measurement circuit, a Pi-type impedance matching (IM) network, and the local optimization algorithm. Experimental comparisons show a significant improvement in the transfer efficiency. The maximum improvement is over 32.6%. The results also show that the local optimization algorithm helps the MCR-WPT system to effectively overcome the efficiency challenges caused by parasitic parameters, resulting in a maximum improvement of 19.8%. The stability of the output power is also significantly improved, with a 27.8% reduction in oscillation amplitude compared to the scenario without the local optimization algorithm, and a 60.0% reduction compared to the scenario without the IM network. The output power range (1.55 - 2.21 W) could meet the power requirements of most implantable medical devices. Moreover, this system adopts a control algorithm of tracking the theoretically optimal matching solution through Microcontroller Unit (MCU) computation, leading to a notable enhancement in matching accuracy.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive On-Off-Delay Compensation Scheme Based on Dead-Time and Rectified-Current Sampling for Ampere-Current-Level Series-Series Wireless Power Receivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634544</link><description>This article presents an adaptive on-off-delay compensation scheme for Ampere-current-level series-series (SS) wireless power receivers (RXs) to enhance both the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and the power delivering capability (PDC). The proposed off-delay compensation is realized by injecting an adaptive offset which is adjusted by sampling the rectified current. The proposed on-delay compensation is realized by inserting adaptive delays which are adjusted by sampling the dead time of the active full-wave rectifier. The proposed scheme was applied in a dual-mode resonant regulating rectifier which was fabricated in 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS technology, and the regulated output voltage was set to 3.3 V. Measurement results demonstrated that the proposed scheme can effectively compensate for the on-off-delay as the RX input AC current varies from 0.7 to 2 A, corresponding to the coil distance varies from 26 to 42 mm. A measured peak PCE of 92.93% was achieved when the load current and coil distance were 0.945 A and 38 mm, respectively. Compared to the cases without delay compensation, the measured RX PDC increased from 495 mW to 1435.5 mW when the coil distance was 26 mm. Additionally, the measured PDC increased from 2557.5 mW to 4075.5 mW when the coil distance was 42 mm.</description></item><item><title>Modular Expansion Method for Wireless Power Transfer Systems With Arbitrary Topologies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10652249</link><description>Modular parallel inverter technology can enhance the power level and redundancy of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, contributing to standardized production. It serves as an effective method for realizing high-power systems. However, inappropriate selection of compensation components can negatively affect the system&#8217;s efficiency, power factor, and the flexibility of modularization. This paper analyzes two key properties of modular-parallel-inverter WPT (MPI-WPT) systems: module number flexibility and modular deviation suppression. Firstly, to assess the modular deviation suppression of the system, its definition and calculation method are provided. Secondly, the expansion condition to achieve modular flexibility is examined, highlighting that the modular system needs to be a fully resonant system. Subsequently, an expansion design methodology from a single WPT system to an MPI-WPT system is proposed, ensuring the preservation of the original properties of the system during its extension. Finally, the parallel characteristics of MPI-WPT systems were experimentally verified.</description></item><item><title>A Novel CHB-Based Photovoltaic Grid-Tied System Integration of Centralized Energy Storage and Its Power Security Domain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10623759</link><description>Due to differences of solar irradiance, ambient temperatures, or inconsistent degradation of photovoltaic (PV) modules, the unbalanced output power between cascaded H-bridge (CHB) legs will lead to the unbalanced or even distorted grid currents between three phases.

The simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed CHB-PV/ES scheme.</description></item><item><title>Impedance Matching Through a Reconfigurable Relay Coil Achieving Maximum Wireless Power Transfer Under Variations of Coupling Coefficient and Load Resistance</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614874</link><description>In this work, a 6.78 MHz three-coil wireless power transfer (WPT) system was presented, which consists of a transmitter (TX) coil, a reconfigurable relay coil (RRC), and a receiver (RX) coil. We analytically derived the critical coupling boundary and impedance matching (IM) condition in the strong-coupling regime for the first time. Under the variation of either coupling coefficient  $\boldsymbol {k}$  or load resistance  $\boldsymbol {R}_{\text {L}}$ , we proposed to achieve the IM condition on both TX and RX sides by adjusting the RRC&#8217;s inductance through electronically selecting its constituting loops. This eliminates the coupling tuning related with the mechanical position change. To obtain the optimum loop inductance in the RRC, we simply measured the voltage and current on the TX side without requiring information of  $\boldsymbol {k}$  or  $\boldsymbol { R}_{\text {L}}$ . This eliminates the RX-to-TX communication link. We implemented a prototype WPT system by including a class-D power amplifier (PA) and a rectifier, and the effectiveness of IM was verified under variations of  $\boldsymbol {k}$  and  $\boldsymbol {R}_{\text {L}}$ . Compared with the system without IM, the transmission ratio  $\boldsymbol { S}_{{21}}$  and load power  $\boldsymbol {P}_{\text {Load}}$  were respectively increased from 66.5 % to 77.9 % and 4.2 W to 10.2 W at  $\boldsymbol {k} = 0.15$  and  $\boldsymbol {R}_{\text {L}} = 20~\Omega $ . Furthermore, the performance improvement of our system for the wireless charging of multiple RX coils was demonstrated.</description></item><item><title>Model-Independent Observer-Based Critically Damped Terminal Voltage Stabilization for Single Machine Infinite Bus Systems via High-Order Pole-Zero Cancellation Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637471</link><description>The proposed cascade-type feedback system stabilizes the terminal voltage of single machine infinite bus (SMIB) systems using two measurements: power angle and terminal voltage. The resultant control law only requires the nominal system parameters of the SMIB, and the observer removes any model dependence. This paper provides several contributions. First, the high-order pole-zero cancellation (PZC) technique constructs the observer to estimate the time derivatives of the terminal voltage and power angle measurements without any SMIB model information. Second, the high-order PZC technique enables the outer loop to estimate the desired power angle reference along the critically damped dynamics for the terminal voltage. Third, the observer-based proportional-double integral-derivative control law for the inner loop exponentially stabilizes the power angle error by reducing the closed-loop order to 2 through the high-order PZC technique. A MATLAB/Simulink implementation of the proposed cascade-type feedback system validates the effectiveness of the proposed solution.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid-Bridge-Based Dual-Active-Bridge Converter With an Asymmetric Active-Neutral-Point-Clamped Three-Level Bridge</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10634536</link><description>Hybrid-bridge based dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter comprised of three-level (3L) and two-level (2L) full-bridge (FB) is promising to be a good candidate for medium voltage DC (MVDC) grids. By applying a corresponding modulation strategy proposed in this paper with multiple working patterns, a wide voltage conversion gain can be obtained. However, given that the conventional neutral-point-clamped (NPC) DAB converter has potential risk losing the control of the voltage conversion gain in backward and forward modes, an asymmetric active-neutral-clamped (A-ANPC) 3L structure is employed in the proposed converter to overcome this issue. Afterwards, to ensure a smooth working pattern transition, a simplified control strategy is proposed. The backflow power remains constant regardless of working conditions, and the zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) can be achieved for all power switches under the proposed modulation strategy. The operation principle, characteristics, and performances of the proposed converter are analyzed in detail and experimentally verified.</description></item><item><title>An RRAM-Based Hierarchical Computing-in-Memory Architecture With Synchronous Parallelism for 3-D Point Cloud Recognition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10520717</link><description>Point clouds have important applications, such as computer vision, autonomous driving, and robotics.

In this topology, a crude user-provided calibration signal is applied and alternatively sampled by all the interleaved channels. Based on the digitized codes of the calibration signal, which is independent of the input signal, multiple estimation algorithms could be used to extract these mismatches. To avoid interrupting the normal signal conversion operation, an extra sub-ADC channel is employed to cycle through and substitute for the interleaved channels to sample the analog input. The FPGA-based hardware implementation results show that the proposed calibration architecture combined with a statistics-based timing skew estimation method, successfully compensates the timing skew mismatch, with an input of DC voltage, single tone near Nyquist and random signal, respectively. Compared with traditional reference-ADC-based calibration schemes, except for the signal-independent characteristic, the proposed scheme avoids time-variant input impedance problem and achieves constant convergence time regardless of the inputs.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-GHz Inverter-Based ASDM With Distortion Cancellation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531049</link><description>This brief proposes and demonstrates an asynchronous sigma-delta modulator (ASDM) which is based entirely on pseudo-digital inverters.

Moreover, to ensure the safe tracking control for constrained uncertain robotic systems, a minimum energy quadratic program (QP) with Lyapunov-like conditions is constructed as constraints on nominal control inputs, and the safe tracking controllers of robotic systems are then obtained by solving the minimum energy QP. Consequently, the safety and tracking performances of constrained uncertain robotic systems can be guaranteed simultaneously.

Compared to standard SNNs, liquid state machine (LSM), the spiking variant of reservoir computing, exhibits advantages in image classification, and are especially more promising in speech recognition. However, LSM-based neuromorphic processors suffer from weight storage overhead in resource-constrained edge applications. To address this, we propose ghost reservoir: a memory-efficient LSM based neuromorphic processor enabling on-chip spike-time-dependent plasticity-based backpropagation (BP-STDP) learning. For the LSM reservoir layer, we adopt a stateless-neuron model and an on-the-fly weight re-generation scheme to avoid the storages for both membrane potentials and weights. For the readout learning layer, a stochastic weight update approach is implemented to reduce the memory bit-width. These techniques contribute to an aggregate of a 482.5 KB on-chip memory reduction on the FPGA prototype. Implemented on the very-low-cost Xilinx Zynq-7010 device, our prototype achieved real-time processing, demonstrated comparably high on-chip learning accuracies of 94.93%, 84.65%, and 92% on the MNIST, N-MNIST, and FSDD datasets, respectively. These experimental results indicate that our LSM-based lightweight neuromorphic design is quite suitable for speech and visual recognition tasks in many resource-constrained edge intelligent applications.</description></item><item><title>A Contention-Free Wordline Supporting Circuit for High Wordline Resistance in Sub-10-nm SRAM Designs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10542405</link><description>A contention-free wordline supporting (CFWLS) circuit is proposed for SRAM in sub-10 nm technologies. The CFWLS resolves the problem of performance degradation caused by significant RC delays with increasing wordline interconnect resistance. A low-skewed sensing inverter utilizes a diode-connected PMOS to detect the wordline rising transition with negligible contention. A supporting PMOS supplies charge to the end of the wordline. By using a replica signal of the wordline enable (WLENt), sufficient charge can be supplied during the entire evaluation phase. The proposed CFWLS has a noise-tolerant characteristic because it complements the floating node by using a pull-up path in the sensing inverter. The WL rising time is improved by 48-57% in post-layout simulation compared to the conventional SRAM without a supporting circuit. The clock-to-bitline (half-VDD) delay is also improved by 20%, while the energy and area overheads of CFWLS are only 7% and 1.7%, respectively. In the test-chip measurements, the read delay for a pass is improved by 180 ps (16%) in sub-3 nm technologies.</description></item><item><title>A Novel 5L Boosting Inverter With Reduced Spike Current</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475701</link><description>This brief introduces a novel five-level inverter with a single DC source that uses only seven power switches and one capacitor.

Improved by the traditional VD power stage, the dual-output DC voltages are achieved by adding a power transistor. Thanks to the proposed power stage topology, the dual-output DC voltages realize full-wave rectification charging and a voltage conversion ratio (VCR) greater than 1 can be realized, which benefits the robustness of the WPT system under the loosely coupled link. The SPFM control is proposed to regulate the dual-output voltages sequentially.

The power flow in ESS can be separated into a low-frequency component due to daily interaction between average generation and consumption patterns, and a high-frequency component due to radical increase/decrease in generation/load demand. The former can be catered by utilizing high energy density ESS like a battery, whereas the latter necessitate fast response ESS like a supercapacitor. This envisages the requirement of a Hybrid ESS (HESS) consisting of a battery and a supercapacitor.

In this regard, a novel detection technique based on the multiplicative watermarking and Luenberger observer is developed to identify covert attacks applied to the system. In the presented detection strategy, a special watermark generator filter produces a dummy signal on the original signal transmitted through the insecure communication channels. In addition, there is a watermark equalization filter at the end of the communication channel, which cancels out the impact of the watermark signal, resulting in the recovery of the original signal. A PI controller tuned by the deep reinforcement learning algorithm and dependent on the Luenberger observer is utilized as the secondary frequency control strategy to mitigate the impacts of the convert attacks. The OPAL-RT real-time emulator-based results show the proposed defense strategy successfully detects and mitigates the covert attacks imposed on the system.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Single-Switch High-Gain DC&#8211;DC Converter With Active Switched Inductor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10520660</link><description>This brief presents a non-isolated, novel single-switch high-gain DC-DC converter with an active switched inductor (NSSHG-ASI) designed for fuel-cell and photovoltaic (PV) powered systems.

The embedding layers with large memory capacity requirement and high bandwidth demand have been identified as the bottleneck of personalized recommendation inference. To mitigate the memory bandwidth bottleneck, near-memory processing (NMP) would be an effective solution which utilizes the through-silicon via (TSV) bandwidth within 3D-stacked DRAMs. However, existing NMP architectures suffer from the limited memory bandwidth caused by hard-to-scale TSVs. To overcome this obstacle, integrating the compute-logic near memory banks becomes a promising but challenging solution, since large memory capacity requirement limits the use of 3D-stacked DRAMs and irregular memory accesses lead to poor data locality, heavy TSV data traffic and low bank-level bandwidth utilization. To address this problem, we propose RecPIM, the first in-memory processing system for personalized recommendation inference using near-bank architecture based on 3D-stacked memory. From the hardware perspective, we introduce a heterogeneous memory system combined with 3D-stacked DRAM and DIMMs to accommodate large embedding tables and provide high bandwidth. By integrating processing logic units near memory banks on DRAM dies, our architecture can exploit the enormous bank-level bandwidth which is much higher than TSV bandwidth. Then, we integrate a small scratchpad memory to exploit the unique data reusability of DL-based personalized recommendation systems. Furthermore, we adopt a unidirectional data communication scheme to avoid additional cross-vault data transfer. From the software perspective, we present a customized programming model to facilitate memory management and task offloading. To reduce the data communication through TSVs and enhance the utilization of bank-level bandwidth, we develop an efficient data mapping scheme by partitioning the vector into smaller subvectors. Experimental results show that RecPIM achieves up to  $2.58\times $  speedup and 49.8% energy saving for data movement over the state-of-the-art NMP solution.</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency Power Obfuscation Switched-Capacitor DC&#8211;DC Converter Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10509707</link><description>Side-channel attacks (SCAs) have been shown to be very effective in breaking cryptographic engines.

To enhance energy efficiency of such error-resilient applications, state-of-the-art (SoA) CGRAs exploit approximation techniques, while maintaining an acceptable accuracy for the final quality of result (QoR). However, such CGRAs suffer from overheads of utilizing separate Add/Mul/Div units. We propose GREEN as an energy-efficient CGRA, which enables synergistic effects of a chain of approximation and optimization techniques in various levels of abstraction, from application-, to architecture-, to circuit-level, in a cross-layer hierarchy. Enabling this, GREEN offers different levels of energy-accuracy tradeoffs through the flexibility of its small processing elements (PEs), each of which can support various functionalities and precision-adaptability in a single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) or multiple instruction, multiple data (MIMD) manner. Experimental results obtained with Synopsys Design Compiler and Cadence Innovus at 45-nm CMOS technology node demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed SISD/SIMD/MIMD CGRA over the accurate and SoA counterparts. In particular, the MIMD mode of GREEN enables up to  $6.6\times $  higher throughput while dissipating 21% less energy than the accurate counterpart. Moreover, the end-to-end evaluation of GREEN variants on eight single- and multikernel applications from classification, bio-signal (ECG/EEG), and image/video processing domains demonstrates significant performance improvement, compared to the accurate CGRA. In particular, GREEN-MIMD not only speed-ups the ECG QRS detection by 49% and consumes 43% less area and 66% less energy than the accurate CGRA, but also maintains the heartbeat detection accuracy at 100%. GREEN implementations is available at https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/pd-downloads.</description></item><item><title>STATION: State Encoding-Based Attack-Resilient Sequential Obfuscation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10502250</link><description>The unauthorized duplication of design intellectual property (IP) and illegal overproduction of integrated circuits (ICs) are hardware security threats plaguing the security of the globalized IC supply chain. Researchers have developed various countermeasures, such as logic locking, layout camouflaging, and split manufacturing, to overcome the security threat of IP piracy and unauthorized overproduction. Logic locking is a holistic solution among all countermeasures since it safeguards the design IP against untrusted entities, such as untrusted foundries, test facilities, or end-users, throughout the globalized IC supply chain. There are well-known logic locking techniques for combinational circuits with well-established security properties; however, their sequential counterparts remain vulnerable. Since most practical designs are inherently sequential, it is essential to develop secure obfuscation techniques to protect sequential designs. This article proposes a sequential obfuscation technique, STATION, building on the principles of finite state machine encoding schemes. STATION is resilient against various attacks on sequential obfuscation&#8212;input-output (I/O) query attacks and structural attacks, including the ones targeting sequential obfuscation&#8212;which have broken all state-of-the-art sequential obfuscation techniques. STATION achieves good resilience and desired security against various I/O and structural attacks, which we ascertain by launching 9 different attacks on all tested circuits. Moreover, STATION ensures tolerable overheads in power, performance, and area, such as 8.75%, 1.22%, and 5.63% on the largest tested circuit, containing 102 inputs, 7 outputs,  ${6.1\times 10^{4}}$  gates, 7 flip flops, 100 states, and  ${3.0\times 10^{3}}$  transitions.</description></item><item><title>RE-Specter: Examining the Architectural Features of Configurable CNN With Power Side-Channel</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10509603</link><description>As domain-specific training data is recognized as valuable intellectual property, acquiring well-trained weights in convolutional neural networks (CNN) has emerged as a new threat to the neural network design community. To design a CNN accelerator that is resilient to side-channel threats, it is crucial to have an accurate and efficient security-driven framework at the early design stage. However, there is no standard way to perform root-cause analysis on the power side channel that exists in FPGA-based CNN accelerators. Therefore, we build RE-Specter, a framework that facilitates security-driven design space exploration (DSE) across various building components, combination patterns, and parallelism configurations in CNNs. The goal is to fully understand the power side-channel effects resulting from architectural modifications or optimization decisions. We further compare the benchmarks considering precision, resource utilization, and power side-channel leakage. Finally, we experimentally explore the design space of various architectural features. The experimental results show that low-bit precision delivers more secure architectures ( $68.9\times $  among DSPs,  $2439\times $  among LUTs) in measurement-to-disclosure (MTD), but mixed-precision strategies are necessary to maintain the model accuracy.

The execution span of each AC real-time tasks can be split into a couple of parts: 1) the mandatory part, execution of which offers a result of acceptable quality, followed by 2) the optional part, which can be executed partially or completely to refine the initially obtained result in order to increase the result-accuracy, while respecting the time constraint. In this article, we introduce a novel hybrid offline&#8211;online scheduling strategy, ARCTIC, for AC real-time tasks. The goal of real-time scheduler of ARCTIC is to maximize the results-accuracy (QoS) of the task set with opportunistic shedding of the optional part, while respecting system-wide constraints. During execution, ARCTIC retains exclusive copy of the private cache blocks only in the local caches in a multicore system and no copies of these blocks are maintained at the other caches, and improves performance (i.e., reduces execution-time) by accumulating more live blocks on-chip. Combining offline scheduling with the online cache optimization improves both QoS and energy efficiency. While surpassing prior arts, our proposed strategy reduces the task rejection rate by up to 25%, whereas enhances QoS by 10%, with an average energy&#8211;delay&#8211;product gain of up to 9.1%, on an 8-core system.</description></item><item><title>MCAM: Memductance Components Adaptive Model for Efficient Modeling of Memductance of Memristive Devices for Neuromorphic Circuits and Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10494379</link><description>As an emerging technology, memristive devices have flourished to develop energy-efficient computing systems in the form of emerging nonvolatile memories (eNVMs), synaptic connections, and logic design, which could play a critical role in microelectronic design. In neuromorphic applications, the power-off state of a nonvolatile memristor is crucial, as it determines the learning and forgetting of embedded synaptic efficacy. Due to the complexity of the transport mechanisms contributing to the memristor current, memristor modeling remains a critical challenge. The memductance of memristors includes both volatile and nonvolatile components, which can be modeled using a memductance components adaptive model (MCAM). The MCAM enables researchers to model the memductance of memristors, which can be used in neuromorphic applications and logic design. Mathematical explanations and two physical models of memristors extracted from experimental results demonstrate the model&#8217;s accuracy. The application of MCAM for synaptic updates in spiking neuromorphic systems is also shown.</description></item><item><title>Systematic Generation of Memristor-Transistor Single-Phase Combinational Logic Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10488036</link><description>The objective of our research is to create efficient methods and tools for the quick and thorough assessment of emerging digital circuit devices, facilitating the adoption of promising ones. In this work, we develop methods and tools for hybrid technology that combines memristors with MOS transistors and demonstrates their effectiveness. Although several types of memristor-transistor logic have been proposed, 15 years of research has created a small set of logic cells. We propose a systematic method for generating new and efficient memristor-transistor single-phase combinational logic cells. At the core of our approach is a cell enumerator, which enables us to explore a wide range of cell designs, including nonintuitive ones, and a data-driven inductive learning method, which identifies new properties of such cells and scales up our explorations. In conjunction with other completely new tools, these create a comprehensive and definitive library of logic cells. Our new cells provide significant improvements or significantly distinct Pareto-optimal alternatives for the few logic functions for which prior research has created cells. Importantly, our methods enable us to discover a previously unknown synergistic operation between memristors and transistors that occurs for specific cell topologies. We harness this synergy to develop a method for adding memristors to low-area pass-transistor circuits such that they produce strong output voltages and low power, including for patterns that cause ratioed operation. We have also developed a new memristor-transistor logic family, namely controlled-AND (cAND)/controlled-OR (cOR), which includes many of the best cells. We have also developed a constructive method for designing such cells.</description></item><item><title>Unleashing Network/Accelerator Co-Exploration Potential on FPGAs: A Deeper Joint Search</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10505904</link><description>Recently, algorithm-hardware (HW) co-exploration for neural networks (NNs) has become the key to obtaining high-quality solutions. However, previous efforts for field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) focus on neural architecture search (NAS) while lacking HW architecture search (HAS), thus limiting the full potential of co-design. Although expanding the scope of HAS offers performance potential, the exponentially increased joint search space presents a formidable challenge. To address this, we propose a deep and efficient framework NAF, which jointly searches for Networks and Accelerators for FPGAs in a balanced co-search space. First, we adjust the NAS space and then introduce a block-level bitwidth search on the software side. Meanwhile, we design a HW-friendly quantization algorithm to facilitate HW efficiency and accuracy. Second, we design a dataflow-configurable HW unit with computation and memory access optimizations for quantized multiplication. Based on this, we incorporate critical heterogeneous multicore architecture exploration on the HW side. Third, to enable rapid HW feedback in the enlarged HAS space, we perform resource and performance modeling and design a fast HW generation algorithm based on the genetic algorithm. Specifically, we apply optimization techniques, like mapping space pruning, greedy bandwidth allocation, and coarse-grained search, to speed up this process. We validate NAF in edge and cloud scenarios. Experimental results show that NAF efficiently explores a significantly larger joint space and provides high-quality solutions. Compared with previous state-of-the-art co-design works, the searched convolutional neural network-accelerator pairs improve the throughput by  $2.07\times \sim 7.10\times $  and energy efficiency by  $1.41\times \sim 2.27\times $  under similar accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.</description></item><item><title>Cascade: An Application Pipelining Toolkit for Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Arrays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504565</link><description>While coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) have emerged as promising programmable accelerator architectures, they require automatic pipelining of applications during their compilation flow to achieve high performance. Current CGRA compilers either lack pipelining altogether resulting in low application performance, or perform exhaustive pipelining resulting in high power and resource consumption. We address these challenges by proposing Cascade, an end-to-end open-source application compiler for CGRAs that achieves both state-of-the-art performance and fast compilation times. The contributions of this work are: 1) a novel post place-and-route (PnR) application pipelining technique for CGRAs that accounts for interconnect hop delays during pipelining but in a unique way that avoids cyclic scheduling and PnR, 2) a register resource usage optimization technique that leverages the scheduling logic in CGRA memory tiles to minimize the number of register resources used during pipelining, and 3) an automated CGRA timing model generator, an application timing analysis tool, and a large set of existing and novel application pipelining techniques integrated into an end-to-end compilation flow. Cascade achieves 8 -  $34\times $  lower critical path delay and 7 -  $190\times $  lower energy-delay product (EDP) across a variety of dense image processing and machine learning workloads, and 3 -  $5.2\times $  lower critical path delay and 2.5 -  $5.2\times $  lower EDP on sparse workloads, compared to a compiler without pipelining. Cascade mitigates the performance and energy-efficiency drawbacks of existing CGRA compilers, and enables further research into CGRAs as flexible, yet competitive accelerator architectures.</description></item><item><title>EnsGuard: A Novel Acceleration Framework for Adversarial Ensemble Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10502340</link><description>To defend against various adversarial attacks, it is essential to develop a robust and high computing efficiency defence framework. Adversarial ensemble learning is the most effective technique for defending against adversarial example attacks, which constructs ensembles of multiple Deep neural networks (DNNs) with adversarial training to obtain stronger defense. However, ensemble models run noticeably slower on existing DNN accelerators than single-model inference. Deploying ensemble models on the existing DNN accelerators leads to many critical issues such as the underutilization of hardware resources. To tackle emerging challenges, we propose EnsGuard, a dynamic asymmetric multicore systolic array architecture for adversarial ensemble learning inference to fully exploit both static and dynamic parallelism of ensemble models. Specifically, on the hardware level, we propose a novel instruction set extension and develop efficient architecture components to fully exploit the new hardware abstraction of scattered idle computing cores, and use them to dynamically create on-the-fly neural processing units (fNPUs). Moreover, we propose a computing power recycle mechanism to run on-the-fly models (small models) on fNPUs by carefully orchestrating execution order of ensemble models for maximizing hardware resources and bandwidth utilization. On the software level, EnsGuard adopts an integrated hardware/randomized ensemble co-design optimizer aiming at winning both faster inference and higher adversarial robustness. On top of that, a multimodel mapping method based on decision tree is proposed to enable the interleaving of different DNN executions both spatially and temporally, and mitigate straggler problems. Evaluation with a diverse set of workloads shows significant gains in throughput ( $4.4\times $ ) and energy reduction ( $3.2\times $ ).</description></item><item><title>Secure Delegated Variational Quantum Algorithms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10505905</link><description>Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) can train parameterized quantum circuits via classical optimizers to find approximate solutions to some important problems. They can overcome the limitations of existing quantum technologies only allowing for a few qubits and small circuit depth and are considered as one of the most promising methods for achieving quantum advantages in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era. In this article, we propose secure delegated VQAs by utilizing quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE) for users with limited quantum power to delegate the task of running VQAs to remote quantum servers while still keeping the training data private. First, a client-friendly QHE scheme that allows quantum servers to perform calculation on encrypted data is proposed to be suitable for VQAs. Then, delegated VQAs based on the given QHE scheme are presented, where servers can train the ansatz circuit using the encrypted data. Finally, a delegated variational quantum classifier to identify handwritten digit images is given as a specific example of delegated VQAs and simulated on the cloud platform of Original Quantum to show the feasibility. Secure delegated VQAs will provide significant technical support for future quantum cloud services.</description></item><item><title>AutoAI2C: An Automated Hardware Generator for DNN Acceleration on Both FPGA and ASIC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508183</link><description>Recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) and the slowing of Moore&#8217;s law have made domain-specific hardware accelerators for DNNs (i.e., DNN chips) a promising means for enabling more extensive DNN applications. However, designing DNN chips is challenging due to: 1) the vast and nonstandardized design space and 2) different DNN models&#8217; varying performance preferences regarding hardware micro-architecture and dataflows. Therefore, designing a DNN chip often takes a large team of interdisciplinary experts months to years. To enable flexible and efficient DNN chip design, we propose AutoAI2C: a DNN chip generator that can automatically generate both FPGA- and ASIC-based DNN accelerator implementation (i.e., synthesizable hardware and deployment code) with optimized algorithm-to-hardware mapping, given the DNN model specification from mainstream machine learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch). Specifically, AutoAI2C consists of two major components: 1) a Chip Predictor, which can efficiently and reliably predict a DNN accelerator&#8217;s energy, latency, and resource consumption using the proposed graph-based intermediate accelerator representation and 2) a Chip Builder, which can generate and optimize DNN accelerator designs by automatically exploring the design space based on targeting metrics and the Chip Predictor&#8217;s performance feedback. Extensive experiments show that our Chip Predictor&#8217;s predictions differ by &lt;10% from real-measured ones. Furthermore, AutoAI2C generated accelerators can achieve performance comparable to or better than state-of-the-art accelerators, achieving up to a  $2.12\times $  throughput improvements or  $2.4\times $  latency reduction with the same level of hardware resource usage, or reducing energy consumption by up to  $1.6\times $ , when running the same DNN workloads.</description></item><item><title>Intelligent Inverse Designs of Impedance Matching Circuits With Generative Adversarial Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10492453</link><description>Impedance matching circuits (IMCs) are crucial modules in radio frequency (RF) front-end components, devices, and systems, affecting the performance of the whole systems. However, the design process of IMCs has to require intense manual interventions with high computational costs. To alleviate this problem, a novel scheme for inversely designing IMCs is presented in this work based on neural network technology. Such IMC inverse design framework consists of two mapping-based deep neural networks (DNNs). The first one is an untrained generative adversarial network (GAN) that maps from the design requirements to the regularized S-parameters curves. The second one is an inversion network that maps from the S-parameters and the target impedance to the designed circuit parameters. With the cascaded GAN and inversion network, an efficient method for designing IMC-based filtering antenna is introduced, which takes about 1/17 the time compared to the traditional EM-based design and optimization methods. Further, three power amplifiers (PAs) with multiple IMCs are inversely-designed based on the proposed framework. In experimental demonstration, the elaborate prototypes are fabricated and measured, where the measured results fully satisfy the demand performance.</description></item><item><title>ChatEDA: A Large Language Model Powered Autonomous Agent for EDA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10485372</link><description>The integration of a complex set of electronic design automation (EDA) tools to enhance interoperability is a critical concern for circuit designers.

This article proposes a deep-testing method for identifying Trojans of particular concern to middle-to-high-end users, with a focus on illegal instructions. A hidden instruction Trojan can employ a low-probability sequence of normal instructions as a boot sequence, which is followed by an illegal instruction that triggers the Trojan. This enables the Trojan to remain deeply hidden within the processor. It then exploits an intrusion mechanism to acquire Linux control authority by setting a hidden interrupt as its payload. We have developed an unbounded model checking (UMC) technique to uncover such Trojans. The proposed UMC technique has been optimized with slicing based on the input cone, head-point replacement, and backward implication. Our experimental results demonstrate that the presented instruction Trojans can survive detection by existing methods, thus allowing normal users to steal root user privileges and compromising the security of processors. Moreover, our proposed deep-testing method is empirically shown to be a powerful and effective approach for detecting these instruction Trojans.</description></item><item><title>One-Shot Online Testing of Deep Neural Networks Based on Distribution Shift Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10494391</link><description>Neural networks (NNs) are capable of learning complex patterns and relationships in data to make predictions with high accuracy, making them useful for various tasks. However, NNs are both computation-intensive and memory-intensive methods, making them challenging for edge applications. Hence, hardware AI accelerators architectures based on computation-in-memory (CiM) architectures with nonvolatile memristive crossbars are gaining attention. Although memristive devices offer benefits, such as power efficiency, parallelism, and nonvolatility, they suffer from nonidealities, leading to various faults and parameter variations, both during manufacturing and lifetime operations. This can lead to faulty computations and, in turn, degradation of post-mapping inference accuracy, which is unacceptable for many applications, including safety-critical applications. Therefore, proper testing of NN hardware accelerators is of utmost importance for functional safety. In this article, we propose a one-shot testing approach that can test NNs accelerated on memristive crossbars with only one test vector, making it very suitable for online testing applications. Our approach can consistently achieve 100% fault coverage across several large topologies with up to 201 layers and challenging tasks like semantic segmentation. Nevertheless, compared to existing methods, the fault coverage is improved by up to 24%, the memory overhead is only 0.0123 MB, a reduction of up to  $19980\times $  and the number of test vectors is reduced by  $10000\times $ .</description></item></channel></rss>
