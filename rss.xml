First, the system with hybrid topology relay is proposed and the relay coil is integrated on the receiving side. Second, two adjustment factors &#945; and &#946; are generated by introducing the hybrid topology relay, where &#945; is mainly used to design the equivalent MI value and &#946; is mainly applied to adjust the fluctuation of the equivalent MI. As a result, equivalent MI can be enhanced, and misalignment tolerance can be also optimized and improved. In addition, the power transmission capability can also be improved because the transconductance gain is proportional to the equivalent MI. Finally, the experimental setup, with a power output of 3.3 kW, is constructed. The constant current output characteristic and high misalignment tolerance are verified. The results show that the dc&#8211;dc efficiency is higher than 93.05% within the 100 mm horizontal misalignment range, and the fluctuation percentage of the equivalent MI is only 4.89%.</description></item><item><title>A Dual-Band Rectifier With a Novel Impedance Compression Network for WPT</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10878802</link><description>In this work, a dual-band rectifier with an impedance compression network (ICN) is designed for wireless power transfer. The proposed ICN is connected to the parallel subrectifiers that utilize a voltage-doubling topology.

The proposed system reduces the cost, weight, and volume of the power conversion units by sharing active switch bridges and magnetic coupler coils without mechanical switches. The proposed magnetic coupler design method enables the secondary coil to be shared in both OBC and WPT modes, while the primary coil for OBC can be magnetically decoupled from the transmitter coil in WPT mode. Based on the proposed topology configuration and winding method, the proposed system operates as a dual-active bridge and an inductor-capacitor-capacitor-series (LCC-S) compensated converter in the OBC and WPT modes, respectively.

However, it has the issue of heat concentration, which leads to severe thermal imbalance and high thermal stress, posing a challenge to thermal design. In this letter, thermal balance control strategy is utilized by exchanging the drive signals of two-phase circuits, which can periodically change the loss distribution among the switches, suppressing the above problem. By compensating for the current variation, it effectively eliminates current overshoot and oscillation during transition, thereby mitigating inductor saturation and enhancing the reliability of the system. Furthermore, a thermoelectric coupling analysis method is proposed to evaluate the performance of the converter and provide guidance for converter design. Experimental and simulation results have been presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.</description></item><item><title>Zero-Sequence Current and Voltage Control Strategy of Multiple MMCs for Single-Phase Ground Fault Protection in AC&#8211;DC Hybrid Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10848207</link><description>The ac/dc hybrid distribution network (HDN) is facing great challenges under single-phase ground (SPG) fault. To ensure the continuous and stable operation of ac/dc HDNs, it is essential that the converters have fault control and relay protection capabilities. The previous studies focused only on a single converter, this article first proposes a zero-sequence current and voltage control strategy for multiple modular multilevel converters (MMCs). The zero-sequence current control strategy includes active arc suppression and zero-sequence current suppression. The active arc suppression can achieve relay protection functions such as arc suppression, fault type determination, fault localization, and fault removal perception. The zero-sequence current suppression can achieve SPG fault isolation to ensure that the power quality of the nonfaulty grid is not affected. The zero-sequence voltage control strategy includes zero-sequence voltage cooperative control and zero-sequence voltage feedforward control, which can optimize the voltage capacity of each MMC and reduce the fault control requirements of the ac/dc HDN. The whole proposed strategy can realize the self-healing of SPG faults, which can improve the reliability of distribution network power supply. The effectiveness of the strategy is fully verified by simulation and experiment.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing the Dynamic Performance of Current-Fed Triple-Active-Bridge DC&#8211;DC Converters Utilizing Freewheeling States for Inductor-Current Adjustment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10857633</link><description>This article provides the analytical and experimental exploration of a control strategy that enhances the dynamic performance of current-fed triple-active-bridge (CFTAB) dc&#8211;dc converters to its physical limits. So far, dynamic current transients in the inductors of CFTAB converters are poorly discussed in the literature. Published simulation and measurement results of load steps are usually plotted on a large timescale so that the fast transient behavior on switching-cycle timescale is barely visible. In this work, the freewheeling states current adjustment (FSCA) strategy is examined that reaches the new steady state as fast as physically possible. In addition to the analytical derivation of the FSCA strategy, theoretical limitations are presented and validated on a 1-kW GaN-based prototype of the CFTAB converter. Measurement results confirm that the FSCA strategy significantly reduces overshoots and oscillations. The settling time after a load step is reduced from about 1 ms down to 10 $\mu \mathrm{s}$, which yields a time reduction by a factor of 100.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability Analysis for Hybrid Parallel-Connected Converters by Two-Dimensional Phase Portrait</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10855672</link><description>A hybrid parallel-connected system with grid-following (GFL) and grid-forming (GFM) converters can be characterized as a high-order nonlinear dynamic system when performing transient synchronous stability analysis, which cannot be analyzed clearly by the existing method. The existing methods analyze the power angle for each converter individually, which fails to elucidate the transient coupling dynamic process of the power angles among different converters. To fill this gap, a 2-D phase portrait method is proposed by structure-preserving dimensionality reduction mapping, which can effectively reveal the interactive dynamics between GFM converter and GFL converter. The four types of factors, which impact the transient stabilization are elaborated by the proposed method. Furthermore, the influence of current limiting strategies on the transient stability is revealed by applying the 2-D phase portrait. Finally, experimental results are provided to verify the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Implementation of SOLM as an Extended SVPWM for Variable Six Pulse DC-Bus Electrolytic Capacitor-Less VSI Based Constant V/f Induction Motor Drive</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10857374</link><description>Synchronous one-leg modulation (SOLM) technique has been used for six-pulse dc-bus electrolytic capacitor-less voltage source inverter (VSI) considering reduced switching loss compared to space vector pulsewidth modulation (SVPWM). The existing method for generating the modulating signal in SOLM technique utilizes a sector identification-based approach. This work demonstrates, through both mathematical analysis and hardware results, that despite differences in the dc-bus voltage, modulating signal and instantaneous pole voltage waveforms between SVPWM and SOLM techniques, their average pole voltages are identical. Based on this understanding, this work proposes implementing the SOLM technique as an extension of SVPWM technique without requiring sector identification. A comparison between the proposed and the existing implementations of SOLM shows reduction in computational effort. A 1.25-kVA hardware prototype was developed for open-loop V/f control of a 1-hp induction motor. A comparison has been made between SVPWM with fixed dc-bus voltage, SVPWM with variable dc-bus voltage and SOLM with variable six-pulse dc-bus voltage. VSI efficiency with SOLM was in the range of 98.4%&#8211;99.1% at different operating conditions. Operation of the converter was successfully demonstrated under motor acceleration, steady-state operation as well as during deceleration.</description></item><item><title>Direct DC-Bus Control for Grid-Forming Converters: Toward the Concept of Dual-Voltage-Forming Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858748</link><description>A control method for regulating both dc- and ac-side voltages, based on a disturbance observer, is presented. This method provides a voltage-source behavior from the ac-side perspective, a key functionality of grid-forming converters. A dynamic model is derived to develop the control law using feedback linearization. The control method is able to maintain the dc- and ac-side voltages without any cascaded loops. The method is, therefore, named the dual-voltage forming method to differentiate it from the recent definitions of grid-forming converters. The use of a disturbance observer provides integral action and also inherent synchronization. A transparent current controller is implemented to protect the converter from overcurrents. Small-signal stability of the proposed method is studied analytically and design guidelines are drawn from the analysis. Furthermore, the asymmetric behavior of the converter in different operating modes is analytically assessed. The performance of the method is tested in experimental conditions using a 12.5-kVA test setup. The control method exhibits robust performance in both strong and weak grids in terms of dc-bus voltage reference tracking as well as the capacity to survive large external power variations with power-flow direction changes. Moreover, the effect of a grid voltage sag is studied.</description></item><item><title>A Novel CTTC Structure and Optimization Design Method for CLLC Bidirectional Resonant Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858669</link><description>The resonant tank of CLLC converter incorporates numerous magnetic components. To enhance power density, magnetic integration technology has become a key research focus.

A performance evaluation of the CLLC converter utilizing the CTTC structure has been conducted, focusing on the effects of circuit parasitic parameters and leakage inductors. Finally, the validity is verified by a 3 kW bidirectional CLLC prototype.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Phase Four-Leg Neutral-Point-Clamped Photovoltaic Inverter With Decoupled Active and Reactive Power Control and DC-Link Voltage Ripple Minimization Under Unbalanced Grid Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10870423</link><description>This article analyzes the performance of a three-phase four-leg three-level neutral-point-clamped-based photovoltaic (PV) inverter, which is connected to an unbalanced grid. The PV source terminals are connected to the dc link of the inverter through a three-level dc&#8211;dc boost converter, which helps in controlling the individual dc-link capacitor voltages. In this article, a space-vector-control-based voltage balancing strategy is introduced for balancing the individual dc-link capacitor voltages under unbalanced grid operation. In addition, the amplitude and phase angle of individual-phase currents are thoroughly studied to understand their dependence on the percentage of unbalancing in the grid voltage and, therefore, to decide the maximum allowable current that can flow through any particular phase leg under a given unbalancing condition. A control method for minimizing voltage ripple of the individual dc-link capacitors using the boost converter is then proposed, which ensures that the capacitors do not persist any voltage overshoot under limited neutral current operation. The PV-generated grid-tied system is implemented on a scaled-down laboratory-based experimental prototype to validate the aforementioned claims and substantiate the efficacy of the proposed control techniques.</description></item><item><title>Energy Harmonic Stability Analysis of Energy-Balancing Control for Modular Multilevel Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874221</link><description>The energy-balancing control (EBC) plays a crucial role in the proper functioning of the modular multilevel converter (MMC). However, regarding the stability analysis of MMC energy balance, the discussion on internal energy balance is usually ignored, whereas it has been demonstrated in the existing literature that the capacitor energy harmonics may affect the system stability. This article considers the impact of capacitor energy harmonics on EBC and obtains its steady-state time-invariant form. Based on this, small-signal modeling of both dc-side EBC and ac-side EBC of the MMC is conducted, and the stability of EBC is systematically discussed. Through eigenvalue and participation factor analysis, it is revealed that the coupling caused by energy harmonics in sum and differential energy control contributes to the poor stability of EBC. To address this stability issue, parameter selection recommendations for EBC are proposed. By adopting these recommendations, the dynamic performance of EBC can be maximized while ensuring system stability. The accuracy of the obtained conclusions and the effectiveness of the proposed parameter selection recommendations are verified through simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Immittance-Based Stability and Instability Participation Analysis for DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874184</link><description>The existing immittance-based stability analysis approaches for dc microgrids rarely account for the line network, and they are always troubled by the non-minimum phase issues. In this article, we introduce a novel method for stability analysis based on the determinant of the constructed immittance matrix. Since the determinant's right-half-plane poles are explicitly proven absent, it is only necessary to ascertain the net number of times that the phase trajectory crosses the &#177;180&#176; line in system stability analysis. Subsequently, based on the immittance matrix decomposition and sensitivity calculation, a participation analysis method is further presented to identify the critical converter that dominates system instability. Finally, the simulation case of a 750 V 30 kW dc microgrid and the experiment case of a 24 V 180 W dc microgrid are established to validate these methods.</description></item><item><title>Harmonic Programmed Modulation for High-Power Medium Voltage Energy Conversion: Formulation, Solving Approach, and Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10877753</link><description>High-power (MW) energy conversion systems typically operate at much lower switching frequencies than low-power (kW-100&#8201;s kW) systems.

At the end, a discussion on the future development of HPPWM is provided.</description></item><item><title>Multimotor Synchronous and Antidisturbance Control for Two-Stage Friction Wheels Launcher</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10876803</link><description>The purpose of this article is to propose a model predictive repeated learning (MPRL) control strategy to achieve high-performance control of the multimotor servo control (MMSC) system. The control strategy generates feedforward by learning the synchronization uncertainty between motors, reduces the synchronization error between motors, and improves the synchronization of the MMSC system. High-precision speed tracking is achieved through state prediction, and energy constraints are incorporated into the controller to reduce energy loss in the MMSC system. The trigger mode and input distribution are used to compensate for the impact on the system, and stable speed tracking and synchronization of the MMSC system under impact disturbances are achieved. Finally, a composite control scheme is obtained. Compared with conventional methods, the MPRL method can handle synchronization uncertainty, compensate for disturbances caused by shocks, and simultaneously obtain high-precision speed tracking and speed synchronization between motors. A research prototype of the two-stage launcher system is developed, and experimental setup is constructed. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the MPRL method and its advantages compared with conventional methods.</description></item><item><title>Accurate Modeling and Elimination of Vertical Crossings for Multisampled Single-Phase DC&#8211;AC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10878123</link><description>The multisample-multiupdate (MSMU) scheme is an effective approach to reduce delay in digitally controlled power converters. However, basic MSMU leads to current distortion from the vertical crossing (VC) of the modulation signal and carrier signal, which loses the closed-loop regulation. Therefore, it is significant to predict and eliminate the VC to avoid its negative influences. This article proposes an accurate model of VC in multisampled single-phase dc&#8211;ac converters. The total digital delay, the duty ratio, and the proportional gain in the system are the critical factors. Then, a modulation compensator is proposed to eliminate VC based on the prediction of the modulation signal. When the vertical crossing is detected by prediction, the modulation signal is compensated to imitate natural sampling. The proposed method features lower current distortion than existing methods, and it enhances the dissipative region of the system because it avoids using filters that will introduce equivalent delay. Finally, the theoretical analysis is validated by the simulation and the experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Design of a Single-Stage Dual Active Bridge Microinverter With Wide Load Adaptability Based on Loss Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10877789</link><description>This article presents an optimized design of a single-stage dual active bridge (DAB) dc&#8211;ac converter with off-grid load capability. DAB converters have attracted attention due to their bidirectional power transmission and high power density characteristics. However, adaptability to loads is required during off-grid operation of energy storage devices. Based on the linearization of control variables, a new control loop is established in this article. The objective is to minimize current stress and root mean square current, which constrains the outer phase-shift angle, thereby enhancing system efficiency. Furthermore, from the perspective of the loss model, the optimal operating frequency range of the system was studied based on the selected switching devices. Combined with winding methods, the parameters of the magnetic components were optimized. This further improved the system's efficiency. A 600 W DAB microinverter prototype was built and experimentally verified on various loads. The results confirmed that the proposed method can improve the overall system efficiency and achieve a peak efficiency of 97.89% under resistive load.</description></item><item><title>Online Reactive Power Suppression Strategy for Triple Active Bridge Converter Based on Dynamic Fundamental Voltage-Balance Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10878299</link><description>The triple active bridge (TAB) converter presents a significant challenge for efficiency optimization due to its complex model resulting from power coupling between ports and multiple control degrees of freedom. Existing high-precision optimization strategies are often based on complex models and modulation methods, typically relying on offline optimization and online look-up tables during operation, making them difficult to apply widely in practical engineering scenarios. To address these challenges, an online reactive power suppression strategy is proposed, which reduces conduction losses by suppressing reactive power during operation. First, the total reactive power model is established, and a dynamic fundamental voltage-balance modulation (DFVM) strategy is employed to automatically suppress fundamental reactive power. Moreover, the zero-voltage-switching range can also be expanded. To further optimize the total reactive power, an additional degree of freedom (the shared phase-shift coefficient $d_{\text{CP}}$) is introduced into the control strategy, which can be dynamically adjusted based on operating conditions. Furthermore, by analyzing the slopes of $d_{\text{CP}}$ and the outer phase shifts in relation to output power and reactive power, an incremental balance-based iterative optimization method was proposed. This method enables adaptive online calculation of the optimal $d_{\text{CP}}$, thereby enhancing the applicability of the control algorithm. Finally, a 3.3-kW prototype was developed to validate the proposed strategy, achieving a peak efficiency of 95.3%. Under light-load conditions, efficiency improved by 5.13% compared to existing online strategies.</description></item><item><title>DC&#8211;AC Talkative Power Conversion Based on Variable Zero-Vector Position Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10882991</link><description>Talkative power conversion (TPC), which embeds information in the switching ripple to achieve simultaneous power and data transmission without installing any or few additional hardware at the transmitter side, can reduce the additional communication infrastructure needed in cyber-physical systems like smart grids and renewable power plants. While in dc&#8211;dc converters TPC has been the subject of numerous investigations, dc&#8211;ac converters have received less attention. Recently, zero vectors of three-phase dc&#8211;ac converters were used to embed data, and variable zero vector width modulation TPC has been investigated. In this study, a novel zero vector-based modulation, called variable zero-vector position modulation, is proposed for three-phase dc&#8211;ac TPC with improved communication performance. This type of dc&#8211;ac converter can send data through the power line to the demodulator with good power quality. The viability of using sliding fast fourier transform (FFT)-based demodulation for target side-band harmonics is supported by a mathematical study of the harmonic distribution. The results of MATLAB/Simulink-based simulations and scaled-down prototype-based experimental results verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis. Besides, the bit error rate is evaluated for different line lengths and zero vector positions.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Analog Control Strategy With Simplified Implementation Scheme for Boundary Conduction Mode Flyback Microinverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887041</link><description>With the continuous reduction in the per-watt cost of photovoltaic modules, the complexity and cost of the controller circuit are becoming one of the key factors limiting the competitiveness of flyback microinverters in cost-sensitive PV applications. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel analog control strategy for boundary conduction mode flyback microinverters. This strategy utilizes a minimal number of basic analog components to achieve low total harmonic distortion in grid-connected current and high static and dynamic MPPT efficiencies. To enable peak-current control, a dedicated analog divider circuit, consisting of only three basic components, is designed to perform complex computations typically required for the traditional current reference. Using this divider, low harmonic distortion grid-connected current and a high power factor can be achieved. In addition, an improved analog MPPT strategy with optimized perturbation logic and control timing is introduced to simplify the hardware implementation and eliminate misjudgment issues caused by the double-line frequency power fluctuations. The improved strategy enables both high efficiency and stable MPPT control without the need for additional timers and signal conditioning circuits. Experimental results on a 125 W prototype are presented to validate the advantages of the proposed analog control strategy.</description></item><item><title>Modified Discrete-Time Super-Twisting Control of PMSM Speed Regulation System: Theory and Experimentation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884027</link><description>The article puts forward a modified discrete-time super-twisting (DTST) control strategy for the speed regulation system of permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) to strengthen the control efficacy and resilience to disturbances in its digital execution. As opposed to the conventional DTST algorithm, the most discernible attribute for the developed scheme is to displace the discontinuous term in the conventional DTST by dint of a nonsmooth term in consequence of the constraint of the sampling frequency practically speaking. With consideration for this substitution, a flexibly tunable fractional power parameter is introduced to increase the control precision while mitigating the oscillations. The Lyapunov-based theoretical analysis is offered to rigorously validate the convergence for the correspondingly whole system. Eventually, in comparison with two existing control schemes, the effectiveness and superiority of the presented method are experimentally supported in real time through using a 1.5 kW PMSM hardware platform.</description></item><item><title>Multi Module Parallel MHz Power Amplifier with Hybrid Structure and Optimized Control Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884888</link><description>Megahertz power amplifiers typically modulate power by paralleled-architectures and outphasing methods. However, when power drops in a large ratio, the effective admittances of modules are always not within the high-efficiency range. This article optimizes four-paralleled-module system through two operation modes: four modules turn-on at high power and two modules turn-on at low power to reduce the effective susceptance range at low power. In addition, a combining network consisting of four independently optimized T-networks is proposed to provide ideal load conditions for each module during phase variation. With the help of new networks and hybrid modes, the system is optimized to ensure that the effective admittance trajectory of each module is within the minimum loss range. A 13.56 MHz prototype consisting of four Class E modules is constructed, which maintains an efficiency of 76%&#8211;89% with output power of 20&#8211;200 W, with an average improvement of 9.5% compared to asymmetric Chireix methods.</description></item><item><title>Antiovervoltage Control Strategy for Electrolytic Capacitorless PMSM Drives Based on Power Balance State Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10899754</link><description>Addressing the coupling effect between speed and voltage controllers in the traditional antiovervoltage control strategy for electrolytic capacitorless permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drives, a novel antiovervoltage control strategy based on power balance state regulation is proposed. The active&#8211;reactive power coordinate frame based on synthesized voltage vector orientation is constructed in the proposed scheme. Subsequently, the power balance current for maintaining dc-link voltage constant can be extracted independently of inverter and motor parameters. To achieve the decoupling between controllers, the power balance current is set as a threshold to switch the designed operating mode. Thus, the coupling issue can be solved between the speed and voltage controllers in the case of reduced dc-link capacitance values. To control the dc-link voltage following the designed voltage trajectory in braking mode, the active and reactive currents are allocated based on the power balance current. Furthermore, controller coefficients are designed from frequency domain to ensure a sufficient phase margin. While ensuring maximum copper loss, the dc-link voltage overshoot can be significantly reduced by the proposed scheme. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in 2.2-kW reduced dc-link capacitance PMSM drives. Compared with the traditional antiovervoltage control scheme, the proposed scheme can suppress dc-link voltage overshoot to 2%.</description></item><item><title>Stray Inductance Extraction Methods for Power Modules: A Comprehensive Review and Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10848351</link><description>The stray inductance of the commutation circuit significantly impacts power semiconductor device switching.

The tradition methods destroy the packaging component and are difficult to obtain the maximum temperature of PP IGBT. A temperature sensor integrated method for directly obtaining the maximum temperature of PP IGBT chip is proposed in this article. Due to the uneven temperature distribution on the surface of the chip, the maximum temperature measurement depends on the mounting positions of temperature sensors. Three mounting positions of temperature sensors including the gap between gate pad and emitter molybdenum (Mo), the emitter Mo, and the gate pogo pin are reasonably proposed by theory analysis. The finite element simulations and constant current source tests show that as the clamping force increases, the maximum temperature point drifts from the center of the emitter surface to the gap. The maximum temperature of PP IGBT chip is increased after the emitter Mo is grooved. The mounting position located at the head of gate pogo pin avoids the influence of stress on the temperature sensor. The feasibility of the proposed method is verified based on a half-bridge inverter.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Transient Model of Field-Stop IGBT Accounting for Temperature Dependence</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10900567</link><description>The field-stop (FS) insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) (FS IGBTs) become a mainstay in the IGBT market for medium and high-power applications nowadays.

It targets the high-frequency conducted EMI peaks that fall in the frequency range, $\text{2} \,{\mathrm{MHz}}$ - $\text{30} \,{\mathrm{MHz}}$, by distributing the high-frequency noise peak energy into several frequencies. Thus, it restricts the high-frequency oscillation generated due to the switching transients of the converter. In the proposed technology, a parallel combination of inductor and diode is connected in series with the dc-link capacitor of the converter. The inductance value is inversely proportional to the $di/dt$ of the converter switch and remains below 100 nH. The power dissipated in the diode is around $0.05 \,\%$ of the converter power rating, and its blocking voltage is less than $\text{5} \,\%$ of the dc-link voltage. Thus, the inductor and diode are smaller in size and cheaper in cost. The proposed technology has been experimentally validated on a SiC-mosfet based $\text{1} \,{\mathrm{kW}}$ dc&#8211;dc converter. The input voltage and current for the converter are $\text{200} \,{\mathrm{V}}$ and $\text{5} \,{\mathrm{A}}$, respectively. The proposed technique achieves $\text{16} \,{\mathrm{dB}}$ reduction of the noise peak at $\text{26} \,{\mathrm{MHz}}$.</description></item><item><title>Enabling High-Frequency Operation of MMC-Based Chargers: Frequency-Decoupled Modulation Strategy and Soft Switching</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854808</link><description>The demand for ultrafast charging of electric heavy-duty vehicles drives the development of megawatt-level interfaces with the medium-voltage grid. Modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based chargers offer a promising solution, utilizing a single medium-frequency transformer (MFT) to enhance power density. This article proposes a novel modulation strategy for ac/ac MMCs with rectangular-wave output that leverages the separation of low-frequency and medium-frequency components within the modulation stage. This separation reduces the scaling factor between the switching frequency and the MFT's operating frequency, enabling the use of higher operating frequencies for the MFT. This, in turn, facilitates the size reduction of the MFT without compromising the efficiency of the MMC. The findings demonstrate significant improvements in the modulator, including higher time resolution of waveform synthesis, and reduced harmonic distortion in the MMC's terminal voltages and currents. This, in turn, enables soft-switching operation in the power converters. Experimental results are given to validate the theoretical analysis and practical feasibility of the proposed modulation and soft-switching strategies.</description></item><item><title>High Power and High Repetition Frequency Nanosecond Marx Generator Based on Avalanche Transistor With Triggering Acceleration Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10855468</link><description>The high voltage nanosecond pulses with high pulse repetition frequency (PRF) and narrow pulse width are widely used in high power applications. The M&#215;N-stage Marx-bank circuit (MBC) based on the avalanche bipolar junction transistors (ABJTs) combines the advantages of simple construction and high output amplitude, making it an effective pulse generator for the above requirements. However, PRF of traditional M&#215;N-stage MBC is not improved effectively due to the poor reliability of ABJTs at 1-stage. In this work, the vulnerable properties of ABJT which is at first-stage and triggered by a slow voltage ramp are analyzed and explained by simulation and experiment. On this basis, a modified 4&#215;12-stage MBC with a triggering acceleration circuit (TAC) is proposed. The reliability of the most failure-prone ABJT in 4&#215;12-stage MBC is improved effectively by increasing triggering speed of the voltage ramp generated from TAC. Moreover, the influences of the components in MBC-TAC on the output characteristics are further analyzed and the high PRF and high reliability are verified. The 4&#215;12-stage MBC-TAC achieves an output amplitude of 5.1 kV, a rise time of 1.57 ns, a pulse width of 4.07 ns, and a PRF of 200 kHz. This investigation and improvement of MBC-TAC provides a reference for the applications of MBCs based on ABJTs.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid-Parallel Collaborative Simulation Framework Integrating Device Physics With Circuit Dynamics for PDAE-Modeled Power Electronic Equipment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854913</link><description>Optimizing high-performance power electronic equipment, such as power converters, requires multiscale simulations that incorporate the physics of power semiconductor devices and the dynamics of other circuit components, especially in conducting design of experiments (DoEs), defining the safe operating area of devices, and analyzing failures related to semiconductor devices. However, current methodologies either overlook the intricacies of device physics or do not achieve satisfactory computational speeds. To bridge this gap, this article proposes a hybrid-parallel collaborative (HPC) framework specifically designed to analyze the partial differential&#8211;algebraic equation (PDAE)-modeled power electronic equipment, integrating the device physics and circuit dynamics. The HPC framework employs a dynamic iteration to tackle the challenges inherent in solving the coupled nonlinear PDAE system and utilizes a hybrid-parallel computing strategy to reduce computing time. Physics-based system partitioning, along with hybrid-process-thread parallelization on shared and distributed memory, is employed, facilitating the simulation of hundreds of partial differential equations-modeled devices simultaneously without compromising speed. Experiments based on the hybrid-line commutated converter and reverse-blocking integrated gate-commutated thyristors are conducted under three typical real-world scenarios: semiconductor device optimization for the converter, converter design optimization, and device failure analysis. The HPC framework delivers simulation speed up to 60 times faster than the leading commercial software, while maintaining carrier-level accuracy in the experiments. This speedup becomes more pronounced as the number of semiconductor devices increases. This shows great potential for comprehensive analysis and collaborative optimization of devices and electronic power equipment, particularly in extreme conditions and failure scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic DC Voltage Enhancement for Modular Multilevel Converter Using Capacitor Voltage Ripple</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874206</link><description>High-power flexible dc links employ modular multilevel converters (MMC) for compact active power redirection in medium and high voltage grids. During contingencies, such converters may need to provide an enhanced active power capacity to avoid overload in vulnerable grid locations. This article achieves this target by using the capacitor voltage ripple margin of the MMC submodules (SM) to enhance the dc voltage beyond the rated value. This voltage enhancement enables the enhanced active power capacity of the MMC while maintaining rated electro&#8211;thermal stresses on the components. Moreover, dynamically varying the dc side voltage reduces the MMC's circulating current, improving its operating efficiency. Because the average capacitor voltage is controlled to remain constant, the overall stresses and harmonic performance of the enhanced MMC remain the same as in the base case. In this article, the analytical expressions for the voltage and power enhancement limits are derived, revealing a dependence on the grid-injected reactive power. Furthermore, a controller is designed to achieve stable operation during transient conditions when the power enhancement is carried out. Finally, the enhancement concept is validated using simulations and experiments with a down-scaled laboratory MMC prototype.</description></item><item><title>Gate Driver Power Supply With Low-Capacitance-Coupling and Constant Output Voltage for Medium-Voltage SiC MOSFETs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874144</link><description>With the development of wide band-gap devices, Silicon Carbide (SiC) semiconductor devices in 10&#8211;15 kV voltage class offer potentials in medium-voltage (MV) systems.

Typically, the duty cycle of boost converters is increased to achieve high voltage levels at their output. Prolonged duty cycles cause an increase in the duration of current flow through the switch and can lead to an increase in losses of the switch and other components of the converter. This article introduces a boost converter that provides high-voltage gains with limited duty cycles. Instead of one inductor used in a typical converter, the proposed converter uses three inductors. Two capacitors (in addition to the parallel capacitor at the output) are used to store more energy enabling the converter to enhance the output level. When the switch is activated, the current passing through the switch and other components of the converter is increased due to these capacitors. To overcome this problem, the proposed converter is equipped with an additional inductor in series with the source. This inductor leads to smoother current flow through the source. Another capacitor, charged by the input source, contributes to accomplishing soft switching. To show the operational capabilities of the proposed converter, results of manufacturing a prototype of the converter are presented.</description></item><item><title>The Magnetic Branch Snubber Channel and Magnetic Model Analysis for SM Capacitor Reduction of SST</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10876809</link><description>For a cascaded H-bridge-based solid-state transformer where the isolation stage is a quad active bridge (QAB), this article proposes a magnetic branch snubber channel scheme with zero harmonic impedance/flux.

However, the MMCC contains of numerous power modules and necessitates discrete dc-link voltage balancing and precharging control. They introduce severe cost issues: 1) voltage balancing control employs a substantial number of costly sensors to monitor dc-link voltages; 2) dc-link capacitor precharging control relies on expensive medium-voltage charging resistors and bypass breakers. This article proposes a novel hardware method for MMCC, which cost-effectively solves voltage balancing and precharging issues. It utilizes extra interconnecting-winding of the transformer and LC resonant tank as the high-frequency port to connect all modules in parallel on the ac bus for dc-link voltage autobalancing. Meanwhile, the ac bus connects with a low-voltage dc source via an auxiliary H-bridge to precharge all modules. Therefore, the proposal saves the costly sensors required for equalization control by dc-link voltage autobalancing feature. Additionally, the proposal removes expensive and bulky medium-voltage charging resistors and bypass breakers through the cost-effective low-voltage precharge structure. Compared to conventional MMCC, these novel structures reduce the total cost by more than 25% while simplifying circuit complexity, enhancing voltage balancing performance, and maintaining the same level of reliability. Nevertheless, the system efficiency is slightly compromised (0.12%). The feasibility of the proposal is verified by simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Improvement of Low-Switching-Frequency Rectifier With Hybrid Cascaded H-Bridge Multilevel Cell</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10882963</link><description>Due to device losses and heat dissipation, single-phase rectifiers in high-speed railways are operated at low-switching frequencies.

By circulant PWM (CPWM) control strategy, the output voltage can be regulated. Since, the switching patterns of the power devices are reconfigured under this modulation scheme, the resonant tank can operate in three-level or two-level modes. Therefore, two operation modes are obtained, ensuring that it can work over a wide voltage range while realizing zero-voltage switching (ZVS) for all switches. In addition, self-balancing of VSM capacitor voltages and high-efficiency are achieved. Compared with existing resonant topologies, the proposed solution not only has a smaller number of devices, but also the voltage stress on the input-side switches is lower than the input voltage for the entire wide voltage range.

The proposed topology is generated by integrating a two-phase interleaved current-fed LLC (TPICF-LLC) converter, which has the same number of primary switching devices and boost inductors as TPICF-LLC, but the resonant tank and rectifier circuit are shared. Compared with other interleaved structures, the proposed ICFI-LLC solution not only has moderate components, but also has lower voltage stress across the primary devices throughout the entire operating range, which reduces the cost of the devices and enables a more compact size. Through the circulant phase-shift control strategy and the two-phase interleaving technology, not only the current ripple on the input side can be kept at zero no matter how the input voltage and transmission power change, but also the capacitor voltages of the series connected voltage source submodules in the ICFI-LLC switching network have self-balancing capability without introducing complex equalization methods.

However, when the dc-side current harmonics introduced by these VSCs interact with inherent dcMG system resonances, the dcMG system stability and power quality will deteriorate. To address this issue, this article proposes a cost-effective dual-side selective harmonic elimination pulse-width modulation (DSSHE-PWM) technique for two-level VSCs. The proposed DSSHE-PWM simultaneously eliminates harmonics introduced by the VSC in both the ac-side voltages and the dc-side current. To achieve this, first, the correlation between the VSC modulation and the dc-side current harmonics is investigated. Subsequently, the corresponding ac-side voltage harmonics that create the concerned dc-side current harmonics are identified. These voltage harmonics are then incorporated into an optimization problem to generate switching patterns for the VSC. The effectiveness of the proposed technique in improving the power quality and stabilizing the dcMG system is validated with both simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Self-Adapted Predictive Control Strategy for High-Power Vehicular Fuel Cell System Thermal Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10705799</link><description>Effective thermal management is essential for the performance of high-power fuel cell systems, especially for vehicular applications. This study presents a novel self-adaptive predictive control (SAPC) strategy to address challenges posed by large time delay effects and time-variant characteristics in fuel cell systems. By integrating prediction and current information, SAPC reduces the time-domain signal mismatch induced by delay effects in the basic proportional&#8211;integral&#8211;derivative (PID) controller. Adaptive weight factors for the prediction component are tuned online for various scenarios, and online/offline model adjustments automatically adapt the dynamic transfer-function model to varying operational points and time-variant characteristics. Experimental validation on an 80 kW fuel cell system test bench demonstrates that SAPC significantly reduces temperature control error by 59% and 64.5%, overshoot by 74.6% and 70%, and mean settling time by 87.9% and 77.6% compared with two other conventional PID frameworks. This highlights SAPC as a promising solution for enhancing precise temperature control in high-power fuel cell systems within dynamic load conditions.</description></item><item><title>An Enhanced Transient Angle Stability Scheme of VSG Based on the PCH Theory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10691676</link><description>With the increasing number of distributed generations connected to the grid, the inertia of power grid turns out to be decreased. To address this problem, the virtual synchronous generator (VSG) is proposed, which mimics the mechanical characteristics of the traditional synchronous generators (SGs). However, the introduction of virtual inertia will induce the transient angle instability, which threatens the security and stability of power system when the grid voltage sag occurs. Few methods can effectively tackle this problem, particularly, when the grid voltage sag is severe. In this article, the mechanism of transient angle instability is analyzed, and an enhanced transient angle stability (TAS) scheme is proposed. First, the VSG system is designed as a port-controlled Hamiltonian (PCH) system. Based on the energy shaping, the control law of the PCH system, i.e., the reference active power of VSG is constructed to be model based. Second, benefitting from this model, the TAS can be enhanced by modifying the reference active power via the state variable feedback. Thus, an enhanced TAS scheme that employs the power angle variation is proposed. Moreover, the proposed scheme is proved to be effective in terms of the equal area criterion (EAC) even if the severe grid voltage sag occurs. Finally, the simulations and experiments are carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Joint Transient Angle and Voltage Stability Analysis and Enhancement of Grid-Forming Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10695768</link><description>As an enabling technology in more-electronic power systems, grid-forming converters have been increasingly popular. However, their transient behavior under grid faults has not been fully explored. In particular, existing literature only investigates the transient angle or voltage stability problem separately, without considering the case where both events occur concurrently. To fill in the research gap, this article provides a comprehensive analysis of both transient angle and voltage stability problems. We first derive the existence condition for equilibrium points. Then, we disclose the attraction domain of the stable equilibrium point by use of the LaSalle invariant set theorem. The derived stable conditions can ensure the safe operation of grid-forming converters during transients. Moreover, we reveal that the active power reduction and reactive power injection both enhance transient angle and voltage stability. Nevertheless, the active power reduction deteriorates frequency regulation, while the reactive power injection increases converter current stresses. Further, to mitigate these negative effects, we propose an active and reactive power co-regulation method to enhance the transient stability of grid-forming converters. Finally, simulation and experimental results verify the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>An Advanced Model Predictive Control Method Based on Discrete Space Vector Modulation for Reduced Switch Counts Three-Level Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10691887</link><description>The existing model predictive control (MPC) method effectively suppresses common mode voltage (CMV) of the reduced switch counts three-level converter (RSC-TLC), but it cannot properly deal with the problem of neutral point (NP) voltage balance, fixed switching frequency (FSF) and low current ripples simultaneously. To overcome these obstacles, in this article, an advanced MPC method based on discrete space vector modulation (DSVM) for the RSC-TLC is first proposed. First, to reduce the CMV of the RSC-TLC, the CMV amplitudes of all acting voltage vectors are limited to be less than one sixth of dc-link voltage. Second, based on the switching characteristics of the RSC-TLC and the principle of DSVM, numerous virtual vectors are introduced and served as candidates to track the reference current. Third, considering NP voltage balance, the proper switching sequences with adjustable switching time are adopted to output the optimal virtual vector, which has the smallest current tracking error. Consequently, NP voltage balance and FSF with reduced current ripples are achieved to improve current quality. Furthermore, only three candidate vectors are evaluated in each predictive step, which avoids evaluating extensive virtual vectors. Meanwhile, the coordinates of candidate vectors and the switching time for both coupled module and independent module are obtained by simple algebraic calculations under gh coordinate system, so that complex trigonometric functions are avoided. As a result, the proposed MPC method is computationally efficient. Finally, the simulation and experimental results verified feasibility and correctness of the proposed MPC method. Remarkably, for the proposed MPC method, the current harmonics are less than 4%, the CMV amplitude is reduced by 50% without significant increase of calculation burden compared with the conventional MPC method.</description></item><item><title>An Axial Split Phase Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor With Wide Constant Power Speed Range and High Efficiency Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10691889</link><description>In electrical vehicles (EVs), permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) should have wide constant power speed range (CPSR), wide high efficiency region and high fault tolerant capability. However, traditional PMSMs do not both have these two characteristics. The axial split phase (ASP) PMSM with high inductance and good fault tolerant performance has been proposed and received attention in electrical vehicles (EVs). However, its performances under the whole speed range are still unclear, which is very critical for PMSM in EVs. In this article, the performance of ASP-PMSM under the whole speed range are comprehensively studied. At first, the critical factors that influence the field-weakening performance are investigated. Then, the losses of ASP-PMSM at different operating conditions are analyzed and compared with that of fractional slot concentrated winding (FSCW) motor and integral slot distributed winding (ISDW) motor by theoretical analysis and finite element analysis (FEA). It is revealed that the ASP-PMSM both have high inductance and low loss at deep field-weakening region. At last, the loss and efficiency under the whole speed range are investigated carefully by FEA. It is verified that the investigated ASP-PMSM has the characteristics of wide CPSR and high efficiency region.</description></item><item><title>Robust Adaptive Prescribed-Time Tracking Control for Variable-Speed Wind Turbines Subject to Multiple Uncertainties</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10697381</link><description>To improve the annual generation capacity and assure the operational reliability for variable-speed wind turbines (VSWTs), this article solves a challenging issue in tracking the optimal tip speed ratio within the prescribed instant of time for extracting the maximum power. The obstacle is how to make the tracking error kept within predetermined time-varying constraint on the whole time-horizon under the impact of uncertainties and external disturbances and keep the angular discrepancy between the low-speed shaft and the high-speed shaft bounded. Utilizing a time-varying constraint function constructed with tracking accuracy and the prescribed-time, we devise a continuous robust adaptive controller by incorporating adaptive laws of unknown parameters with a composite function linked to the boundary constraints. Exceeding prior tracking performance of VSWTs, the proposed scheme is able to guide the tracking error into a predefined range within a prescribed instant of time in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances while guaranteeing the global boundedness of the signals in the closed-loop system. Finally, experimental verification is conducted to showcase the superiority/practicability of the constructed approach.</description></item><item><title>Fixed Switching Frequency Control Using Trapezoidal Current Mode to Achieve ZVS in Three-Level DC&#8211;DC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10691681</link><description>Generally, the variable switching frequency method is used to operate power converters in triangular current mode (TCM) or near critical conduction mode (CRM) to achieve zero-voltage switching (ZVS). However, this approach faces significant challenges: high peak inductor current, and complex controller design due to varied digital delays in variable frequency operation. To address these challenges, this article proposes a novel fixed switching frequency control method using trapezoidal current mode (TZCM) to mitigate the inductor peak current while realizing ZVS for three-level dc&#8211;dc converters. A relationship between the average inductor current and the two duty cycles is modeled to determine the appropriate trapezoidal current shape in near-CRM. By simultaneously adjusting two duty cycles and alternating them within each switching period, ZVS is successfully achieved at a fixed switching frequency. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed method not only improves the converter efficiency, especially at light loads, but also pioneers a fixed frequency scheme for achieving ZVS applicable to all three-level dc&#8211;dc converters. The proposed control is experimentally validated on a 2 kW prototype, achieving an efficiency of 99.12%.</description></item><item><title>An Online Converter-Level Wear-Out Failure Mode Separation Method for Power Semiconductor Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10702352</link><description>Wire-bonded power semiconductor devices have two main package related wear-out modes: bond-wires lift-off and solder joint degradation. It is of importance to separate them in an operating power converter, so that the degradation point can be localized and the wear-out procedures can be monitored separately. Consequently, it enables the optimization design of package and the development of more accurate lifetime model for power semiconductor devices. This article focuses on separating the main wear-out modes when power devices are in operation. It takes two points in the output I&#8211;V characteristic of power devices through a converter-level on-state voltage measurement circuit to realize the separation of wear-out modes for all power devices in a power converter. Compared with conventional methods, it is an on-line solution and applicable to different types of power device from the view of converter-level, resulting in much simplified implementation. Finally, the proposed method is demonstrated through a single-phase inverter case study to verify its feasibility and effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning-Based Condition Monitoring for DC-Link Capacitors in AC/DC/AC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10695772</link><description>Power electronic converters play a pivotal role in diverse industries. Yet, reliability of these converters has been a critical concern since its early applications. Thus, this article proposes a machine learning (ML)-based condition monitoring (CM) system for dc-link capacitors (DLCs) in ac/dc/ac converters. The capacitance of DLC is chosen as the health indicator, and the power spectral density (PSD) of dc-link voltage ripple is proposed as a diagnostic tool. This technique offers resilience against measurement noise and eliminates the necessity for additional filtering techniques. Moreover, the proposed method does not require a high sampling frequency unlike the similar studies. Another notable advantage of this approach is that no additional circuitry is required, as it solely relies on the available signals. Moreover, the effectiveness of the ML-based CM system is evaluated through simulation results and an experimental validation on a laboratory prototype. The experimental results pointed out the high accuracy of the proposed CM system.</description></item><item><title>DC-to-5-MHz Wide-Output-Bandwidth High-Power High-Fidelity Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693936</link><description>Advances in power electronics have made it possible to achieve high-power levels, e.g., reaching GW in grids, or alternatively high output bandwidths, e.g., beyond MHz in communications. Achieving both simultaneously, however, remains challenging. Various applications, ranging from efficient multichannel wireless power transfer to cutting-edge medical and neuroscience applications, demand both high power and wide bandwidth. Conventional inverters can achieve high power and high quality at grid or specific frequency ranges but lose their fidelity when reaching higher output frequencies. Resonant circuits can yield a high output frequency but only a narrow bandwidth. We overcome these hardware challenges by combining gallium-nitride (GaN) transistors with modular cascaded double-H bridge circuits and control that can manage typical timing and balancing issues. We developed a compact embedded control solution that includes an improved look-up-table digital synthesizer and a novel adaptive-bias-elimination nearest-level modulation. This solution effectively solves the conflict between a high power level and high output bandwidth and can, in principle, be scaled in both dimensions, in contrast to previous approaches. Our prototype exhibits a frequency range from dc to 5 MHz with less than 18% total voltage distortion across the entire frequency spectrum while achieving a power level of 5 kVA. We demonstrated applications of the system by sweeping the output frequency and two channel-mixing trials, which included a practical magnetogenetics-oriented stimulation pulse as well as a communications message example.</description></item><item><title>A Three Degrees of Freedom Structured Resonant Galvanometer for Noninvasive Passive High-Sensitivity Monitoring</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693947</link><description>This article mainly develops a kind of three degrees of freedom (DOF) structured resonant galvanometer (abbreviated as 3DS-RGM) with high sensitivity, as a new solution to the challenge of sensor nodes for ac current monitoring. The developed 3DS-RGM is typically comprised of three coupled magnetic cantilevers, given differentiated magnetic characteristics. When ac current is applied, the detecting cantilever, any of the side ones, subjected to the maximum magnetic force, passively outputs a large amplitude signal. A passive ac current sensing theory is proposed and demonstrated by fabricating a three-cantilever prototype. A high sensitivity, up to 0.624 V/A, is experimentally obtained with an increase to 1.5 times compared to that of single DOF structured resonant galvanometer. The observed output increase in the detecting cantilever is discussed and analyzed from the viewpoint of the energy transfer contributed by the other two sensing ones. The sensitivity of the developed 3DS-RGM can be further improved by combining with other known schemes for realizing both passive and non-invasive measurement of sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) applicable to industrial fields such as frequency conversion equipment and smart grid.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Wind Power Forecasting Based on the Strategy of &#8220;Dynamic Matching and Online Modeling&#8221;</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620613</link><description>Ultra-short-term wind power forecasting plays a vital role in real-time scheduling, frequency regulation, and intraday market transactions. Due to the complexity of weather systems, unit aging, wind farm control strategies, etc., the temporal dependency relationship in wind power series changes from time to time (known as concept drift), which leads to the low forecasting accuracy of the commonly used offline modeling methods. Online modeling can effectively deal with concept drift by utilizing the latest information in the flow data and capturing the latest concepts during the modeling process. However, the existing online modeling methods cannot meet the timeliness requirements of the power grid for ultra-short-term wind power forecasting. Therefore, a strategy of &#8220;dynamic matching and online modeling&#8221; for ultra-short-term wind power forecasting is proposed in this paper. Training samples are dynamically selected according to the characteristic similarity of amplitude and fluctuation, aiming to improve the representativeness of samples and reduce the training time simultaneously. In addition to historical power, Numerical Weather Prediction wind speed is also introduced in the process of &#8220;dynamic matching&#8221; to improve the forecasting accuracy. Operation data from three wind farms in China is used to validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The results show that the forecasting accuracy can be improved by 1.18%&#8211;4.32% for 4 hours in advance.</description></item><item><title>Resilience-Oriented Two-Stage Restoration Considering Coordinated Maintenance and Reconfiguration in Integrated Power Distribution and Heating Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10620409</link><description>The inherent linkage between a power distribution system (PDS) and a district heating system (DHS) necessitates coordinated load restoration after natural disasters. To guarantee optimal load restoration during a recovery process, a coordinated dispatch strategy of the maintenance crew for the PDS/DHS considering the optimal reconfiguration of their respective networks is proposed in this paper. The proposed solution focuses on the intricate mutual interaction of the DHS and PDS and coordinates the fault isolation and service restoration stages. The proposed optimization is modeled as a mixed-integer second-order cone problem (MISOCP), which contains numerous integer variables. To lessen the computational burden, a two-stage acceleration algorithm is proposed, which divides the solution procedure into two stages based on two types of integer variables: load status variables and variables associated with the maintenance path and network topology. Then, the acceleration principles are proposed to determine the load status variables. The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model are validated by extensive cases, which demonstrate the performance of the coordinated maintenance and reconfiguration in integrated energy systems for fault recovery.</description></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Control Strategy for F-SOP Considering Three-Phase Imbalance and Economic Operation in ISLDN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638221</link><description>With the increasing integration of renewable energy sources (RES) and single-phase loads, three-phase imbalance and transformer lightly/heavily loaded operation issues has become more prominent in low-voltage distribution networks (LDN). However, existing research on interconnected systems of LDN (ISLDN) rarely addresses the comprehensive management of both three-phase imbalance and lightly/heavily loaded operation issues. To this end, a comprehensive control strategy for three-phase imbalance and lightly/heavily loaded operation in ISLDN based on a four-leg soft open point (F-SOP) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the comprehensive loss characteristics model of ISLDN including the F-SOP and the transformer are established, revealing that both imbalance and load rate can affect the equipment efficiency. Secondly, considering the objective of minimizing power loss, an optimization dispatch strategy with constraints of three-phase imbalance and the optimal economic operation area is proposed to obtain the dispatch power commands for the F-SOP. Furthermore, an improved peer-to-peer control for F-SOP is proposed to ensure the conduct of the optimization dispatch strategy and enhance stability performance of system. Finally, the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed comprehensive control strategy are validated by the simulations and experiments. The results show that comprehensive control of lightly/heavily loaded operation and three-phase imbalance in the ISLDN can significantly reduce daily power loss by 62%, improving system operation reliability and economy.</description></item><item><title>Graph-Based Large Scale Probabilistic PV Power Forecasting Insensitive to Space-Time Missing Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643410</link><description>In recent years, power systems integrated with distributed energy resources (DERs) have been considered to mitigate climate change. However, this makes power systems even more uncertain and complex, so uncertainty-aware accurate forecasting needs to be considered for the massive penetration of renewable energy. To this end, we propose a scalable and missing-insensitive framework for probabilistic multi-site photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting, specifically focused on large-scale PV sites and space-time missing data. By leveraging the graph neural network (GNN), the proposed scalable graph learning mechanism with random coarse graph attention and probabilistic spatio-temporal learning performs efficiently for large-scale PV sites in terms of forecasting accuracy and model training complexity. At the same time, our framework adaptively imputes the missing PV data in the space and time domain, respectively. Ablation study results demonstrate that our framework is effective for extracting complex spatial-temporal features across large-scale PV sites. Under extensive experiments, our framework shows 7$-$10% and 6$-$25% improvement on average for over 1600 PV sites and three types of space-time missing data, which ensures accurate and stable forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Dispatch Strategy for a Multi-Microgrid Cooperative Alliance Using a Two-Stage Pricing Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10648707</link><description>To coordinate resources among multi-level stakeholders and enhance the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into multi-microgrids, this study proposes an optimal dispatch strategy within a multi-microgrid cooperative alliance using a nuanced two-stage pricing mechanism. Initially, the strategy assesses electric energy interactions between microgrids and distribution networks to establish a foundation for collaborative scheduling. The two-stage pricing mechanism initiates with a leader-follower game, wherein the microgrid operator acts as the leader and users as followers. Subsequently, it adjusts EV tariffs based on the game's equilibrium, taking into account factors such as battery degradation and travel needs to optimize EVs' electricity consumption. Furthermore, a bi-level optimization model refines power interactions and pricing strategies across the network, significantly enhancing demand response capabilities and economic outcomes. Simulation results demonstrate that this strategy not only increases renewable energy consumption but also reduces energy costs, thereby improving the overall efficiency and sustainability of the system.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Optimization Operation of Improved Power-to-Hydrogen-and-Heat Method at Low Temperature for Reducing Carbon Emissions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654708</link><description>The power-to-hydrogen-and-heat (P2HH) method is a potential means of improving energy efficiency while reducing carbon emissions. However, existing P2HH methods are ineffective at low temperatures, and do not consider physical constraints on heat exchange between the electrolyzer and heating network. Hence, this paper proposes an improved P2HH (IP2HH) method to overcome these shortcomings. First, this paper proposes a novel collaborative mechanism between the electrolyzer and the heating network. In this system, the electrolyzer can not only transfer excess heat to the heating network when at high temperatures, but can also be heated by the heating network when at low temperatures. Second, this paper takes the physical limitations of heat exchange between electrolyzer and heating network into consideration, and models the regulating valve of heat exchanger. These considerations allow produce simulation results that better approximate real-world scenarios. Finally, a convex model integrated with the IP2HH approach is established. Compared with the existing P2HH method, the IP2HH method may allow electrolyzer to work intermittently based on fluctuations in renewables supplies while maintaining high hydrogen production efficiency. Such improvements could reduce carbon emissions by 35.5%, costs by 10.7%, and renewables curtailment by 26.4% at ambient temperature of 1 $^{\circ }$C.</description></item><item><title>Scheduling Multiple Industrial Electrolyzers in Renewable P2H Systems: A Coordinated Active-Reactive Power Management Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10654460</link><description>Utility-scale renewable power-to-hydrogen (ReP2H) systems typically consist of multiple electrolyzers (ELZs), many of which are powered by thyristor rectifiers (TRs). A TR-powered ELZ has a nonlinear and nondecouplable relation between its active and reactive loads. The on-off switching and load allocation across multiple ELZs impact the efficiency of P2H energy conversion and the active and reactive power flows in the electrical network. Improper scheduling may result in an excessive reactive load from the hydrogen plant, causing voltage violations and increased network losses, which compromise both safety and profitability. To address these issues, this paper first explores the tradeoffs between the energy efficiency and reactive loads of ELZs. Then, we propose a joint active-reactive power management method to coordinate the loads and thermal properties of the ELZs, renewables, energy storage, and var compensation to improve the overall productivity and profitability. Mixed-integer second-order cone programming (MISOCP) is established to achieve these goals, and a decomposition algorithm enables its applicability in large-scale systems. Case studies show that the proposed method, at best, increases the hydrogen yield by 2.49% while reducing network losses by 3.12% compared to the state-of-the-art strategies based on wind and solar power data from Inner Mongolia, China. The optimal var resource configuration for ReP2H systems is also briefly discussed.</description></item><item><title>Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning for Real-Time Optimal Power Flow With Renewable Energy Resources</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660524</link><description>The serious uncertainties from the extensive integration of renewable energy generations put forward a higher real-time requirement for power system dispatching. To provide economic and feasible generation operations in real-time, a physics-informed reinforcement learning (PIRL) method based on constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) for optimal power flow (OPF) is presented in this paper. In the proposed method, a physics-informed actor based on the power flow equations is designed to generate generation operations that satisfy the equality constraints of OPF. To specify inequality constraints in actor optimization, the policy gradient is augmented with the constraints to correct unfeasible generation operations. In particular, the cost functions related to inequality constraints can be directly calculated based on the output of the actor, which is more accurate than using networks to approximate in general CRL methods. The proposed method is tested on the IEEE 118-bus system, and the simulation result shows that the proposed method achieves a significant improvement in computation speed compared with the traditional interior point method while obtaining a similar generation cost.</description></item><item><title>Exploiting the Flexibility of District Heating System for Distribution System Operation: Set-Based Characterization and Temporal Decomposition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10660566</link><description>The proliferation of distributed renewable resources increases the uncertainty in distribution systems. Coupling the distribution system and district heating system helps leverage the flexibility of thermal storage and thus supports the operation of the electrical grid. This paper proposes a method to characterize flexibility from district heating system via polyhedral sets. First, a recursive robust feasibility condition that ensures heat supply adequacy under uncertain demand is established. Then, stagewise robust feasible sets of thermal storage levels are calculated using a customized projection algorithm. Finally, dynamic bounds of electric heaters are computed by a further projection step. With those dynamic bounds, the electric heaters behave like reducible loads, and the demands in each period are decoupled over time, although the dispatch of thermal storage units must comply with inter-temporal constraints. The proposed method allows the two coupled systems to be operated in a distributed way without forecasts and extensive communications. Numerical simulations on small and practically sized testing systems validate the advantage of the proposed method. On average, the set calculation takes about 8 minutes for the day-ahead problem and 11 seconds for real-time dispatch on a portable laptop, and the prediction-free operation policy has an average optimality gap of 3.6% compared to the hindsight optimum.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Volt-VAR Coordinated Scheduling With Mobile Energy Storage System for Active Distribution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10664000</link><description>In order to improve the voltage distribution and operation cost for ADN, A scheduling strategy is designed to integrate flexible resources, particularly mobile energy storage systems, within the coupling of ADN and TN, under an uncertain environment. A day-ahead Volt-VAR coordinated scheduling framework for ADN and TN can be proposed through incorporating a data-driven day-ahead scenario generation method based on denoising diffusion probabilistic model. First, the historical data may be employed to learn the error relationship between real power curves and predicted power curves for generating RES scenarios. The probability distribution for prediction error is constructed which can describe the day-ahead output power curve of RES. Subsequently, a SCCO approach is employed to measure voltage operating risk in uncertain environment, which can effectively utilize the controllability of different resource at timescale and spatial scale in ADN to fulfill the anticipated operational requirement. Finally, The ADN coupled with TN model can be linearized and converted into the mixed-integer linear programming method. Numerical simulations based on the IEEE 33-bus distribution system coupled with 15-node transportation network may verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Photovoltaic-Grid Integrated System for the Residential Power Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10663696</link><description>This paper proposes a photovoltaic (PV)-Utility integrated system with inductive power transfer (IPT) for electric vehicle (EV) charging applications in residential management applications. To realize this objective, a buck boost-interleaved H-bridge (BBIHB) configuration is proposed to integrate the PV source with the DC link of the front end converter (FEC) while achieving maximum power from the PV and power delivery to the IPT simultaneously. The DC bus of the IPT in the proposed system is obtained through the additive connection of the PV and FEC DC-link, which results in inherent boost of the DC bus voltage for the IPT system thus enhances the transmission power for the EV charging. Furthermore, the FEC allows bidirectional power flow between the utility and BBIHB converter by sharing the deficient or excess power in the system based on PV power availability. The complete modeling of the system and a control algorithm to achieve the above mentioned objectives is presented in this paper.

The conventional distributed cost optimization strategies use a communication system to converge incremental costs. However, these methods are dependent on the distributed communication network and do not consider frequency deviations for real-time load variability. Thus, this paper proposes a DRL-based dynamic droop control strategy. The proposed twin delayed DDPG-based DRL interacts with the environment to learn the optimal droop gain for reducing generation cost and frequency deviation. The trained agent uses local information to transmit dynamic droop gains to the primary controller as demand load changes. It can simplify the control structure by omitting the secondary layer for optimal operation and power quality. The proposed control strategy is designed with a centralized DRL training process and distributed execution, enabling real-time distributed optimal operation. The comparison results with conventional distributed strategy confirms better control performance of the proposed strategy. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed strategy was verified by experiment on AC microgrid testbed.</description></item><item><title>Cross-Timescale Interaction Analysis Between Current Control and Rotor Speed Control Timescale Dynamics in a High-Proportion DFIG-WT System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10665985</link><description>Power electronics (PE) equipment contains multiple timescale energy storage components and control loops. As a result, the dynamic process presents multiple timescale characteristics in PE-dominated power systems. For simplicity, single timescale dynamics are often the focus of corresponding analysis, and the influence of different timescales (i.e., cross-timescale analysis) is rarely considered. However, there is an interaction effect between multiple timescale controls and energy storage components, which complicates system dynamics. In this study, the cross-timescale impact of current control on the dynamics of rotor speed control timescale are evaluated. First, based on a two-machine two-area system comprising a phase-locked loop (PLL)-synchronized doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbine (WT), the influence of the PLL on cross-timescale interactions is revealed via modal analysis. Then, a current control equivalent circuit is derived for analyzing its cross-timescale influence on rotor motion, and the LC resonance mechanism related to the current control is revealed. Moreover, the impact of the PLL on cross-timescale interactions is elucidated. Finally, the cross-timescale influence phenomena and mechanisms are verified via real-time digital simulations.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Prediction of Wind Farm Cluster Power Based on Embedded Graph Structure Learning With Spatiotemporal Information Gain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669105</link><description>Ultra-short-term prediction of wind farm cluster power (UPWFCP) is of great significance for the development of intra-day power generation plan, and the power prediction accuracy is difficult to be further improved due to the chaotic effect of the weather system and the incompleteness of the information. In this regard, this paper proposes an embedded graph structure learning method for wind farm cluster (WFC) that incorporates spatiotemporal information gain (STIG) theory. The graph structure describing the spatiotemporal evolution relationship of information between wind farms (WFs) is constructed based on the spatiotemporal transfer relationship of power waveforms between WFs. An embedded graph attention network (EGAN) is proposed to learn STIG adjacency relationship among WFs, and a dynamic grouping scheme of redundant nodes in WFs based on STIG distance is constructed to reduce the modeling complexity. The proposed method is applied to the WFC of Inner Mongolia, China, and the results show that the NRMSE, NMAE, and MAPE of the proposed method are on average 2.63%, 2.09%, and 20.95% lower, and the R2 and Pr are on average 7.66% and 6.64% higher, respectively, compared with the rest of the comparison methods at all time scales.</description></item><item><title>Integrating Air-Source Heat Pumps into the Demand-Side Fast Frequency Response Service: A Study Based on Thermal Dynamic Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10669175</link><description>Fast frequency response services, designed to quickly balance the electrical grid within seconds, have a critical importance for managing sudden anomalies in low-inertia power systems. Battery systems often serve as versatile prosumers on the demand side to facilitate fast frequency response services. However, the nature of fast frequency response services leads to a highly fluctuating power profile for batteries, which can shorten their lifetime. In contrast, distributed air-source heat pumps in residential areas have a substantial untapped potential to support fast frequency response services. This paper seeks to integrate them into the existing services through a controller upgrade. We analyze the influence of air-source heat pumps' inherent complex thermal dynamics on fast frequency response services, revealing control challenges posed by unpredictable operating condition changes. Such a challenge is tackled with a standard droop control structure which is tuned through ${{H}_\infty }$ method, guaranteeing practical and stable operations within the permitted operating condition range. Finally, the proposed fast frequency response service scheme is tested through multiphysics simulations on a small-size low-inertia residential microgrid. The obtained results strongly supported the proposed new service.</description></item><item><title>Globally Optimal Distributed Operation of Integrated Electric and Heating Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10677480</link><description>Unit commitment (UC) is a key player in the coordinated operation of integrated energy systems. However, the participation of multiple market entities with widely different characteristics in large-scale energy systems has urged the critical need for the application of a distributed scheme to the UC problem. The NP-hard UC problem is a challenging mixed-integer programming problem. The presence of a large number of binary variables in the UC subproblems, which are solved by each participating entity after implementing the UC decomposition, fails to guarantee the convergence and the optimality of existing solution methods. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a distributed method, using logic-based Benders decomposition (LBBD), for the UC problem in a typical multi-entity system, i.e., integrated electric and heating system (IEHS). By searching the branch and bound tree of the district heating system (DHS) subproblem, the lower bound of its objective function is rigorously derived as a valid Benders cut to ensure the convergence to global optimal results. This distributed method is suitable for both deterministic and robust UC solutions. Numerical simulations are conducted on two test systems to demonstrate the performance of the proposed model and its distributed solution method.</description></item><item><title>Set-Valued Regression of Wind Power Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10678875</link><description>Precise wind power curves are pivotal for monitoring the status of wind turbines and predicting wind power, which are important parts of utilizing wind energy in power systems. However, the data sets for training wind power curve models have a critical issue. A considerable proportion of the data sets is abnormal due to communication failure and other factors. Using the data sets with abnormal data will significantly deteriorate the fitting performance. This paper resolves the above issue by proposing a unified way to achieve abnormal data detection and curve fitting. Instead of regression with scalar output, set-valued regression of the wind power curve is considered, giving a set of wind power for a given wind speed. Interval neural network is adopted as the model for set-valued regression. A chance-constrained optimization problem is formulated to train an interval neural network. The obtained interval neural network can specify a subset with the normal data area, which can be used to give the threshold for abnormal data detection. Besides, the center points of the interval can be used as the fitted wind power curve. Since the formulated chance-constrained optimization problem is intractable, a sample-based sigmoidal approximation method is proposed to approximately solve it. The convergence and probabilistic feasibility of the approximation are given. Finally, experimental validations have been conducted to compare the proposed method with several existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Preserving Normal Power Curve Data With Sparse Density via Wind Speed-Power Correlation Trend Cleaning Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10678883</link><description>Stochastic wind conditions and curtailment lead to a sparse distribution of normal data compared to outliers on the Wind Power Curve (WPC). This results in the removal of sparse normal data during the data cleaning process, hampering short-term wind power assessment and forecasting. To address this issue, this paper proposes a decision boundary construction method that utilizes the wind speed-power correlation trend to retain normal WPC data. First, leveraging the positive correlation between wind speed and power, an incremental trend search strategy is used to obtain the trend curve. Building on this curve, a scatter motion trend algorithm is introduced to eliminate densely clustered curtailed power data. Finally, a kernel function-based 3-sigma boundary construction method is suggested to further reduce the influence of remaining clustered outliers on decision boundaries. The proposed method is compared to eight advanced algorithms using data from 17 wind turbines across three wind farms, demonstrating superior performance, especially in scenarios with sparse normal data.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Inertial Control for Wind Turbine Generators in Fast Frequency Response Based on the Power Reduction Period Assessment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10678806</link><description>Fast frequency response of wind turbine generators (WTGs) is achieved by injecting incremental power to the grid followed by power reductions to avoid over-deceleration and ensure secure rotor speed recovery. Second frequency deeps (SFDs) are the results of such power reductions that are challenging during abrupt frequency transients that may lead to under-frequency load shedding, or cascading events leading to blackouts. To address this issue, this paper presents an adaptive inertial control (AIC) scheme for WTGs designed to maximize the improvement in frequency nadir without causing SFD. The proposed method is developed through an assessment of power reduction period of WTGs during fast frequency response. This analysis investigates the impacts on the system frequency of a) injecting different shares of disturbance size (SoDSs) by WTGs and b) latency/delay in power injection. Derived from this analysis, the AIC is proposed to inject the maximum possible SoDS during the over-production period and successfully stabilize and recover the rotor speed during the assigned optimal power reduction period with SFDs disabled. This is achieved by adaptively adjusting the AIC in the reduction period based on the SoDS injected by WTGs during the over-production stage. Also, the AIC is modified to adapt against wind speed deviations. To evaluate the performance of the AIC, a comprehensive verification is carried out by comparing AIC with thirteen existing inertial control schemes and maximum power point tracking control in various cases using wind-integrated IEEE 39-bus system in Digsilent PowerFactory and real-time experimental tests. The results confirm the effectiveness of AIC in terms of achieving maximum improvement in frequency nadir without generating SFD.</description></item><item><title>Causal Mechanism-Enabled Zero-Label Learning for Power Generation Forecasting of Newly-Built PV Sites</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10679087</link><description>Power forecasting of newly built photovoltaic (PV) sites faces huge challenges owing to the lack of sufficient training samples. To this end, this paper proposes an unsupervised zero-label learning method for power generation forecasting of newly built PV sites without relying on any historical power output data. The main idea is to extract invariant causal structures across different PV sites and leverage this causality to enhance the power forecasting performance on the newly built ones. In particular, a causality-enabled domain adaptation network (CEDAN) is designed to capture the causal mechanism of PV generation from the multiple fine-grain segments of time-lagged data. It relaxes the causal relationships to an associative structure which is further concretized as attention score vectors through the designed intra- and inter-variable attention mechanisms. To quantify the distribution discrepancies between source and target domain causal structures, a specific domain adaptation loss function is designed for the optimization of CEDAN. It is further extended to a domain adaptation quantile loss to handle the uncertainties of PV power output. By jointly minimizing the domain adaptation loss and power forecasting error/conditional quantile loss, an invariant power generation causal mechanism across data domains for a newly built PV site can be learned. This allows the proposed method to achieve accurate and highly generalized power generation forecasting for newly built PV sites without relying on labeled data. Extensive experiments utilizing real PV generation data demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art transfer learning methods by 7.57% at least in deterministic forecasting and 8.37% at least in probabilistic forecasting.</description></item><item><title>Startup Control of Grid-Forming Offshore Wind Turbines Connected to the Diode-Rectifier-Based HVDC Link</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10680154</link><description>The Diode-Rectifier (DR) based HVDC has been considered as an economical solution to connect remote offshore wind turbines (WTs) to the onshore power grid. However, the DR is a passive device and cannot support the startup of the WTs. Therefore, it is worth finding an appropriate and cost-effective startup strategy for the DR-connected WTs. This paper investigates to use of wind energy to startup those WTs to avoid the need for additional grid support or the energy storage system, which can reduce the overall cost of such transmission system. The first challenge for this strategy is that the output active power of WTs can be extremely low during the startup process, which puts the WT rotor at a high risk of overspeed. Another challenge is to prevent power surges between synchronizing WTs. To address those issues, the pitch control has been innovated for the DR-connected WTs. In addition, a seamless synchronization control of the DR-connected WTs is proposed, which does not need the phase-locked-loop and can facilitate the whole startup process of the DR-connected WTs. The feasibility of these proposed control strategies for the startup of the DR-connected WTs is verified by comprehensive simulation studies.</description></item><item><title>Reliability-Based Planning of Cable Layout for Offshore Wind Farm Electrical Collector System Considering Post-Fault Network Reconfiguration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681539</link><description>The electrical collector system (ECS) plays a crucial role in determining the performance of offshore wind farms (OWFs). Existing research has predominantly restricted ECS cable layouts to conventional radial or ring structures and employed graph theory heuristics for solutions. However, both economic efficiency and reliability of the OWFs heavily depend on their ECS structure, and the optimal ECS cable layout often deviates from typical configurations. In this context, this paper introduces a novel reliability-based ECS cable layout planning method for large-scale OWFs, employing a two-stage stochastic programming approach to address uncertainties of wind power and contingencies. To enhance reliability, the model incorporates optimal post-fault network reconfiguration strategies by adjusting wind turbine power supply paths through link cables. To tackle computation challenges arising from numerous contingency scenarios, a customized progressive contingency incorporation (CPCI) framework is developed to solve the model with higher efficiency by iteratively identifying non-trivial scenarios and solving the simplified problems. The convergence and optimality are theoretically proven. Numerical tests on several real-world OWFs validate the necessity of fully optimizing ECS structures and demonstrate the efficiency of the CPCI algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Transient Interaction Mechanism Analysis and Stability Control of Multi-Paralleled DFIG-Based WTs During Asymmetrical Grid Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681307</link><description>In this article, from the perspective of DC-link voltage (DCV) control, the transient interaction mechanism of multi-paralleled doubly fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind turbines (WTs) is investigated during asymmetrical grid faults. Firstly, considering the coupling characteristics of positive and negative sequence (PNS) components and the interaction characteristics between the rotor side converter (RSC) and grid side converter (GSC), a large-signal nonlinear model of multiple-parallel DFIG-based WTs in DC-link voltage control time-scale is obtained. Furthermore, by using the energy function method, the dynamic interaction mechanism of multiple-parallel DFIG-based WTs is analyzed. The influence of different parameters on the transient characteristics of DC-link voltage is analyzed by using phase trajectory diagram. The dominant factors affecting the transient stability of the WTs and stability level of DC-link voltage are obtained. In addition, considering the interaction among WTs, the dynamic interaction between RSC and GSC, as well as the requirement of grid codes, a transient stability optimization strategy during asymmetrical grid faults is proposed to improve the transient stability level of the DC-link voltage and the transient stability of multiple-parallel DFIG-based WTs. Finally, simulation and experimental results validate the correctness of theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Reactive Power Optimization for Flexible Distribution Networks With Successive Relaxation Iteration Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10682812</link><description>The flexible soft open point (SOP) connected to active distribution networks (ADNs) offers a promising manner of improving voltage and VAR control (VVC) by providing flexible power regulation. Due to the expansion of interconnective networks, the centralized optimization method has recently faced various challenges. This paper thus proposes a novel distributed coordinated reactive power optimization strategy for SOP-based multiregional ADNs based on local model decoupling and iterative interactions. By applying the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), the centralized VVC optimization problem is divided into several subproblems, allowing each area to optimize its local subproblem in a fully distributed manner. Multiple resources are thereby coordinated by the VVC, including both discrete and continuous devices. To ensure computability of both integer and non-convex problems, the relaxation iteration and successive linear approximation methods are nested to the ADMM framework, within this approach to allow ready solution to the distributed VVC optimization problem to be generated using a relaxation iterative algorithm, which significantly improves algorithm convergence and computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in this work using a modified IEEE standard interconnection system.</description></item><item><title>Fast Power Regulation Method During System Restoration for D-PMSG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10685139</link><description>The speed of the pitch action is one of the primary constraints that limit the power ramp rate of wind turbines (WTs). By storing kinetic energy (KE) within the wind wheel, blades, and generator rotor, the output power of the WT can be regulated more rapidly with less pitch action. This capability is beneficial in specific situations where additional power injection is required by the external system, such as during the system restoration process after a blackout. In this paper, a novel fast power regulation method for direct-drive PMSG-based (D-PMSG-based) WTs is proposed. This method allows for the early completion of the most time-consuming pitch reduction process and ensures that KE can be stored within the WT before the external system becomes available. As a result, the WT will be able to achieve maximum power output before the system restoration is fully completed. The potential operation boundary and the maximum external power support capability of D-PMSG-based WTs are analyzed. By following the operation boundary, converter modulation problem caused by high KE reserve can be avoided. The proposed fast power regulation method can significantly reduce the power increase speed and maximize the output power capability of D-PMSG-base WTs.</description></item><item><title>Research on PV Hosting Capacity of Distribution Networks Based on Data-Driven and Nonlinear Sensitivity Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693542</link><description>Voltage calculations are critical for assessing photovoltaic hosting capacity; however, acquiring precise parameters and the topology of the medium voltage distribution networks poses a significant challenge, thereby rendering traditional power flow computational methods ineffective. To address this issue, this paper introduces a hybrid method that utilizes a data-driven approach in conjunction with nonlinear functions to determine node voltages. Firstly, a deep neural network model for distribution network's power flow and voltage-power sensitivity analysis is established using historical data. This model captures the data-driven error, which reduces time consumption and increases accuracy. Secondly, a fourth-order Taylor expansion of power to voltage is derived based on the power flow mathematical equation to extrapolate voltage. This is necessary because when photovoltaic generators are connected to the nodes, the load data often exceeds the historical data range, rendering neural networks inapplicable. Finally, the sparrow search algorithm is employed to determine the hosting capacity. The proposed methods are validated using IEEE 33 and IEEE 69 case systems, demonstrating that the data-driven approach, combined with nonlinear functions, can ensure the accuracy in obtaining node voltage and the hosting capacity.</description></item><item><title>Analytical Evaluation to Power System Oscillation Damping Capability of DFIG-POD Based on Path Damping Torque Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693531</link><description>The increasing wind power decreases power system damping and may intensify low-frequency oscillation (LFO). The LFO are usually damped by the power system stabilizer (PSS) at synchronous generator (SG), and now by the power oscillation damper (POD) at doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG). The existing damping torque analysis (DTA) sets the parameters of the PSS and evaluates its damping capability, but can not be applied to the POD due to the difficulty of finding the damping path related to the DFIG and the coupling between the POD and the DFIG, which are studied in this paper. At first, the analytical expression of the coupling between the POD and DFIG is newly derived with linear fractional transformation (LFT) technique. Then the path damping torque analysis (PDTA) is proposed to reconstruct the damping path of the POD. Thirdly, the damping indicator based on the return difference matrix is proposed to evaluate the contribution of damping path to the LFO. Finally, numerical results of test system are given to validate effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed model, and parameter optimization to the multi-input POD (MIPOD) is performed to show the application value of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Spatiotemporal Adversarial Domain Generalization for Locating Subsynchronous Oscillation Sources Under Unseen Conditions in Large-Scale Renewable Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693450</link><description>Subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs) in renewable power systems have emerged as a major challenge, jeopardizing the stability and safety of power system operations. Thus, it is essential to accurately and timely locate SSO sources. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods for locating SSO sources have become increasingly popular, existing AI-based methods usually fail in practical applications due to unavailable or insufficient real-world SSO data for model training, and significant distribution gaps in samples under different operational conditions. They also fail to fully utilize the temporal characteristics of oscillations and the spatial topology of the system. Moreover, these methods only focus on locating either negative-damping-SSO or forced-SSO sources. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel strategy termed Spatiotemporal-Adversarial-Domain-Generalization (STADG) to locate oscillation sources in both SSO scenarios of real power systems. This method allows the model to train on multi-source domains (simplified-simulation power systems) with sufficient labeled samples, and to be directly applied to an unseen test target domain (real power system) under unknow operating conditions. The proposed approach employs a graph-attention network and a long-short-term-memory network to fully leverage spatial and temporal features of SSOs. Extensive experiments on the modified IEEE-39 and WECC-179 bus systems confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Two-Level Distributed Consensus Control of Multiple Wind Farms for Fast Frequency Support</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10694712</link><description>The neighboring wind farms have great frequency support potential. The wind turbine generators (WTGs) in these wind farms are influenced by wake effects and have different frequency support capabilities. In order to fully utilize the WTGs' support capabilities under different operating states, this paper proposes a two-level distributed consensus (TLDC) control to cooperate all the WTGs. Level I is leader-follower control, which is equipped within the wind farms. Level II is leaderless control which is used among the wind farms. This method is able to assign different values of power commands to different WTGs in the system to achieve better frequency support effect and stability. Based on MATLAB/Simulink and Opal-RT real-time simulation platforms, the two-area power system and Guangshui system (100% renewable energy power system) are analyzed, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed TLDC method has a better effect compared with other frequency support methods. It can also flexibly respond to communication interruptions and delays.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Stage Integrated Transmission and Distribution Expansion Planning Under Uncertainties With Smart Investment Options</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10694803</link><description>The shift towards a decentralized paradigm in power systems in response to decarbonization and deregulation efforts necessitates stronger coordination between transmission and distribution operators for cost-effective operation and planning. However, long-term uncertainties in the transition to net-zero are posing major challenges for decision-making. Moreover, literature has traditionally focused on the transmission and distribution expansion planning problems independently, as is customary in industry, leading to a lack of sophisticated integrated planning methods and inefficient expansion decisions in practice. This paper proposes a novel multi-stage stochastic programming framework for the integrated transmission and active distribution networks expansion planning under multi-dimensional uncertainties. Infrastructure investments are co-optimized with non-network alternatives with diverse techno-economic characteristics to support flexible planning. To manage the increased computational complexities, a machine learning-assisted multi-cut Benders decomposition approach is implemented. The case studies firstly highlight the strategic and economic advantages of the proposed multi-stage formulation, and then demonstrate the significant role and value of smart investment options in managing uncertainty. Lastly, the application of the proposed model on a study involving a 229-bus test system and 18 long-term scenarios validates its scalability and practical applicability.</description></item><item><title>Interaction Modeling and Stability Analysis of Grid-Forming Energy Storage System Based on SISO Transfer Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10700987</link><description>With the rapid expansion of photovoltaic (PV), grid-forming energy storage systems (GFM-ESS) have been widely employed for inertia response and voltage support to enhance the dynamic characteristics. Converters with different synchronization methods represent significant differences in dynamic behavior. The interactions between grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) devices with multi-time scale control may lead to small-signal instability in hybrid systems. This paper investigates a grid-connected system comprising a grid-forming energy storage system and a grid-following PV system (GFL-PV). Based on single-input-single-output (SISO) transfer functions, a dynamic interaction model for the PV-ESS system is established. Combining the open-loop transfer functions of full-loop and sub-loop, the proposed model reveals how GFM-ESS modifies the dynamic characteristics of GFL-PV under weak grid conditions. Subsequently, the impact of different control loops and parameters on the small-signal stability of the system is analyzed. The stability margins of both devices are also compared through the SISO model. Electromagnetic transient simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink and experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed models and analyses.</description></item><item><title>Impedance Characteristic Analysis and Phase-Locked Angle Feedforward-Based Stability Improvement for LCC-HVDC in Sending AC Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10704965</link><description>With the increasing penetration of wind power, the line-commutated converter-based high-voltage direct-current (LCC-HVDC) system in sending AC grid faces a potential risk of sub/super-synchronous oscillations (SSSOs), which threatens the stability of the power system. The impedance-based method is an effective way to analyze and suppress the SSSOs. However, since the effects of each control part in LCC-HVDC on the stability of sending AC grid are not yet well-investigated, there is a lack of theoretical guidance for implementing the impedance reshaping strategy for LCC-HVDC. Therefore, this paper establishes and analyzes the modular impedance model of LCC-HVDC, to elucidate the contribution of each control part and the interaction between different control loops. On this basis, an impedance reshaping strategy based on phase-locked angle feedforward (PAF) is proposed to improve system stability by attenuating the interaction. Compared to the existing virtual impedance-based method, the proposed PAF-based method addresses its possible failure in suppressing the SSSOs of sending AC grid. The theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the aforementioned conclusions and the effectiveness of the proposed impedance reshaping strategy.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Operation Flexibility in Modular Power to Hydrogen Based Ammonia Industries</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10706701</link><description>Modularization of Hydrogen Electrolyzers (HEs) is projected to be immediate, resilient, and efficient for load management in large-scale Hydrogen Consuming Industries (HCIs). It offers a scalable and flexible solution that can adapt to changes in hydrogen and power system demands. However, Modular HEs are studied primarily as small-scale wind hydrogen systems only, converting excess Renewable Energy (RE) into hydrogen without the integration of rigid downstream operations. Downstream constraints in HCIs, like rigid hydrogen demands, device operational/ramping limits, and storage constraints, can limit or regulate modular HE's use for power system services. Furthermore, oversimplified HE operational modeling within HCIs leads to suboptimal outcomes for integrated modular HCI and RE-rich power system (RPS) operations, resulting in RE curtailments and inaccurate flexibility estimations. This happens due to improper loading rates arising from unrealistic inter and intra-modular HE operations. This work proposes a comprehensive model for modular HE management in integrated ammonia (HCI) and power systems for flexibility in sector-coupled scenarios. The work considers and demonstrates how downstream constraints regulate HEs flexibility through a unit commitment problem framework. HE operations with detailed and extended electrochemical dynamics are considered to improve and enhance operational flexibility calculations of growing RPS-based modular HCIs. This allows for better sectoral integration and estimation of power system services.</description></item><item><title>An Overvoltage-Averse Model for Renewable-Rich AC/DC Distribution Networks Considering the Sensitivity of Voltage Violation Probability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709908</link><description>The increasing renewable generation increase the probability of voltage violation. The spatial and temporal power transfer can be achieved in AC/DC distribution networks based on voltage source converters (VSCs) and energy storage (ES), which can effectively avoid system voltage violation. However, the existing voltage violation mitigation methods in uncertain scenarios are either limited by the long solution time or complex modeling, which are difficult to meet the overvoltage probability reduction requirements of intra-day dispatch. In addition, the power transfer will simultaneously affect interconnected systems because the power is coupled through the VSCs. Overvoltage probability reduction on one line may lead to an increase on the other. This paper proposes a two-stage overvoltage-averse model considering the sensitivity of voltage violation probability. The proposed method analytically depicts the impact of power adjustment on the system overvoltage probability. The day-ahead optimization model is established as chance-constrained model. The intra-day optimization model is established as a quadratic convex model, which can be efficiently solved. Simulation results verify that the method proposed can effectively achieve the overvoltage probability reduction of renewable-rich AC/DC distribution networks.</description></item><item><title>A Mimicking-Avoiding Short-Term Probabilistic Power Forecasting Method for Wave Energies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10709879</link><description>Wave energy is essential for sustainable marine development. However, complex marine weather conditions cause fluctuating wave power outputs, resulting in a mimicking phenomenon in predictions. Moreover, the lack of accurate numerical weather prediction (NWP) data sources aggravates the prediction inaccuracy. To address these obstacles, a series characteristic perception (SCP) method coordinated with an advanced hybrid model, the quantile liberty loss gated recurrent unit kernel density estimation (QLB-GRU-KDE), is proposed for the floating point absorber wave energy system. In the first stage, the SCP method gains prior knowledge via ensemble approaches. In the second stage, a liberty loss function is used to mitigate the mimicking phenomenon. Furthermore, a hybrid model that integrates a GRU and KDE is adopted for the probabilistic forecasting of wave energy generation. In addition, a metric is proposed to evaluate the severity of the mimicking. A case study based on a real-world wave dataset is conducted, where both deterministic and probabilistic prediction approaches are examined. Comparisons with the cutting-edge counterparts reveal that the designed liberty loss effectively mitigates the mimicking issue. The comprehensive performance of the proposed model, including the accuracy, stability, reliability and sharpness in wave power prediction, is validated by multiple metrics.</description></item><item><title>Approximate Optimal Energy Management of Thermal-HESS System for MIMO Fuzzy Logic Controller Based AGC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10710156</link><description>Compared to one-type of energy storage device, hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) offer benefits for Auto generation control (AGC) command tracking and can reduce investment in energy storage. Traditional control method, although effective in meeting the matching of AGC commands at a specific moment, often lacks coordination across multiple time intervals, resulting in frequent and irregular charging/ discharging which reduces the overall lifetime. To address this, this paper presents an approximate optimal operation strategy for Thermal-HESS system, aiming to enhance the AGC performance of the generating unit and improve the energy management capability of the HESSs. Firstly, an auto-adjust Markov Chain prediction method is proposed to forecast the power demand of the AGC command tracking to determine power demand's tendency. Secondly, a stochastic model predictive control (SMPC)-based optimal model, which considers the current step and cost-to-go function, is proposed. However, the SMPC based model is multiple-step optimal operational problem, which will increase the computational burden of the controller. Therefore, this paper further designs a Multiple-Input-Multiple-output (MIMO) fuzzy logic controller to approximate the optimal alternative to the cost-to-go function of SMPC model, meeting the computational and application requirements more effectively. Finally, numerical case studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in AGC command tracking and HESSs energy management.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Resilience of Urban Electric-Road-Metro Interdependent Network Considering Electric Bus Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10711253</link><description>With the increasing electrification of urban transportation, urban power and traffic systems are highly coupled and influence each other, leading to a challenge for the post-event resilience enhancement of urban electric-traffic interdependent network (ETIN). In this context, we propose a multi-layer electric-metro-road interdependent network where the metro network (MN) depends on the distribution power network (DPN) and interacts with the road traffic network (RTN) synchronously. Electric buses (EBs), as one public dispatchable resource, are considered and explored to provide bridging routes for disabled MNs and supply power for failed DPNs, with consideration of three different service trips, i.e., the original trip, bridging trip, and charge-discharge trip. On this basis, a spatio-temporal network-based EB route schedule model is constructed. To consider the evacuation demand of affected MN routes, a fast DPN restoration strategy is proposed to minimize the time cost of lost load by integrating the network reconfiguration with the collaborative allocation of repair crews (RCs) and EBs. Finally, a distributed method is further devised for the coordination among different stakeholders. The proposed method is verified on two electric-traffic systems to show that the collaborative scheduling of RCs and EBs can effectively enhance the resilience of ETIN under metro service disruptions.</description></item><item><title>An Integrated Sparse Gated Graph Density Network Based on Transfer Learning for Multi-Site Probabilistic Forecasting of Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10714034</link><description>Large-scale new energy grid-connected poses significant challenges to the safe and efficient operation of smart grids. Renewable energy probabilistic forecasting (REPF) technology can analyze uncertainties in power generation, quantitatively balance risks, and prevent the breakdown of the grid. However, current REPF methods reliant on spatio-temporal maps fail to accurately estimate the probability density function (PDF) of renewable energy, resulting lacking comprehensive uncertainty analysis for distributed power generation systems (DPGS). To fill this gap, in this study, an integrated sparse gated graph density network (ISGGDN) that incorporates transfer learning to tackle the REPF challenge. A sparse gated graph dynamic convolutional network based on cross attention and residual connection is developed, which can effectively extract spatial features and spatio-temporal interactions between sites and improve the accuracy of probabilistic prediction. Furthermore, to effectively identify the types of features lost during the transfer process and to enhance the transfer learning (TL) capability, we developed an integrated approach involving multiple fine-tuning strategies based on TL. We evaluated the proposed model using wind and photovoltaic (PV) power generation data from two neighboring multi-sites, and the experimental results demonstrate that ISGGDN outperforms other existing solutions in terms of accuracy and effectiveness in REPF.</description></item><item><title>Aggregating Large-Scale Residential Users for Regulation Reserve Provision: Truthful Combinatorial Auction Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715698</link><description>The proliferation of flexible loads has empowered residential users in contributing both upward and downward frequency regulation reserves to the power grid. Due to barriers like minimum bid size, residential users with relatively small power consumption must be aggregated before they can enter the reserve market. However, the large number of residential users renders the aggregation mechanism design problem a challenging task. In particular, the cost for reserve provision of each user is not only highly heterogeneous, but also coupled through both the temporal dimension and the up/down regulation direction. In order to allow the users to fully express their costs, in this paper, we propose a combinatorial reverse auction (CRA) framework as the market mechanism for user aggregation. In this auction, the aggregator is the auctioneer and procures reserves from residential users. The users submit package bids consisting of combinations of both upward and downward reserves over multiple time-slots, capturing the coupling in the user cost. Furthermore, to address the infamous computational challenges of large-scale combinatorial auctions, we develop a novel fast combinatorial auction (FCA) mechanism that can be solved in polynomial time. It includes an approximate winner determination algorithm and a critical payment scheme. Notably, our proposed mechanism is rigorously proved to possess desirable economic properties such as truthfulness and individual rationality. Extensive simulations have validated the theoretic properties of the proposed CRA mechanism and its advantages over existing methods. In particular, compared with the widely employed truthful Vickery-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism, CRA can be $10^{4}$ times faster than VCG when the user number is above 1000. Meanwhile, it is able to achieve near-optimal social cost, where the average optimality loss is 2.92%.</description></item><item><title>Coordinated Planning for Stability Enhancement in High IBR-Penetrated Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10716464</link><description>Security and stability challenges in future power systems with high penetration Inverter-Based Resources (IBR) have been anticipated as one of the main barriers to decarbonization. Grid-following IBRs may become unstable under small disturbances in weak grids, while during transient processes, system stability and protection may be jeopardized due to the lack of sufficient Short-Circuit Current (SCC). To solve these challenges and achieve decarbonization, the future system has to be carefully planned. However, it remains unclear how both small-signal and transient stabilities can be considered during the system planning stage. In this context, this paper proposes a coordinated planning model of different resources in the transmission system, namely the synchronous condensers and GFM IBRs to enhance system stability. The system strength and SCC constraints are analytically derived by considering the different characteristics of synchronous units and IBRs, which are further effectively linearized through a novel data-driven approach, where an active sampling method is proposed to generate a representative data set. The significant economic value of the proposed coordinated planning framework in both system asset investment and system operation is demonstrated through detailed case studies.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Swing PLL Synchronization Transient Stability of Grid-Connected Paralleled Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10720168</link><description>During grid faults, the grid-connected paralleled converter systems is susceptible to a phase-locked loop (PLL) synchronization transient instability. Most existing studies focus on first-swing transient stability analysis using the equal-area criterion. However, achieving first-swing transient stability does not guarantee overall stability, as the system may still experience multi-swing transient instability. This paper analyzes the type of multi-swing transient instability issue from two aspects: transient instability mechanism and transient stability assessment. Firstly, the mechanism of multi-swing transient instability is revealed from the transient energy conversion point of view. Then, considering transient interactions between converters, the largest estimated domain of attraction (LEDA) is constructed utilizing the Takagi-Sugeno method. Using the LEDA, the multi-swing transient instability problem of the grid-connected paralleled converter systems is quantitatively analyzed. Finally, the theoretical results are verified based on the RT-LAB hardware-in-the-loop experimental platform.</description></item><item><title>Peak Shaving Control for a Virtual Synchronous Generator in Island Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10749988</link><description>A virtual synchronous generator (VSG) can be considered a voltage source with an emulated inertial response. Depending on the grid condition, however, it is necessary to limit the output current, which renders the inverter dynamics and makes the inverter prone to losing synchronism with the grid. To address this well-known challenge, in this article, we propose a novel control method for a VSG that can achieve current limiting with stability. We describe the proposed VSG with block diagrams and validate its control responses with transfer functions. The proposed VSG can be useful to enhance the frequency stability of an island grid, which is more vulnerable to disturbances by nature than a large interconnected system. We use a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) setup for further validation. Using the HIL environment, we test the proposed VSG in an island system operating with diesel generators for generator trips, low-frequency oscillations, and voltage sags. We also test the VSG in a single-inverter-infinite-bus setup to evaluate its transient stability and compare it to ones with conventional current-limiting methods. Although the current limiting shaves the peak power of the VSG, it ensures continuous inertial and damping responses without compromising stability.</description></item><item><title>Performance-Guaranteed Finite-Time Secondary Control for Islanded AC Microgrids With Time-Varying Disturbances</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829834</link><description>This paper investigates distributed finite-time secondary control of islanded AC microgrids with prescribed performance subject to time-varying disturbances. By specifying the desired performance function, the transient and steady-state performances (including the convergence rate, the maximum overshoot, and the maximum steady-state error) of both the voltage and frequency restoration processes are considered in the design phase. Given the microgrid modeling inaccuracies and load-switching effects, the time-varying disturbances lump unmodeled dynamics, parameter perturbations, and exogenous load disturbances. A novel control scheme, which consists of two main parts, is established. In the first part, reference signal generators are constructed to produce the restoration references in a finite time for each power unit. In the second part, with the observer-based disturbance rejection technique and the prescribed performance control philosophy, performance-guaranteed finite-time secondary controllers are designed such that the finite-time restoration task with the prescribed performance is fulfilled, and the time-varying disturbance rejection is achieved. Rigorous stability analysis and case studies are conducted to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Coordination of Smart Hybrid Transformers in Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10770240</link><description>A hybrid transformer is a combination of a conventional transformer and power electronics, which can be used to help alleviate power quality issues in distribution networks at lower costs than solid-state transformers. This paper proposes a novel method of coordinating multiple hybrid transformers in 3-phase distribution networks in order to reduce the curtailment of distributed generators. This is accomplished through the use of sequential linear programming, key features of which include accounting for the nonlinear voltage control capabilities of hybrid transformers, and managing the nonlinear constraints of hybrid transformer power electronics. Test cases were carried out in a modified unbalanced version of the IEEE 69-Bus network and a reduced version of the European Low Voltage test feeder. Test case results demonstrate that hybrid transformers can substantially increase the utilisation of distributed generators.</description></item><item><title>Frequency Constrained Proactive Scheduling for Secure Microgrid Formation in Wind Power Penetrated Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819485</link><description>Microgrid formation (MF) is a core solution for increasing the resilience of distribution systems in extreme situations. However, a significant power imbalance at the MF onset will result in the violation of dynamic frequency constraints, especially in low-inertia wind power penetrated distribution systems (WPP-DSs). To ensure the secure MF after emergencies, this paper proposes a frequency constrained proactive scheduling method for WPP-DSs. The primary frequency response (PFR) model is proposed to describe the microgrid frequency dynamics after islanding, where wind turbines are deloaded to provide a primary reserve. Then the PFR model is incorporated into the scheduling model to ensure frequency security during MF process. The proposed method proactively dispatches controllable units to mitigate the power imbalance and to reserve power for frequency regulation. After emergencies, the primary reserve is released, and adaptive microgrids are securely formed to sustain critical services. The PFR model is formulated as algebraic differential equations (ADEs), which makes it difficult to solve the model directly. Thus, the PFR model is discretized into difference equations and further linearized to facilitate solution. Simulation results validate the merits of the proposed method in reducing the conservatism of proactive scheduling strategies and improving the microgrid security during MF process.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Timescale Security Evaluation and Regulation of Integrated Electricity and Heating System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747833</link><description>The ability to operate across multiple timescales is vital for the flexibility enhancement of integrated electricity and heating systems (IEHS). Nonetheless, the common dependence on numerical solvers operating in discrete spaces poses a challenge in accurately representing their inherent multi-timescale properties, thereby compromising system security. In response, this paper proposes a novel multi-timescale matching method in continuous space to get rid of resolution constraints, circumventing discretization issues while deriving an explicit formulation for thermal dynamics. This forms the groundwork for establishing the global sensitivity factors to quantify the interdependencies within the IEHS. On this basis, a rolling security evaluation and regulation strategy that is cognizant of the asynchronous behaviors in power and heating systems is tailored. Case studies validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method to ensure the IEHS&#8217;s security.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Coordinated Robust Planning of Multi-Energy Ship Microgrids Considering Thermal Inertia and Ship Navigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10834446</link><description>As maritime technology advances, multi-energy ship microgrids (MESMs) are widely used in large cruise tourism. In this context, studying cost-effective and highly reliable energy system planning methods for MESMs in their whole lifespan becomes paramount. Therefore, this paper proposes a joint planning method for a MESM during its lifespan. Firstly, a long timescale coordinated planning and operation scheme is formulated with the aim of maximizing the Net Present Value (NPV) value, thereby reducing both project investment and energy supply cost. In addition, this paper introduces novel operation models that incorporate customer thermal comfort levels, considering thermal inertia, and ship navigation, accounting for the effects of waves and wind. These models enhance the flexibility and practicality of the planning process. Finally, to ensure the safe operation of vessel and alleviate the negative effects of uncertain wind and waves during ship navigation, a robust optimization (RO) approach is employed. A case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, with several comparison analyses further highlighting its advantages.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Robust Planning for Park-Level Integrated Energy System Considering Uncertain Equipment Contingency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10834468</link><description>To enhance the reliability of Integrated Energy Systems (IESs) and address the research gap in reliability-based planning methods, this paper proposes a two-stage robust planning model specifically for park-level IESs. The proposed planning model considers uncertainties like load demand fluctuations and equipment contingencies, and provides a reliable scheme of equipment selection and sizing for IES investors. Inspired by the unit commitment problem, we formulate an equipment contingency uncertainty set to accurately describe the potential equipment contingencies which happen and can be repaired within a day. Then, a modified nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm is applied to solve this two-stage robust planning model with integer recourse efficiently. In the case study, the role of energy storage system for IES reliability enhancement is analyzed in detail. Computational results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model over other planning models in terms of improving reliability.</description></item><item><title>Resilient Preparation and Restoration Strategy for Integrated Electric-Gas Distribution Systems Considering Mobile Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10835752</link><description>Extreme events can interrupt both electricity and gas supply in an integrated electric-gas distribution system (IEGDS). This work proposes a two-stage resilient preparation and restoration strategy to efficiently restore both electric and gas load services in IEGDS after extreme events considering the utilization of mobile energy storage (MES). To minimize the load loss under the damage uncertainty and limited MES resources, a unified MES assigning and dispatching strategy is proposed to optimally coordinate the numbers and locations of pre-event and post-event MES dispatching. To address the MES assigning and pre-event dispatching problems under the damage uncertainty, a two-stage stochastic optimization model is developed, which is efficiently solved by a proposed selective progressive hedging (PH) algorithm. The out-of-sample analysis indicates that the proposed methods can achieve a 53.10% reduction in average load loss compared to scenarios without MES. In addition, the proposed unified MES assigning and dispatching strategy outperforms the preparation-only and restoration-only MES dispatching strategies by reducing 2.65% and 7.13% of average load loss, respectively. Moreover, the proposed selective algorithm can reduce 7.23% to 30.53% of the computational burden compared to the conventional PH algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Time Scale Model Predictive Control-Based Demand Side Management for a Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750304</link><description>The microgrid (MG) integrating clean renewable energy has increasingly emerged as a critical solution for addressing energy challenges and promoting sustainable energy development. However, the inherent uncertainties in renewable energy output and load consumption present significant challenges to the economic and stable operation of the MG. This paper investigates a multi-time model predictive control (MSMPC) strategy for the optimal scheduling of grid-connected MG. The proposed method can dynamically update the optimal scheduling of the MG on two-time scales based on real-time measurement data. The dispatchable thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) are incorporated into the demand side management (DSM) system to enhance flexibility and satisfy the future trend of a larger proportion of controllable TCLs. Furthermore, the TCL model considers the aging problem associated with excessive compressor cycling and the satisfaction of end users. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the economic performance and robustness of the MG system. Moreover, a real-time experiment conducted using RT-LAB further verifies the feasibility of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced Privacy-Preservation in Smart Grid Power Charging Coordination</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10759805</link><description>With the significant growth in the industry of energy storage units (ESUs) and plug-in electric vehicles, charging coordination becomes critical to avoid electric grid overload. However, without effective methods to secure the charging requests, malicious users can eavesdrop on the communication between the ESUs and the grid to extract sensitive users&#8217; information. Therefore, privacy preservation is a must in the design of charging coordination schemes. To address this critical issue, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving charging coordination scheme that allows the aggregator to allocate optimized amounts of charging power to all available ESUs in the community without knowing their individual charging requests details. In particular, based on aggregated secret key communication, best-effort, and cooperative power allocation schemes, the proposed coordination scheme totally hides the sensitive data from all the nodes in the network and performs the power allocation in a semi-blind fashion. Using extensive simulations, we show that our proposed scheme can achieve almost the same performance as that of charging coordination schemes in the literature based on full knowledge of the charging requests while outperforming them by an enhanced level of security. In particular, numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme can allocate 95% of what traditional schemes allocate while keeping ESU information private. Despite the anonymity and collaborative nature of the algorithm, the average convergence time is around 2.7 iterations, with 50% to 100% of cases converging in one iteration.</description></item><item><title>Production Scheduling Identification: An Inverse Optimization Approach for Industrial Load Modeling Using Smart Meter Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769532</link><description>To cost-effectively manage the supply-demand balance of the power system, the flexibility of industrial users could be harnessed through demand-side response. To minimize the negative impact on the production of industrial users during demand-side response, general-purpose models such as the state-task network (STN) are widely used to model the energy-consuming constraints of industrial production processes. However, the required model parameters cannot be set because the required data are privately owned by industrial users and are not directly available, hindering the accurate modeling of industrial loads. In this paper, we propose production scheduling identification (PSI), an inverse-optimization-based approach for industrial load modeling under incomplete information. In PSI, industrial users&#8217; smart meter data are used to identify production scheduling parameters, thus addressing the problem of accurate load modeling when private data are unavailable. We implemented PSI with a modified STN and proposed a practical algorithm to obtain an effective solution. Numerical tests showed that PSI can identify the model parameters of a steel powder plant and a cement plant with acceptable accuracy, using only 21 days of hourly smart meter data. Compared with accurate models established with direct access to private data, the modeling error does not exceed 8.5% and 5.2%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Controlling Air Conditioners for Frequency Regulation: A Real-World Example</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10783092</link><description>Even though thermostatically controlled loads like air conditioners present a great potential for providing ancillary services to the electric power grid, the practical challenges associated with their real-time coordination have not received the necessary attention. In this work, we present a nondisruptive load control application, specifically, we demonstrate how real residential air conditioners can provide frequency regulation. Aggregate power adjustment is achieved by modifying the ON/OFF modes of the air conditioners. To account for both single and multi-zone houses, we extend the currently available techniques and develop an approach that can be used for controlling aggregations that include both types of houses. A discussion of the practical challenges encountered in our field experiments is provided, along with the hardware and software approaches we developed to circumvent them. We argue that limitations of current thermostat APIs introduce significant challenges and are an impediment to widespread adoption of fast load control applications.</description></item><item><title>Carbon-Aware Scheduling of Thermostatically Controlled Loads: A Bilevel DRCC Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10820107</link><description>Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), including air conditioners, heat pumps, water heaters, and refrigerators, play a pivotal role in demand response due to their thermal inertia and inherent flexibility. TCLs also substantially impact energy consumption and emissions within commercial and residential buildings, which makes them critical for the low-/zero-carbon transition that the building sector is undergoing to meet global climate objectives. To aid in this process, this paper proposes a carbon-aware robust scheduling approach for TCLs. The proposed approach precisely models carbon emissions attributed to TCLs, and formulates TCL scheduling as a distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) optimization problem to ensure robust decision-making. We then develop a novel bilevel optimization reformulation strategy to address challenges such as over-conservatism and computational intractability that often arise from solving DRCC problems using conventional approaches. Real-world data evaluation demonstrates significant reductions in costs and carbon emissions compared to state-of-the-art methods, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach in potentially decarbonizing the building sector.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Hydrogen Systems and Demand Response for Enhanced Integration of RES and EVs in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746543</link><description>Global interest in maximizing the hosting capacity (HC) of renewable energy sources (RES) while avoiding high energy curtailment has lately grown in smart grids (SGs). This trend has been associated with the empowerment of hydrogen systems (HS) and demand response (DR). In this regard, this article proposes a new approach to optimally synergize HS and DR for elevated integration of intermittent RES in SGs. The proposed approach is predicated on a coordinated management scheme for various SG control devices, including: a complete HS (hydrogen tank, water electrolyzer, and fuel cell), hydrogen load DR, RES energy curtailment, DSTATCOM functionality of the RES inverters, storage charging rates, and electrical DR. Additionally, the flexibility of electric vehicles (EVs) with G2V/V2G functionalities has been considered to support RES and HS expansion. The proposed approach is formulated as a multi-objective optimization model that aims to optimize two competing objective functions, i.e., total costs and HC capacity of RESs. The simulation results reveal the superiority of the proposed approach which resulted in a notable HC increase of up to 17.24%, accompanied by a significant cost reduction. The proposed approach is also applied to define the optimal number of HS to maximize RES capacity.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Coordinated Automatic Generation Control Involving Distributed Energy Resources: An Aggregation Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746554</link><description>The distributed energy resources (DERs) need to provide ancillary services due to their increasing penetration level in distribution networks (DNs). This paper proposes a hierarchically coordinated automatic generation control (AGC) scheme for the multi-level power grids, to facilitate the DERs to provide AGC service, while ensuring the operational security of the host DNs. Each DN is formulated as an individual AGC participating entity to reduce the computational and communication burden of the transmission system operator (TSO). The distribution system operator (DSO) aggregates its managed DER clusters as a whole, and evaluates the equivalent aggregation dynamic model as well as the regulation capacity. The regulation capacity is evaluated using an optimization program that consider device and network constraints, and prediction uncertainties. The aggregation dynamic model is estimated based on the curve-fitting, which represents the external power response characteristics of the DN as a second-order state-space model. In addition, P-Q affine regulation strategy is employed to coordinate frequency and voltage control. The active and reactive power commands are simultaneously allocated to DER clusters to eliminate voltage violations arising from providing AGC services. Case studies conducted on a multi-level power grid verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Attack-Resilient Distributed Fixed-Time Consensus Control for HBESSs and Circuit Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772734</link><description>This paper investigates the consensus control problem for heterogeneous battery energy storage systems (HBESSs) with switching topologies. An attack-resilient distributed control scheme is proposed to realize active/reactive power sharing, energy level balancing and frequency/voltage restoration within fixed-time. Rigorous proofs derive the convergence time upper bound for each objective, which is independent on the HBESSs&#8217; initial states and tighter than previous bounds. It is also shown that under bounded actuator attacks, above three control objectives can still be realized in fixed-time. Moreover, analog circuits are firstly constructed to physically implement this new control strategy, which provides a new insight to deploy advanced control schemes on HBESSs. Several simulation examples validate those conclusions from both numerical and circuital perspectives.</description></item><item><title>Near-Optimal Energy Management Strategy for a Grid-Forming PV and Hybrid Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771975</link><description>Integration of Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) into PV plants enables a hybrid PV system with more grid functions like power filtering and frequency regulation. Above that, an energy management system (EMS) plays a key role in achieving grid functions and economic performance. However, previous efforts focused on advanced forecast methods without considering real-time EMS. This paper thus aims to develop a practical real-time EMS with near-optimal performance for the degradation of the hybrid energy storage system (HESS). Firstly, a variational mode decomposition (VMD) method is combined with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to decompose and learn feature parameters of typical historical weather data, improving forecast accuracy and shifting the operation mode periodically. Then, the mixed integer linear programming approach is utilized to find out the optimal control mode in different operation scenarios, and three-segment rules are extracted from the optimization results. Finally, the deep learning-based real-time EMS is developed. Numeric simulations validate that the proposed EMS can achieve near-optimal performance with a low computation burden. Besides, the proposed strategy can reduce the degradation cost by up to 80% compared with competitive rule-based strategies.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Area Architecture for Real-Time Feedback-Based Optimization of Distribution Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819497</link><description>A challenge in transmission-distribution coordination is how to quickly and reliably coordinate Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) across large multi-stakeholder Distribution Networks (DNs) to support the Transmission Network (TN), while ensuring operational constraints continue to be met within the DN. Here we propose a hierarchical feedback-based control architecture for coordination of DERs in DNs, enabling the DN to quickly respond to power set-point requests from the Transmission System Operator (TSO) while maintaining local DN constraints. Our scheme allows for multiple independently-managed areas within the DN to optimize their local resources while coordinating to support the TN, and while maintaining data privacy; the only required inter-area communication is between physically adjacent areas within the DN control hierarchy. We conduct a rigorous stability analysis, establishing intuitive conditions for closed-loop stability, and provide detailed tuning recommendations. The proposal is validated via case studies on multiple feeders, including IEEE-123 and IEEE-8500, using a custom MATLAB&#174;-based application which integrates with OpenDSS&#169;. The simulation results show that the proposed structure is highly scalable and can quickly coordinate DERs in response to TSO commands, while responding to local disturbances within the DN and maintaining DN operational limits.</description></item><item><title>Lyapunov Method-Based Coherent Aggregation of Grid-Forming Converters for Transient Stability Equivalents</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819501</link><description>Paralleled grid-forming converters (GFMs) system suffers from transient instability issues while accurate model is complicated and unsuitable to give stability analysis. Existing aggregation method requires either extensive computation or linearized model assumption to realize coherent identification, which might not distinguish unstable units from stable clusters. In this paper, a two-step algorithm is proposed to realize coherent recognition for multi-GFMs system based on Lyapunov energy function: 1) unstable GFMs are distinguished from stable clusters based on Lyapunov&#8217;s function, 2) stable GFMs are further divided into different clusters using stored potential energy as a criterion. First, large-signal model considering transient interactions and virtual impedance-based fault ride through (VI-FRT) control is derived in transient stability time-scale. Then, Lyapunov energy function (LEF) is constructed for multi-GFMs system taking virtual damping coefficients and voltage dynamics into account. Compared with existing methods, the constructed LEF presents higher stability prediction accuracy and lower computational burden. Moreover, it is found that the relative potential energy among different GFMs can be adopted to identify coherent clusters, which is proved to be mathematically equivalent to coherency recognition using power angle deviation as the indicator. Finally, parameters aggregation is realized using the concept of center of inertia (COI). Based on the proposed method, equivalent reduced model has good accuracy in transient stability prediction compared with full-order model. Both numerical simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments are provided to validate the feasibility of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Equitable Active-Reactive Power Envelopes for Distributed Energy Resources in Power Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829662</link><description>The operating envelope (OE) provides an effective method to manage distributed energy resources (DERs) in power distribution systems (DSs) by offering allowable regions of nodal power injections. The active-reactive power envelope (P-Q envelope) is a desirable type of OE that would increase the allowable active power range and release the reactive power flexibility. However, existing OE studies have not established P-Q envelopes with guaranteed equitableness. This paper proposes an equitable P-Q envelope calculation and optimization method. First, we model the P-Q envelopes as convex polygons on active-reactive power planes of nodal power injections. Second, we define the proportional equitableness of P-Q envelopes and establish two equitable conditions, under which the equitableness of P-Q envelopes is proved mathematically. Third, we propose the P-Q envelope calculation method. Specifically, the P-Q envelopes are initially established considering the security constraints of DSs and then modified by a geometric method to satisfy two equitable conditions. Finally, we develop the optimization method to increase the maximum active power export and import provided by P-Q envelopes by coordinating the on-load tap changer, capacitor banks, and distributed generators. The proposed methods are tested on the 33-bus, real-world 135-bus and 455-bus DSs. Numerical results show that the proposed method efficiently obtains the P-Q envelopes with strict proportional equitableness and remarkably enlarges the size of P-Q envelopes by optimizing the control strategies of DS devices. Compared with existing OE calculation methods, the proposed method obtains the largest allowable power range using the shortest computation time.</description></item><item><title>Coordination of Multi-Agent Orderly Charging via an Incentive-Compatible Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750297</link><description>As the cyber-physical system is developed into cyber-physical-social system, the importance of social factors is growing in the interaction between electric vehicle (EV) and power system. This paper aims to develop an incentive-compatible mechanism to coordinate multi-agent orderly charging. Firstly, the travel behaviors of EV cluster are simulated based on Monte Carlo sampling, and the load transfer model considering various social factors is constructed. Then, an orderly charging mechanism involving multiple agents based on Nash bargaining theory is proposed. In the first stage, the total profit of electric vehicle user, power grid company (PGC), and charge station operator is maximized. In the second stage, the revenue of each agent after participating in the cooperation is improved by transfer payment. Next, the carbon trading mechanism is applied in the incentive compatibility model, and the revenue of PGC participating in the carbon market under different scenarios and constraints are calculated. Finally, by comparing with the existing model, the simulation results show that the proposed multi-agent coordinated orderly charging model can reduce the pressure on the power grid caused by the randomness of EV travel, and through a fair profit distribution mechanism, it can maximize the social benefits of the coalition while increasing the revenue of each agent.</description></item><item><title>Joint Energy-Computation Management for Electric Vehicles Under Coordination of Power Distribution Networks and Computing Power Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753461</link><description>This paper explores the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into the power distribution network (PDN) and computing power network (CPN), leveraging EVs&#8217; inherent energy storage and computing resources. A conceptual hub called a charging and computing station (CCS) is introduced, enabling parked EVs to interact with the PDN and CPN simultaneously. The CPN is composed of the EVs and edge servers, whose computing resources are collectively utilized for processing computation tasks from various applications. The EVs and edge servers in CCSs consume energy at different nodes of the PDN. A two-stage framework is proposed for joint energy and computation management in the EV-PDN-CPN coordination. In Stage 1, a day-ahead system cost minimization problem is formulated with decisions on EV charging/discharging energy scheduling and computation task reallocation among edge servers. A fast algorithm based on the convex-concave procedure is developed to solve the Stage-1 problem whose nonconvexity stems from network constraints of both the PDN and CPN. In Stage 2, EV computing resources are utilized to achieve real-time task offloading, coping with the prediction errors of computation tasks in Stage 1 and minimizing the use of extra energy and computing resources. A linear search algorithm is proposed to solve the nonconvex Stage-2 problem. Results show that the proposed algorithms are more computationally efficient than off-the-shelf solvers, and the proposed EV-PDN-CPN coordination model can save 4.7% and 91.9% of costs in the two stages, respectively, compared to uncoordinated models.</description></item><item><title>Consensus Algorithm-Based Two-Stage Frequency Regulation Strategy With EVs Participating as VSMs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771824</link><description>Isolated grids, with large-scale intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs), face more severe frequency stability issues. Fortunately, grid-connected electric vehicles (EVs) present an opportunity to provide frequency services. In this paper, a two-stage frequency regulation strategy, in which EVs participate in the form of a virtual synchronous machine (VSM), is proposed. First, a frequency response (FR) model is established for both charging stations (CSs) and battery swapping stations (BSSs) using VSM control. On this basis, a two-stage strategy is proposed to consider both frequency regulation performance and system economy. Specifically, in the day-ahead stage (DAS), a multi-unit economic dispatch (ED) model is designed to formulate the operation plan; in the real-time stage (RTS), a consensus-based power allocation strategy is designed for multi-units, responsive to real-time market prices. Case studies involving real-world data of load, RES, and CS illustrate the key benefits of the proposed method, including (i) decreasing frequency deviation, (ii) providing extra rotational inertia, and (iii) reducing dispatch costs.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Aware Scheduling and Control of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations for Dispatching Active Distribution Networks: Theory and Experimental Validation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829625</link><description>This paper proposes and experimentally validates a grid-aware scheduling and control framework for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) for dispatching the operation of active distribution networks (ADNs). The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage (day-ahead), we determine an optimal 24-hour power schedule at the grid connection point (GCP), referred to as the dispatch plan. Then, in the second stage, a real-time model predictive control (RT-MPC) is proposed to track the day-ahead dispatch plan using flexibility from EVCSs and other controllable resources (e.g., batteries). The dispatch plan accounts for the uncertainties of vehicles connected to the EVCS along with other uncontrollable power injections, by day-ahead predicted scenarios. The RT-MPC accounts for the uncertainty of the power injections of stochastic resources (such as demand and generation from photovoltaic &#8211; PV plants) by short-term forecasts. The framework ensures that the grid is operated within its nodal voltage and branches power-flow operational bounds, modeled by a linearized optimal power-flow model, maintaining the tractability of the problem formulation. The scheme is numerically and experimentally validated on a real-life ADN at the EPFL hosting two controllable EVCSs (172 kWp and 32 kWp), multiple PV plants (aggregated generation of 42 kWp), uncontrollable demand from office buildings (20 kWp), and two controllable BESSs (150kW/300kWh and 25kW/25kWh).</description></item><item><title>Peer-to-Peer Multi-Energy Trading Among Heterogeneous Building Prosumers via Asynchronous Distributed Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10877846</link><description>Smart buildings in the integrated community energy system (ICES) are normally equipped with distributed energy resources (DERs), thereby creating building prosumers with both energy production and consumption. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading among building prosumers can bring higher economic benefits for them. Therefore, a P2P multi-energy trading scheme among building prosumers is proposed, which fully explores the flexibility of buildings&#8217; heating loads based on the thermal dynamics of buildings with different thermal insulation properties. Each building prosumer is heterogeneous in terms of its computation and communication infrastructures. This results in a heavy computation burden with the traditional centralized method. To improve the computational efficiency for P2P trading among heterogeneous building prosumers, an asynchronous distributed algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to enable each prosumer to trade energy asynchronously instead of waiting for the trading information from others with poor infrastructure. This asynchronous procedure integrated with the prediction and anomaly detection steps can further accelerate the convergence speed of P2P trading. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed trading scheme and the feasibility and solution optimality of the proposed algorithm.</description></item><item><title>A Joint Power and Renewable Energy Certificate Trading Method in the Peer-to-Peer Market</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777014</link><description>A novel peer-to-peer joint power &amp; renewable energy certificate trading method is proposed to reflect the power &amp; environment values of renewable power simultaneously, as well as promote the on-site utilization.

Various control methods have been previously proposed to manage and control LCC-HVDC systems, but none have provided a multi-level control system capable of operating in multiple areas simultaneously. This article presents a comprehensive and multi-task control system for wide-area HVDC systems. In the proposed control systems, multi-level frequency control is conducted in multi-area LCC-HVDC interconnected grids. Additionally, various control strategies are implemented to enhance the network&#8217;s resilience during three-phase fault conditions. Furthermore, the proposed control system can detect and distinguish intelligent false data injection (FDI) cyber-attacks. Nonlinear time domain simulations conducted in MATLAB/SIMULINK demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively balance the frequency of weaker areas, enhance network resilience in critical conditions, and identify FDI cyber-attacks.</description></item><item><title>Detection-Triggered Recursive Impact Mitigation Against Secondary False Data Injection Attacks in Cyber-Physical Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746504</link><description>The cybersecurity of microgrid has received widespread attentions due to the frequently reported attack accidents against distributed energy resource (DER) manufactures. Numerous impact mitigation schemes have been proposed to reduce or eliminate the impacts of false data injection attacks (FDIAs). Nevertheless, the existing methods either requires at least one neighboring trustworthy agent or may bring in unacceptable cost burdens. This paper aims to propose a detection-triggered recursive impact mitigation scheme that can timely and precisely counter the secondary FDIAs (SFDIAs) against the communication links among DERs. Once triggering attack alarms, the power line current readings will be utilised to observe the voltage bias injections through the physical interconnections among DERs, based on which the current bias injections can be recursively reconstructed from the residuals generated by unknown input observers (UIOs). The attack impacts are eliminated by subtracting the reconstructed bias from the incoming compromised data. The proposed mitigation method can work even in the worst case where all communication links are under SFDIAs and only require extra current sensors. The bias reconstruction performance under initial errors and system noises is theoretically analysed and the reconstruction error is proved to be bounded regardless of the electrical parameters. To avoid deploying current sensors on all power lines, a cost-effective deployment strategy is presented to secure a spanning tree set of communication links that can guarantee the secondary control performance. Extensive validation studies are conducted in MATLAB/Simulink and cyber-physical microgrid testbeds to validate the proposed method&#8217;s effectiveness against single/multiple and continuous/discrete SFDIAs.</description></item><item><title>Consecutive Load Redistribution Attack Without Line Admittance Information</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10756615</link><description>This paper develops a novel method for launching a stealthy Load Redistribution Attack (LRA) without requiring knowledge of the power network&#8217;s admittance matrix. Initially, equations involving the admittance matrix in the conventional LRA model are substituted with equivalent conditions utilizing the Power Transfer Distribution Factor (PTDF) matrix. Subsequently, a ridge regression approach is applied to estimate the PTDF matrix based on the hijacked Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data. To maximize the damage inflicted by the proposed LRA, a consecutively small-scale attack strategy is designed to gather more informative data, and the PTDF matrix estimation is then updated accordingly to enhance its accuracy. Ultimately, a stealthy LRA is completed using the final PTDF matrix estimation. The rationale behind employing the PTDF matrix estimation in the proposed method, as opposed to the estimation of the admittance matrix, is that the latter requires information on bus voltage phase angles not supplied by the SCADA system. Simulations on the IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus system, without admittance information for grid transmission lines, demonstrate the accuracy and efficacy of the proposed attack.</description></item><item><title>Infinitesimal-Attack-High-Impact Phenomena: Cyber-Attack Bifurcation in Two-Terminal HVDC Power Delivery Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772379</link><description>Voltage-source converters (VSC) and current-source converters (CSC) are two predominant techniques in high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) power delivery systems. They are crucial for inter-regional power exchange. The cyber vulnerabilities of HVDC systems have been physically demonstrated, threatening their secure operation. To this end, this study investigates the closed-form bifurcation hyperplanes in the cyber-attack injection space of both the VSC HVDC system and the CSC HVDC system. By considering the inherent nonlinearity in intra-station switching control and inter-station coordination control, this study formulates different clusters of attack-induced equilibrium points in HVDC systems. Closed-form sufficient conditions are then derived for triggering small-attack-high-impact and even infinitesimal-attack-high-impact phenomena, in which an infinitesimal cyber-attack can activate rapid power reversal by altering the DC current polarity in VSC HVDC systems or DC voltage polarity in CSC HVDC systems. These attack-induced properties are experimentally validated by establishing a hardware-in-the-loop HVDC cybersecurity testbed, incorporating a Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) and a STM32F429-based cyber-attack prototype. The video demonstration and the first-of-its-kind open-source HVDC cybersecurity testbed are attached.</description></item><item><title>LPPMM-DA: Lightweight Privacy-Preserving Multi-Dimensional and Multi-Subset Data Aggregation for Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10776781</link><description>The smart grid facilitates data centers in collecting real-time power consumption data from users, which is essential for effective power management. Such real-time data may inadvertently disclose the identities and activities of power users. Data aggregation has been identified as a viable solution to this challenge, enabling data centers to obtain only the aggregate power consumption data without accessing individual user information. However, most existing aggregation methodologies are limited to multi-dimensional data aggregation and fail to ensure user privacy, data integrity, and authentication. In this study, we propose a ring signature based multi-dimensional and multi-subset aggregation (LPPMM-DA) scheme. This proposed method allows the data center to compute both the total power consumption and the number of users within each subset across various dimensions. Based on the hardness assumption of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), the ring signature utilized in our scheme is demonstrably unforgeable against adaptive chosen message attacks within the random oracle model. A comprehensive analysis indicates that the proposed scheme meets the security requirements for data aggregation in the smart grid context. Furthermore, performance evaluations reveal that the implementation of this scheme results in lower computational and communication overhead compared to existing related approaches.</description></item><item><title>Securing FACTS-Based Wide Area Damping Controllers Using Modified Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772252</link><description>The performance of wide-area damping controllers (WADCs) heavily depends on the accuracy and authenticity of the measurements received from phasor measurement units (PMUs). These controllers receive PMU data and send the control commands back to grid actuators, e.g., flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices. The use of cyber systems required for transferring PMU measurements, however, makes the controller and entire power system prone to a variety of cyber attacks, e.g., false data injection attacks (FDIAs). On this basis, this paper (i) proposes an FDIA model against FACTS-based WADCs and (ii) develops detection and mitigation methods for the proposed attacks. First, FDIAs are designed to destabilize the system, considering realistic limitations on the power grids. Then, a modified conditional generative adversarial network (MCGAN) is utilized for the detection and mitigation of these FDIAs. To detect this attack, a detector is developed from the discriminator of MCGAN, using the fine-tuning technique. The use of this proposed method enhances detection performance in imbalanced datasets and effectively identifies unseen high-risk attacks. Following the detection, a mitigation method is implemented based on the coordination of a graph-based interpolation and the tuned generator of the developed MCGAN. This method effectively mitigates the impact of the FDIAs on the FACTS-based WADCs. The effectiveness of the attack model, as well as the detection and mitigation methods, is assessed using the two-area Kundur and New England 39-Bus test systems.</description></item><item><title>Power Distribution Network Topology Detection Using Dual-Graph Structure Graph Neural Network Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10779459</link><description>Topology detection (TD) in the context of power distribution networks (PDNs) is a fundamental requirement for a wide range of applications, such as fault localization and load management. PDNs suffer from a lack of real-time topological information due to insufficient data on switch statuses and an increasing number of switching actions caused by reconfigurations and the control of distributed energy resources (DERs). On this basis, in this paper, a novel near real-time TD method for PDNs is proposed. This method is built on a specialized graph neural network (GNN) design using data from micro-phasor measurement units ( $\mu $ PMUs), leveraging the strengths of both graph-based learning and conventional deep learning (DL) approaches. More specifically, the developed TD method implements a novel dual-graph structure GNN (DGS-GNN) model to transform the TD problem into an inductive link prediction task for a multi-graph dataset. During the training phase, a node attribute similarity graph is created, and the resulting node embeddings are aligned with the actual topology graph (ATG) using a structure-aware loss function. In the inference phase, however, unlike standard GNN models that require structural information as input, the ATG is recovered based solely on node attributes. The developed method enables TD using a limited number of phasor measurements with low inference time and superior generalization capability for unseen scenarios. Its strong performance in large-scale PDNs with varying configurations, as well as its robustness to uncertainties from DERs and noisy environments, is demonstrated on the IEEE 33- and 123-Bus benchmarks and a standard 240-Bus test system. The proposed method outperforms its DL-based counterparts in scenarios where full or partial system topology should be detected.</description></item><item><title>Detection of FDIA in Power Grid Based on Hypergraph and Attention Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819489</link><description>False data injection attack (FDIA) is posing a threat to the security of power grids. Detection technology is an effective means to defend against FDIA, but the existing mainstream methods have insufficient detection capabilities for large-scale power grids. This study proposes a novel method that combines subgraph partitioning strategy and hypergraph model to detect FDIA. According to the principle the attack principle, the power grid is partitioned into subgraphs. Each subgraph is constructed as the hypergraph and then input into the hypergraph convolutional neural network (HGCNN). The hypergraph attention mechanism (HGAT) is adopted to pay attention to the hyperedge, where the attention score is calculated through the similarity between the node and the hyperedge. Simulations were conducted on IEEE 14-, 118-, and 300-bus systems. At the 10% attack intensity, the proposed method achieved 1.62%, 2.05%, and 2.18% higher accuracy than the optimal results of the comparison methods on three test systems, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Fostering Trust in Smart Inverters: A Framework for Firmware Update Management and Tracking in VPP Context</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829643</link><description>Ensuring the reliability and security of smart inverters that provide the interface between distributed energy resources (DERs) and the power grid becomes paramount with the surge in integrating DERs into the (smart) power grid. Despite the importance of having updated firmware/software versions within a reasonable time frame, existing methods for establishing trust through firmware updates lack effective historical tracking and verification. This paper introduces a novel framework to manage and track firmware update history, leveraging verifiable credentials. By tracking the update history and implementing a trust cycle based on these verifiable updates, we aim to improve grid resilience, enhance cybersecurity, and increase transparency for stakeholders.</description></item><item><title>Toward Value-Oriented Renewable Energy Forecasting: An Iterative Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771620</link><description>Energy forecasting is an essential task in power system operations. Operators usually issue forecasts and use them to schedule energy dispatch in advance. However, forecasting models are typically developed in a way that overlooks the decision value of forecasts. To bridge the gap, we design a value-oriented point forecasting approach for sequential energy dispatch problems with renewable energy sources. At the training phase, we align the training objective with the decision value, i.e., minimizing the overall operating cost. The forecasting model parameter estimation is formulated as a bilevel program. Under mild assumptions, we convert the upper-level objective into an equivalent form using the dual solutions obtained from the lower-level operation problems. In addition, a novel iterative solution strategy is proposed for the newly formulated bilevel program. Under such an iterative scheme, we show that the upper-level objective is locally linear with respect to the forecasting model output and can act as the loss function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared to commonly used forecasts predicting expected realization, forecasts obtained by the proposed approach result in lower operating costs. Meanwhile, the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to that of two-stage stochastic programs, but is more computationally efficient.</description></item><item><title>On the Solution Uniqueness of Data-Driven Modeling of Flexible Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10803001</link><description>This letter first explores the solution uniqueness of the data-driven modeling of price-responsive flexible loads (PFL).

To address this, we analyze the structural and practical identifiability of the PFL model, deriving the dataset condition that guarantees the solution uniqueness. Besides, we point out the practical implications of the results. Numerical tests validate this work.</description></item><item><title>Energy Management System Based on S-Shaped Functions for Series Hybrid Vehicle Under a Fully Active Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753086</link><description>This paper proposes an energy management system (EMS) applied to a series hybrid vehicle (SHV) powered by an internal combustion engine (ICE) and a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) consisting of chemical batteries and supercapacitors. The EMS enables power sharing among the ICE and the HESS under a fully active topology to improve control flexibility, considering that the ICE-generator set and HESS efficiencies are limited to a specific power injection operating range and transient responses. In this context, power sharing is performed using S-shaped functions that focus on maximizing supercapacitor usability to reduce fuel consumption and battery current stress. The advantage of the S-shaped function lies on its easy configuration and reduced number of control parameters. Additionally, meta-heuristic optimization is used to tune the S-shaped functions according to the sources requirements for optimal performance in standard driving cycles, while Lyapunov&#8217;s indirect method performs the stability analysis of the control strategy. Finally, experimental and computational simulations are accomplished to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed EMS compared with traditional methods and an optimal approach.</description></item><item><title>Predictive Beamforming in Integrated Sensing and Communication-Enabled Vehicular Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753082</link><description>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has recently attracted significant research attention. This paper develops the deep learning-based predictive beamforming method for the ISAC-enabled vehicular networks. Traditional deep learning (DL) is a data-driven approach, which means that numerous training samples are required to improve system performance. In addition, embedded devices are not able to provide sufficient computing power, which hinders the application of DL solutions. Motivated by this, the dynamic self-attention mechanism is proposed to reduce the dependence of DL on training samples. Aiming for the optimal trade-off between sensing performance and computational complexity, the efficient model design, Self-Attention Channel Shuffle Mobile Network (SACSMN), is formulated. Experimental results demonstrate that SACSMN achieves similar sensing performance to that based on the full training set under the condition of few samples, the dependence of SACSMN on training samples is significantly reduced. Furthermore, SACSMN significantly reduces the computational complexity while achieving the same level of sensing performance as the benchmarks, realizing the optimal trade-off between system sensing performance and computational complexity. Benefiting from the robust sensing performance of SACSMN, the system achieves the same level of communication performance as that based on full training samples in the case of few samples.</description></item><item><title>OFDM-Based Waveform Design for MIMO DFRC Systems With Reduced Range Sidelobes: A Majorization-Minimization Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753570</link><description>This paper focuses on waveform design for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems, particularly tailored for environments with multiple single-antenna downlink user equipments (UEs). Our approach leverages orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology to address the challenges of frequency-selective fading. To mitigate the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) issues inherent in OFDM signals, the desired low-PAPR property is also incorporated into the design of the waveforms. For enhanced radar sensing functionality, we introduce an advanced metric, the weighted peak or integrated sidelobe level (WPISL), meticulously crafted to measure and minimize low-range sidelobes. On the communication front, we integrate constructive interference (CI) techniques to significantly enhance quality of service (QoS) in data transmission. To address the intricate optimization challenges presented by our design objectives, we have developed an efficient algorithm anchored in the majorization-minimization (MM) framework. The numerical experiments demonstrate that this algorithm notably surpasses existing state-of-the-art benchmarks in reducing range sidelobe interference. Furthermore, our CI-based approach yields enhanced performance compared to traditional least squares (LS) methods, achieving lower symbol error rates (SER) and higher average achievable sum rates.</description></item><item><title>On the Capacity Region of Optical Mobile Communication Systems With Spatial Light Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753637</link><description>Optical Mobile Communication (OMC) is a newly raised optical wireless communication system, where a novel device called Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) is applied. With the deploying of SLM units, OMC systems can split one light beam to multiple beams directing to different receivers, and hence bring in a new design freedom on the energy allocation for each sub-beam. In this paper, we study a general model of the OMC systems that the transmitter wants to broadcast multiple messages to multiple users, and some of the users may request a same message. We focus on characterizing the capacity region of such OMC systems, in order to assess the benefits on capacity by deploying SLM units. For the general cases, numerical solutions of the capacity region are raised, and for special cases that the system is symmetric or the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is rather low, closed form results of the capacity region are proposed. We also study the OMC system which broadcasts two different messages, and give out a partial closed form result of the capacity region. From this case, we can find that characterizing the capacity region for OMC systems is equivalent to optimizing high order polynomial, which is doable but impossible to find closed form results in general. Key words: Optical Mobile Communication, Spatial Light Modulator, capacity region.</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning Based Energy-Efficient Hybird RSMA for UAV-Assisted mmWave Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10759308</link><description>This paper investigates hybrid rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication network (RSMA-UAV-MMWCN), where a UAV transmits messages to multiple ground user equipment under the influence of an external jammer. We formulate a non-convex joint optimization problem involving hybrid RSMA matrices and a common rate allocation vector, with the objective of maximizing energy efficiency while approaching the performance of ideal hybrid RSMA. Departing from traditional non-convex problem-solving methods, we introduce a hybrid RSMA optimization scheme based on deep residual networks to enhance the feasibility of hybrid precoding and decoding. Initially, due to the absence of standardized and universal datasets, we propose a dataset generation algorithm to create training and testing datasets for subsequent communication model training. Subsequently, we construct a loss function that integrates the objective function with the constraints of the optimization problem. Lastly, to ensure that the optimization variables strictly comply with the constraints, we design a mandatory constraint module comprising modulus, power, and rate constraint sub-modules. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm surpasses traditional optimization methods, and RSMA shows significant advantages over conventional multiple access (MA) schemes.</description></item><item><title>Latency Minimization for MEC-V2X Assisted Autonomous Vehicles Task Offloading</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752420</link><description>Delay-sensitive applications for autonomous vehicles (AVs) require a substantial amount of computational resources. However, the onboard computation resources may be insufficient, resulting in long processing latencies. To deal with this critical issue, we jointly consider roadside unit (RSU) and assistant vehicle offloading, along with resource allocation, to minimize latency for vehicular tasks. This approach also takes into account frequency reuse among sub-areas for assistant vehicle offloading. The latency minimization problem can be formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. Given the inherent complexity of the MINLP problem, we propose a two-step solution. The first step focuses on the combined decision of assistant vehicle offloading and transmit power allocation. To solve this problem, we propose a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with low complexity and low average transmit power. The second step deals with RSU offloading/local computation decision, bandwidth allocation, and computation resource allocation. An iterative algorithm is proposed to achieve the optimal solution. Without adding additional computation resources, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed vehicular task offloading approach improves overall delay performance than the adaptive MEC offloading scheme and the pure MEC computing scheme.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Prioritization and Task Offloading in Vehicular Edge Computing Through Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10755183</link><description>Vehicular edge computing enables real-time decision-making by offloading vehicular computation tasks to edge servers along roadways. This paper focuses on optimizing offloading and scheduling these tasks, with an emphasis on task prioritization to maximize task completion within deadlines while minimizing latency and energy consumption across all priority levels. We propose a prioritized Deep Q-Network (DQNP) that optimizes long-term rewards through a priority-scaled reward system for each priority level, guiding the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent to select optimal actions. The model dynamically adjusts task selection based on environmental conditions, such as prioritizing tasks with higher deadlines in poor channel states, ensuring balanced and efficient offloading across all priority levels. Simulation results demonstrate that DQNP outperforms existing baseline algorithms, increasing task completion by 14%, particularly for high-priority tasks, while reducing energy consumption by 8% and maintaining similar latency. Additionally, the model mitigates resource starvation for lower-priority tasks, achieving task selection rates of 27%, 32%, and 42% for low-, medium-, and high-priority tasks, with completion ratios of 88%, 87%, and 86%, respectively, reflecting balanced resource allocation across priority classes.</description></item><item><title>Covert Beamforming Design for Cooperative NOMA-Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752409</link><description>In this paper, we consider covert communication in a cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where the ISAC relay can communicate with the covert user under the cover of probing waveforms and public communication waveforms without detection by the warden. For the proposed scheme, a closed-form expression for the minimum average detection error probability of warden is derived, where the detection threshold can be dynamically adjusted by the warden. Besides, we jointly design the covert transmission beamforming, target beamforming, and public transmission beamforming for maximizing the covert rate, subject to satisfying the successive interference cancellation decoding order, the quality of service requirement constraint at the public user, the sensing constraint, the covert constraint, and the total transimt power constraint. The sub-optimal solutions can be derived by employing semidefinite relaxation and the Charnes-Cooper transformation, which are provided to solve the proposed non-convex covert rate maximization problem. Simulation results demostrate that the covert rate of the proposed scheme can be effectively enhanced, compared to the ISAC systems assisted by orthogonal multiple access.</description></item><item><title>Design of STAR-RIS Assisted Uplink NOMA for Maximum Fairness</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753571</link><description>To support massive connectivity with full service coverage, this paper integrates a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) into uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). In particular, the energy splitting (ES) protocol of STAR-RIS is considered, leading to two types of NOMA: ES/NOMA, which simultaneously supports all users in the transmitting and reflecting spaces of the STAR-RIS and ES/hybrid NOMA (H-NOMA), which supports multiple ES/NOMA pairs in time division multiple access (TDMA). To maximize rate fairness, we develop STAR-RIS beamforming and resource allocation algorithms for ES/NOMA and ES/H-NOMA, along with a globally optimal solution and a closed-form solution for two-user ES/NOMA. The proposed ES/NOMA algorithm achieves faster computation than conventional alternating optimization. The proposed ES/H-NOMA algorithm significantly reduces the complexity of ES/NOMA by using a closed-form solution for two-user ES/NOMA and designing a faster user assignment algorithm with optimal time allocation.

In this work, we explore the performance of a SIM-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system that incorporates joint beamforming and power allocation. Specifically, we jointly design the transmit power allocation at access points (APs) and the wave-based beamforming at SIMs for maximizing the system sum rate. An alternating optimization (AO)-based iterative algorithm is proposed for solving the complex non-convex problem, which is decomposed into two subproblems. For the transmit power allocation subproblem, maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is employed to maximize signal receiving power. For the optimization subproblem of SIM phase shifts, a proficient gradient ascent algorithm is deployed to ensure convergence to a local optimum. Simulation results show an enhancement in the performance of the proposed AO algorithm compared to baseline methods.

We then analyze that the user set can be determined by solely considering the effective signal power, which is achieved by the convergence of the sum of interference as the numbers of users and antennas go to infinity. Based on the analysis, we propose a user selection algorithm that utilizes the effective signal power. To this end, we introduce feedback of the effective channel quality representing the effective signal power, which is then employed in choosing users.

Despite targets to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, fossil fuels still dominate the energy industry systems in the USA and Canada. Transition pathways are developed and analyzed comparing a complete defossilization of both energy and nonenergy demands with business-as-usual conditions based on government projections. The results demonstrate the benefits of transitioning to 100% renewable energy for all sectors, as excess low-cost electricity from solar PV can be used for power-to-X solutions to produce electricity-based fuels, chemicals, and materials. By 2050, the power sector will only consume 20% of generated electricity, with the remaining used to electrify the heat, transport, and industry sectors. Thus, 86% of all primary energy in the system comes from renewable electricity, as total electricity generation increases from 4394 TWh in 2020 to 20 795 TWh in 2050. Solar PV reaches 78% of all electricity generation, leading to 10.6 TW of installed capacity. The full energy industry sector transition leads to reductions in both levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and levelized cost of final energy (LCOFE). The LCOE sees massive reductions from 72 &#8364;/MWh in 2020 to 25 &#8364;/MWh in 2050, and the LCOFE decreases from the current 50 to 41 &#8364;/MWh in 2050. The strong operational synergies between solar PV and flexible electrolysis enable a transition pathway that demonstrates the viability of a Power-to-X Economy in achieving climate targets of net-zero emissions.

The Se alloying enables a short-circuit current density improvement, as it leads to a bandgap energy value decrease. Furthermore, it has been associated with increased minority carrier lifetimes, assuring high open-circuit voltage values. An Se gradient profile control can further optimize the solar cell performance. Thus, an optical model baseline of the CdSexTe1&#8722;x (CST) compound was developed. Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements were conducted to accurately extract the optical constants of ten CST layers deposited through coevaporation with x varying from 0 to 1. Using the measured dielectric function spectra from the discrete CST layers with varying x, and considering the composition-induced shift in the critical point energies, an energy-shift model was employed to develop the accurate optical library for the CST compound for any x value to provide data for future modeling and optimization. The library accuracy was validated through optical simulations of the quantum efficiency of a graded CST solar cell using the finite-difference time-domain method by replicating the Se profile in the absorber layer measured through secondary ion mass spectrometry.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Encapsulation Processing Conditions on Degradation Mechanisms of Carbon-Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10876559</link><description>Perovskite photovoltaic (PV) cells have achieved a record 26.7% efficiency, but improvements in stability against humidity, temperature shifts, and light exposure remain crucial. In this work, we explored mesoporous carbon-based perovskite (c-PSC) devices because of carbon's stability and the elimination of a heat-sensitive hole transport layer. Encapsulation materials exhibiting promising properties with silicon PV, including a thermoplastic polyolefin encapsulant, were applied under different lamination conditions to investigate the impact on c-PSC devices&#8217; durability, which is a novel study for this specific combination of materials. Inadequate curing can compromise adhesion, reduce moisture resistance, and accelerate perovskite decomposition under light exposure. Increasing the lamination temperature by 20&#8201;&#176;C allowed samples to withstand 1000 h of damp-heat conditions, with a 30% reduction in efficiency, while lower temperature lamination caused immediate performance drops. While light exposure remained highly degrading, higher lamination temperatures delayed damage, preserving 2.5% of the initial power conversion efficiency after 400 h of aging and slowing perovskite decomposition.</description></item><item><title>A Spot-Area Method to Evaluate the Incidence Angle Modifier of Photovoltaic Devices-Part 2: Modules (Differential Method)</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10835743</link><description>In Part 1 of our article, we presented a method to quantify the incidence angle modifier (IAM) of photovoltaic (PV) devices, which differs from the methods proposed in IEC 61853-2 through the following: it utilizes a spot-area irradiation, delivered by an optical fiber system, a customized angle probe holder, and a current-to-voltage converter. Part 1 focused on single-cell devices and presented the validation of the new method on two different cell architectures. In Part 2, we generalize that method to commercial-size silicon PV modules, mirroring by the approach already used for module-level spectral responsivity measurements described in IEC 60904-8:2014. The proposed method is motivated by inclusion in the currently ongoing revision of IEC 61853-2, providing research centers and testing laboratories with an additional option to perform IAM measurements indoors. The reproducibility of the proposed method is addressed in this work via interlaboratory comparison with a different measurement method for the same quantity and with a detailed uncertainty analysis.</description></item><item><title>Effect of Encapsulant Degradation on Photovoltaic Modules Performances Installed in Different Climates</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10835212</link><description>A damage analysis was conducted on photovoltaic modules with identical bill of materials exposed to different climates: Cfb moderate and Af tropical, according to the K&#246;ppen-Geiger climate classification. The combination of high temperature, relative humidity, and high ultraviolet (UV) radiation was the cause of severe degradation for the modules exposed to tropical climates (TR), whereas the module exposed to a moderate climate did not experience a significant loss in performance. The modules installed in TR, on the contrary, showed significant power degradation after approximately 8 years of exposure, primarily attributed to acetic acid-related degradation modes. Encapsulant samples were extracted from the selected modules and characterized to determine changes in chemical structure, thermal stability, and consumption of additives and stabilizers. The results of qualitative additive analysis showed that the UV absorber was no longer detectable in the front encapsulant extracted from modules exposed in TR. The consumption of the stabilizers was considered as the main cause of reduction of molar mass. The presence of acetic acid was evident in both electroluminescence images and ion chromatography results. While differential scanning calorimetry successfully detected a reduction in molar mass, thermogravimetric analysis, and infrared spectroscopy proved unsuitable for identifying chain scission phenomena.</description></item><item><title>Growing Panes: Investigating the PV Technology Trends Behind Frequent Early Failures in Modern Glass&#8211;Glass Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10847304</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) module materials and technologies continue to evolve as module manufacturers and buyers try to minimize costs, maximize performance, and speed deployment. Both silicon and thin film modules are converging toward similar &#8764;3 $\text{m}^{2}$ glass&#8211;glass designs with thinner glass sheets to increase power output while reducing module weight, and both types are increasingly mounted on single-axis trackers. At the same time, an increasing number of PV sites have been reporting spontaneous glass breakage in early life systems deployed with these &#8220;big, floppy modules.&#8221; In this article, we identify the concurrent module changes that may be contributing to increased early failure, explain the trends, and discuss their reliability implications. We suggest that larger, thinner glass sheets along with variations in heat treatment and quality may be contributing to glass vulnerability. We note that trends toward weaker or back-mounted frames may also be contributing to module failures, especially for &#8220;extra-extra-large&#8221; modules mounted on trackers. Combinations of these trends may have pushed modules to a threshold at which increasing early failures are causing the front edge of the &#8220;bathtub curve&#8221; to re-emerge. Current qualification testing appears to be ineffective for catching these early failures in new module designs, and module buyers do not have enough reliability information&#8212;or cannot prioritize such information&#8212;during module procurement. Additional research is needed to identify the field conditions leading to glass breakage and if there is one or multiple limiting flaws in new module designs causing glass breakage. Early failures may be mitigated by returning to more robust designs or ensuring better module testing and quality assurance.</description></item><item><title>Investigating the Crosslinking, Degradation, and Adhesion Behavior of Photovoltaic Encapsulants Under Thermal Accelerated Aging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804171</link><description>Degradation of photovoltaic (PV) module encapsulant characteristics that lead to mechanical embrittlement and delamination remains a cause of failure in solar installations. A multiscale reliability model connecting the encapsulant mechanical and fracture properties to the degraded molecular structure and interfacial bonding to adjacent solar cell and glass substrates was previously published. The model, developed primarily for poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) acetate (EVA) encapsulants, remains to be experimentally validated. Determining the degradation and crosslinking kinetics of alternative encapsulants, such as polyolefin elastomer (POE) and EVA/POE/EVA composites (EPE), can generalize the model. In this work, we subject fully cured EVA, POE, and EPE encapsulants to accelerated thermal aging to determine how high temperatures impact reaction kinetics. An increase in gel content (crosslinking) and decrease in crystallinity of the encapsulants under hot-aerobic (90 &#176;C, 22% RH) and hot-anaerobic (90 &#176;C, sealed in N2 air) aging were observed, even in the absence of UV and crosslinking initiators. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)-attenuated total reflectance analysis showed insignificant encapsulant degradation, demonstrating the critical role of UV and moisture in accelerating degradation. Adhesion testing performed on coupon-level specimens (cell/encapsulant/glass laminates) showed decreases in adhesion energy, Gc, from 5000 h of hot-dry (90 &#176;C, &#8764;1% RH) and hot-humid (90 &#176;C, 60% RH) aging. POE coupons demonstrated the best stability, followed by EPE then EVA. For EVA and POE, hot-humid aged coupons experienced a larger decrease in Gc due to enhanced hydrolytic degradation. Hot-dry aging condition demonstrated that thermal degradation of the interface could be significant even if the encapsulant experiences negligible degradation in the absence of UV and elevated humidity.</description></item><item><title>Comparison of Reflector Materials for a Vertical Bifacial Solar Canal</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829584</link><description>In this article, we assessed five reflector materials for hypothetical vertical bifacial arrays as a solar canal technology option. We screened the materials (CoverMax, CoverTuff, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) Poly, polyester canvas, and Vivosun aluminized Mylar) for reflectivity, tensile strength to minimum mounting load, vapor barrier performance to reduce evaporation, and energy production. Vivosun had the highest reflectivity (albedo of 0.87&#8211;0.93) and increased annual energy production more than 40% compared with a system without reflector, but plastically deformed under tensile strength testing. All materials reduced evaporation at least fivefold compared with the control. Following our preliminary assessment, we calculated the levelized cost of electricity of a hypothetical vertical bifacial array with two height configurations (short system at 2 m and tall system at 3 m) and four hybrid reflectors (fabricated from strong base layer materials with a top layer of Vivosun) and compared these results with systems with single-material reflectors and with systems without reflectors. We found that the tall system with a hybrid reflector made from PVC Poly had the lowest levelized cost of electricity. However, when considering other performance metrics, such as tensile strength and vapor barrier performance, a hybrid reflector made from CoverMax emerged as the best candidate of the options considered.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Soiling Estimation and Optimized Cleaning Strategies for Industrial Rooftop PV Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10847915</link><description>The accumulation of dust and dirt on solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, known as soiling, reduces energy generation and conversion efficiency of a PV plant. Therefore, regular cleaning is essential to maintain optimal plant performance and economic viability. Fixed-interval cleaning schedules become uneconomical during periods such as low-insolation, rainy, or cloudy events. This study proposes a data-driven method to estimate the soiling ratio (SR) for a 504-kWp rooftop PV plant in India using power, temperature, and irradiance data. A PV panel temperature estimation model is employed, based on ambient temperature and solar irradiance, which simplifies the process by eliminating the need for direct temperature measurements. The analysis reveals that regular cleaning is essential despite rainfall, with energy losses due to soiling ranging from 32% to 47% across inverters, with soiling rates of 4.6&#8211;5.5% per day. A dynamic cleaning schedule, considering weather and soiling conditions, was developed to reduce these losses. Economic evaluation demonstrated that manual cleaning following the proposed dynamic schedule is cost effective, with profit margins of 48&#8211;77%, comparing energy gain and cleaning cost. Compared with fixed-interval cleaning, the proposed method maintained the same average SR but yielded 25&#8211;49% higher profitability across inverters.</description></item><item><title>A Single Voltage Sensor Bypass Switch-Based Photovoltaic Fault Localization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10877760</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) energy systems are becoming an important source of sustainable energy. However, undiscovered faults within these systems may cause significant efficiency reduction. Localizing these faults to the module level is important for a quick fault diagnosis and maintaining the overall system efficiency. This article presents a novel method to localize intrastring, line-ground, cross-string, and partial shading faults in an $N$ &#215; $M$ PV system down to the module level. The approach utilizes a single voltage sensor in the combiner box of the PV system and $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ bypass switches per string to bypass the connected PV modules during faults. The technique initially relies on identifying the faulty string. Once this string is determined, the voltage associated with each module in that string is found. Each module's voltage in that string is obtained by measuring the string voltage after bypassing each module corresponding to an activated switch. Subsequently, the resulting linear equations are solved to obtain the voltage of each module in the faulty string. The technique is verified using simulation and an experimental setup for a 5 x 4 small-size PV system. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the technique can accurately localize faulty modules with only $N$ voltage samples of the faulty string. The proposed method is robust to variations in the maximum power point tracking algorithm, ensuring faults are localized effectively in real-time.</description></item><item><title>Electrical and Thermal Characteristics Optimization in Interposer-Based 2.5-D Integrated Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10735253</link><description>In this work, a comprehensive analysis and optimization method of electrical and thermal characteristics in 2.5-D integrated circuits (ICs) is performed, including rapid heat distribution modeling, integrated voltage regulator (IVR) chip modeling, and power delivery network (PDN) modeling. Based on the proposed method, chiplet placement, decoupling placement, and IVR parameter settings that compromise the total PDN impedance, IVR impedance, and thermal distribution characteristics can be obtained. First, a rapid thermal analysis method for multiple heat sources is proposed by integrating the equivalent thermal resistance method and commercial tools. The thermal method significantly improves the computational efficiency and reduces the memory usage. Then, we analyze the electrical characteristics of a typical low dropout (LDO) and model the complete 2.5-D PDN, including interposers, chiplets, IVRs, through-silicon vias (TSVs), bumps, decoupling capacitors, and other components. The electrical and thermal problems in the 2.5-D system are formulated and a Metropolis rule-based algorithm is used to derive optimal solutions. Finally, the optimal placement schemes and parameter settings are iterated under different constraints. This method allows for the adjustment of target impedance, noise current, thermal limit, and other constraints based on varying practical situations. In the time-domain analysis, it can be found that the capacitance value is reduced while maintaining the power supply performance. With high accuracy in thermal and electrical modeling, this work provides an in-depth reference for the co-design of chiplet-based 2.5-D ICs.</description></item><item><title>A Single-Ended High-Voltage-Compliant 11-bit Current-Steering Digital-to-Analog Converter for Adaptive Noise Cancellation in Power Over Data Line Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769052</link><description>Automotive Ethernet is considered to be the backbone of future in-vehicle data communication. One main feature is its ability to simultaneously transmit data and energy via power over data lines (PoDL). This article proposes the design of a single-ended high-voltage (HV)-compliant 11-bit current-steering digital-to-analog converter (DAC). The converter is tailored for the utilization as digitally controlled current source in an adaptive noise-cancellation filter for PoDL networks. Designed in an HV-compliant 180-nm bipolar complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (BiCMOS) semiconductor technology, the DAC features a monolithically combined topology of two identical 10-bit low-voltage (LV) current-steering DACs supplied at 1.8 V and two complementary HV-compliant output current stages. Main design features of the segmented LV DAC are the utilization of single-ended current cells with an optimized switching logic, proposed to enhance the cells transient performance and energy efficiency. Furthermore, a newly derived  $Q^{4}$  asymmetric rotated walk switching scheme is investigated. At a maximum output voltage of 60 V, the proposed DAC can deliver a bidirectional output current with the amplitudes of up to 500 mA. The proposed DAC exhibits the highest voltage compliance combined with the highest output current compared with related works. It also features the second highest resolution. Operated at a sample rate of 10 MS/s with a resolution of 11 bit, a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 57.8 dB could be measured for a synthesized single tone at 100 kHz, as well as a maximum integral nonlinearity (INL) error of 1.61 LSB and a differential nonlinearity (DNL) error of 1.05 LSB.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Parallel Feed-Forward Current Ripple Rejection (PFFCRR) Technique for High Load Current High PSRR nMOS LDOs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769013</link><description>There is a significant demand in systems-on-chip (SoCs) for a high-power efficiency low-dropout regulator (LDO) that provides lower dropout voltage, higher load current, and low quiescent current. A high-power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) at the mid-to-high frequency band (0.1&#8211;10 MHz) is crucial for LDO to generate low-noise power supplies when driven by switching power converters. However, this presents a significant challenge to enhancing the PSRR since the pass field-effect transistor (FET) operates in the deep triode region at high-current and dropout conditions. In this article, a parallel feed-forward current ripple rejection (PFFCRR) technique is proposed to improve the PSRR performance regardless of the operation region of the nMOS pass FET. The proposed approach senses the supply-induced current ripple and cancels the original ripple through a current path that runs parallel to the nMOS pass FET. The proposed LDO is fabricated in a 180-nm BCD process. The proposed LDO achieves a PSRR better than &#8722;35 dB up to 10 MHz at 300-mV dropout voltage with 0.5-A load current and a load capacitor of  $2.2~\mu $ F. The PFFCRR approach achieves a PSRR improvement of 18 dB at 1 MHz at 100-mV dropout voltage with a 2.15-A load current when the pass FET operates in the deep triode region. Moreover, the proposed LDO enhances the transient performance with an overshoot and an undershoot of 40.54 and 36.45 mV, respectively, against  $\Delta {I}_{\text {LOAD}}$  of 1 A with a slew rate of 1 A/ $\mu $ s.</description></item><item><title>A 28-Gb/s Single-Ended PAM-4 Transceiver With Active-Inductor Equalizer and Amplitude- Detection LSB Decoder for Memory Interfaces</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10767360</link><description>This study proposes a power-efficient 28-Gb/s single-ended four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) transceiver (TRX) for next-generation memory interfaces. In the transmitter (TX), an active-inductor equalizer (EQAI) is utilized, while in the receiver (RX), an amplitude-detection least significant bit (LSB) decoder is employed. In the TX, conventional equalization techniques consume substantial power owing to the inclusion of additional components and strong driving power required to mitigate channel-induced intersymbol interference (ISI). However, the proposed EQAI achieves a bandwidth extension up to the Nyquist frequency through gain boosting while reducing hardware costs and minimizing the driving strength. This results in a simple structure with operational efficiency, facilitating low power consumption and a compact area compared with conventional TX equalizers. In PAM-4 RX, the power dissipation is proportional to the clock buffer and the number of comparators used for data decoding. To improve the hardware cost and the power usage in the RX, the proposed RX design utilizes an amplitude-detection LSB decoder, which reduces the number of comparators and comprises a one-stage structure by detecting the amplitude differences between the reference and input voltages during LSB decoding. This ensures the hardware cost and power consumption improvement while implementing a one-tap direct decision feedback equalizer (DFE). The TRX for memory interfaces is optimized for low-power performance by employing these methods, resulting in a notable energy efficiency of 0.96 pJ/bit. This structure is fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS technology, and the core area of the TRX occupies 0.0053 mm2.</description></item><item><title>Design and Analysis of a 26&#8211;32-GHz 6-bit Passive Vector Modulation Phase Shifter for CMOS Bidirectional Transceiver</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753092</link><description>This article presents a 26&#8211;32-GHz 6-bit bidirectional passive vector modulation phase shifter (PVM-PS) in 40-nm CMOS for phased array systems.

This work presents a low-power 0.031 mm $^{2}~3$ -MHz bandwidth noise-shaping (NS) successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) tailored for implantable biosensor applications. A highly energy- and area-efficient reset-free residue-processing scheme is proposed. This scheme facilitates noise transfer function (NTF) optimization by enabling control over complex poles. It establishes a unique auxiliary feedback path from the infinite impulse response (IIR) back to the finite impulse response (FIR) by eliminating the need for the FIR filter&#8217;s reset phase. This auxiliary feedback loop, which could not be achieved in previous FIR-IIR structures, is a key enabler for achieving high energy efficiency and design flexibility. The in-band quantization noise suppression is boosted by the proposed complex conjugate poles optimization technique, while a low  $kT/C$  input-referred noise has resulted. The prototype, fabricated in 65-nm CMOS technology with a 7-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC), consumes  $370~\mu $ W from a 1-V supply and occupies an active area of only  $0.17\times 0.18$  mm (0.031-mm2). Operating at an 80-MHz oversampling frequency, the proposed ADC achieves a signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 70.2 dB over a 3 MHz bandwidth, demonstrating its small area, high efficiency, and high performance for implantable biosensor applications that require high data rates.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Design of Ripple-Free Bandgap Reference Circuit With p-n-p Bipolars</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10706624</link><description>This article presents a chopperless ripple-free low-noise bandgap reference (BGR) circuit in a traditional CMOS process that uses only p-n-p bipolars. Almost all chopperless bandgap structures require the use of n-p-n bipolars in special twin well processes, and they are prone to substrate and power supply noise. This work has targeted the &#8220;chopperless&#8221; scenario in p-n-p bipolar-based bandgap architecture by presenting a low offset temperature coefficient (TC) preamplifier design in the error amplifier. Notably, the design&#8217;s worst case power supply rejection (PSR) was &#8220;derived, simulated, and experimentally measured&#8221; to be &#8722;35 dB at 7.5 MHz, which is above par with any previously designed circuits. Furthermore, for the first time, an extensive mathematical analysis is provided for the self-bias loop, which is traditionally used to suppress the systematic offset. The prototype implemented in the TSMC 65-nm low-power (LP) process is untrimmed and occupies an active area of 0.0226 mm2 while drawing a current of  $48.36~\mu $ A from 0.9-V supply. Measurement results of 28 chips and 10 chips in two different wafers show that the achieved nominal reference voltage of 500 mV has an average accuracy of 27 ppm/&#176;C, similar to the curvature uncompensated BGR that uses chopping. Furthermore, the measured noise spectral density at 1-Hz offset is  $10~\mu $ V/ $\sqrt {(}\text {Hz})$ , which is the state of the art among chopperless bandgap structures.</description></item><item><title>MASL-AFU: A High Memory Access Efficiency 2-D Scalable LUT-Based Activation Function Unit for On-Device DNN Training</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10766892</link><description>On-device deep neural network (DNN) training faces constraints in storage capacity and energy supply. Existing works primarily focus on optimizing the training of convolutional and batch normalization (BN) layers to improve the compute-to-communication (CTC) ratio and reduce the energy cost of off-chip memory access (MA). However, the training of activation layers remains challenging due to the additional off-chip MA required for derivative calculations. This article proposes MASL-AFU, an architecture designed to accelerate the activation layer in on-device DNN training. MASL-AFU leverages nonuniform piecewise linear (NUPWL) functions to speed up the forward propagation (FP) in the activation layer. During the error propagation (EP) process, retrieving derivatives from a lookup table (LUT) eliminates the need for redundant retrieval of the input data used in FP. By storing LUT indices instead of the original activation inputs, MASL-AFU significantly reduces and accelerates MA. Compared to other activation function units, MASL-AFU offers up to a  $5.8\times $  increase in computational and off-chip MA efficiency. In addition, MASL-AFU incorporates two dimensions of scalability: data precision and the number of LUT entries. These scalable, hardware-friendly methods enhance MASL-AFU&#8217;s area efficiency by up to  $3.24\times $  and energy efficiency by up to  $3.85\times $ .</description></item><item><title>Falcon: A Fused-Layer Accelerator With Layer-Wise Hybrid Inference Flow for Computational Imaging CNNs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745739</link><description>Computational imaging (CI) has advanced significantly due to the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Its edge deployment relies on layer fusion to offload the monstrous external memory access (EMA) of feature maps, necessitating the handling of overlapped features either through reusing or recomputing them. Depending on how the boundary-handling strategy is organized, the induced computing complexity and EMA can be optimized. However, state-of-the-art CI accelerators primarily apply homogeneous inference flows, which employ a single overlap-handling strategy throughout the fused layers, limiting their ability to balance computation and data access. In this article, we explore layer-wise optimization in fused-layer CNNs by exploiting hybrid-strategy inference flows and devising a corresponding computing architecture. We categorize layer-wise strategies and put forward a layer-wise hybrid inference flow (LHIF) to integrate their advantages, and we propose an optimization procedure that explicitly analyzes essential figures of merit (FoMs), including throughput, EMA, and energy efficiency. Furthermore, we develop a high-throughput accelerator&#8212;Falcon&#8212;to efficiently support LHIF under massive parallelism, especially with a time-division-multiplexing (TDM) buffer interface that enables seamless access to feature maps stored in an interleaved manner. Layout results show that the accelerator, delivering 41 TOPS with 1.5 MB of feature-map buffers, supports LHIF while increasing the die area by only 1.4% and power consumption by only 0.7%. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the versatility of LHIF in working scenarios at operational, design, and system levels. Compared with using homogeneous inference flows, the proposed LHIF achieves Pareto optimality with up to  $2.28\times $  higher throughput and  $3.5\times $  lower EMA.</description></item><item><title>RCU- 2m: A VLSI Radix- 2m Cubic Unit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747396</link><description>Cubic operations are among the most used arithmetic operations in many applications that demand higher order simultaneous operand computation, such as cryptography and bicubic polynomial interpolation. This article proposes a novel VLSI radix- $2^{m}$  cubic unit (RCU- $2^{m}$ ) capable of processing cubic operations at m bits simultaneously, with m values of 2 (RCU-4), 3 (RCU-8), and 4 (RCU-16). RCU-16 emerges as the most area-efficient configuration, surpassing RCU-8 and notably outperforming RCU-4. In the 8-bit scenario, RCU-16 achieves remarkable area savings, surpassing the literature&#8217;s proposed cubic unit by  $11.58\times $ . Across all configurations, RCU- $2^{m}$  consistently outperforms the automatically selected cube unit, with energy savings ranging from  $1.04\times $  to  $2\times $ . In application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based analyses, RCU-16 consistently exhibits superior performance in both area and energy savings compared with RCU-4, RCU-8, and solutions from the literature. These findings emphasize the importance of adopting radix- $2^{m}$  configurations, particularly RCU-16, for optimal energy-constrained VLSI applications.</description></item><item><title>A Methodology for Datapath Energy Prediction and Optimization in Near Threshold Voltage Regime</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10788034</link><description>In this article, we propose a method for sizing an arbitrary combinational datapath to minimize its energy consumption. Our method involves deriving expressions for the components of energy consumption at both the stage and path levels. In this work, we identify overshoot energy ( $E_{\text {OS}}$ ) consumption as a previously unreported component contributing to energy consumption, particularly significant in the near/sub-threshold voltage regime. We determine that this  $E_{\text {OS}}$  consumption is proportional to the input and output transition times and size of a logic gate at a particular stage of a datapath. We also observe that, for a given number of stages (N) and path effort, the total energy consumption is optimized when the stage effort (f) in a datapath is kept constant. Based on our observations and derivations of all the energy components and the requirement for a constant &#8220;f&#8221; in the datapath, we develop a method to minimize the energies of a logic circuit while maintaining the timing closure requirement. We determine that the non-critical paths (NCPs) must be sized to a minimum &#8220;f&#8221; while maintaining the timing requirements. We verified our models on several ISCAS and EPFL benchmark circuits with an average reduction of 28.1% (41.2%) and 19.2% (28.4%) in energy consumption [figure of merit (FoM)], respectively. The proposed methodology predicts the total energy consumption at a stage and path level of N-stage logic, with only one-time SPICE simulation on a single stage, with a maximum error of 1.3% and 1.62%, respectively, against SPICE simulations. The simulations are performed in Synopsys HSPICE environment with ST Microelectronics 65 nm CMOS and 28 nm FDSOI technology nodes, resulting in a very good agreement with the developed methodology.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Hardware Accelerator Based on Medium Granularity Dataflow for SpTRSV</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10759529</link><description>Sparse triangular solve (SpTRSV) is widely used in various domains. Numerous studies have been conducted using CPUs, GPUs, and specific hardware accelerators, where dataflows can be categorized into coarse and fine granularity. Coarse dataflows offer good spatial locality but suffer from low parallelism, while fine dataflows provide high parallelism but disrupt the spatial structure, leading to increased nodes and poor data reuse. This article proposes a novel hardware accelerator for SpTRSV or SpTRSV-like directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The accelerator implements a medium granularity dataflow through hardware-software codesign and achieves both excellent spatial locality and high parallelism. In addition, a partial sum caching mechanism is introduced to reduce the blocking frequency of processing elements (PEs), and a reordering algorithm of intranode edges&#8217; computation is developed to enhance data reuse. Experimental results on 245 benchmarks with node counts reaching up to 85392 demonstrate that this work achieves average performance improvements of  $7.0\times $  (up to  $27.8\times $ ) over CPUs and  $5.8\times $  (up to  $98.8\times $ ) over GPUs. Compared with the state-of-the-art technique (DPU-v2), this work shows a  $2.5\times $  (up to  $5.9\times $ ) average performance improvement and  $1.7\times $  (up to  $4.1\times $ ) average energy efficiency enhancement.</description></item><item><title>A Programmable and Reconfigurable CMOS Analog Hopfield Network for NP-Hard Problems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10737881</link><description>Analog Hopfield networks perform continuous energy minimization, leading to efficient and near-optimal solutions to nonpolynomial (NP)-hard problems.

A programmable and reconfigurable analog Hopfield network is presented that addresses these challenges through a reconfigurable Manhattan architecture with a high-precision 14-bit floating-gate (FG) compute-in-memory (CiM) fabric. The network is implemented on a field programmable analog array (FPAA) and experimentally tested on three different NP-hard problems with different scaling challenges: Weighted Max-Cut (high connectivity and weight precision), traveling salesman problem (TSP) (high connectivity and medium weight precision), and Boolean Satisfiability/3SAT (low connectivity and weight precision) where it solved each problem optimally in microseconds.</description></item><item><title>Cost-Effective Analytical Models of Resistive Opens Defects in FinFET Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750047</link><description>FinFET technology has become an attractive candidate for high-performance and power-efficient applications. However, its susceptibility to defects increases due to the complexity of the process fabrications and smaller feature sizes. This article proposes compact and low-cost analytical models to evaluate the delay increase in FinFET-based circuits due to resistive open defects. The models rely on electrical simulations to precharacterize the circuit library. Analytical expressions are developed for the three types of resistive opens that may occur in FinFET-based logic cells using multifin and multifinger structures. These types of resistive opens include: a resistive open at the drain or source of the transistors (RODS), a resistive open affecting the gate of a single transistor, and a resistive open affecting the gates of both nMOS and pMOS transistors. Compact analytical models are also developed to evaluate the delay increase due to the resistive open defects under process variations. Independent and correlated process variations are taken into account. The analytical models have been validated against SPICE electrical simulations. The proposed analytical models can be used to evaluate the detectability of resistive open defects, significantly reducing the cost of dealing with different defect sizes. Potential applications of the developed analytical models are delineated. This work allows us to have higher quality and reliable electronic products.</description></item><item><title>A Histogram-Based Calibration Algorithm of Capacitor Mismatch for SAR ADCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10737885</link><description>The conversion accuracy of successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is mainly affected by the capacitor mismatch. In this brief, a histogram-based calibration technique is proposed, which does not require any additional analog circuitry. In this work, the method of partial fitting is used to detect irregular code densities, and construct a cost function to update the weight recursively. The prototype of the calibration is verified with a 12-bit SAR ADC manufactured in 28-nm standard CMOS process. At the sampling rate 50 MS/s, the measurement results indicate that the maximum spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) can be improved from 77.26 to 88.26 dB, using 10.6 fJ/conversion-step, including reference voltage buffer, with a low-frequency input signal.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Maintain Power Signature (MPS) Scheme With Reusable Current Generator for Powered Device (PD)</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10736935</link><description>The power over Ethernet (PoE) technology has gained intensive attention in networking market owing to the advantages of compactness, flexibility, and cost in application. The automatic maintain power signature (MPS) function specified by IEEE standard extracts the periodic pulsed current to enable applications requiring low power modes. However, a large driving capacity is required due to a large MPS current above 10 mA, sacrificing a certain area. This brief proposes an adaptive MPS scheme, which reuses existing class regulator and delay timer to source a pulsed MPS current to meet the MPS requirements, saving an area of 0.0104 mm2. The proposed MPS scheme has been fabricated in 0.18- $\mu $ m 120-V BCD process and the area is  $1.37\times 1.00$  mm2. The experimental results show that the proposed PoE interface draws a pulsed current with a period of 312 ms and 25.6% duty cycle to address the issue of MPS absence in very low-power standby modes.</description></item><item><title>A Harmonic-Suppressed GaN Power Amplifier Using Artificial Coupled Resonator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10767417</link><description>This brief presents an 11.5&#8211;17.5-GHz power amplifier (PA) with 32-dBm output power in a 0.25- $\mu $ m gallium nitride (GaN) process. Capacitively and inductively coupled resonators are used for impedance matching to achieve a flat in-band power gain and a high out-of-band rejection. Meanwhile, the output matching network provides a second-harmonic suppression to improve the average efficiency within the bandwidth of the PA. The measurements show that the proposed PA exhibits an output power of 31&#8211;32.5 dBm and a power gain of more than 10.5 dB from 11.5 to 17.5 GHz. Due to the matching networks providing convenient dc feed and dc block, the chip dimension is only  $2.1\times 1.1$  mm2, corresponding to a power density of 0.77 W/mm2. The proposed PA demonstrates a competitive fractional bandwidth and power density in GaN PA monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMICs).</description></item><item><title>A 10-Gb/s/lane, Energy-Efficient Transceiver With Reference-Less Hybrid CDR for Mobile Display Link Interfaces</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10718328</link><description>This brief presents an energy-efficient transceiver supporting a 10-Gb/s/lane display link interface between the application processor (AP) integrated circuits (IC) and timing controller (TCON)-embedded source driver IC for mobile applications. An embedded clocking scheme is adopted to save clock distribution power, which also reduces the required number of off-chip I/O channels. A transmitter (TX) sends 20-Gb/s aggregate data through two differential data lanes, and a receiver recovers a 5-GHz half-rate clock. The TX employs a latch-less serializer using divided clocks in a staggered phase, achieving energy efficiency of 0.43 pJ/b/lane. In the RX, a hybrid clock and data recovery (CDR) tracks a half-data rate with a digital loop filter (DLF) and subsequently locks the frequency and phase with an analog loop filter (ALF). By deactivating the DLF and edge deserializer once a coarse frequency lock is acquired, the RX achieves an energy efficiency of 0.53 pJ/b/lane. The prototype transceiver, fabricated using a 28-nm CMOS technology, occupies an active area of 0.196 mm2 and achieves an energy efficiency of 1.23 pJ/b/lane, including a charge-pump phase-locked loop (CP-PLL) with clock distribution.</description></item><item><title>A Combo EMI Suppression Scheme for Multimode PSR Flyback Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10715998</link><description>Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is an inevitable issue in power electronics applications. Although many kinds of solutions have been presented to attenuate EMI noise, there is still little research about the EMI suppression scheme utilized in multimode primary-side regulation (PSR) flyback converters. Targeting EMI regulation in multimode PSR flyback converter, a combo EMI suppression scheme comprised of frequency modulation and dual-slope gate driver is adopted to meet stringent EMI requirements, simplifying peripheral components and design of EMI filter. The proposed scheme is implemented in  $0.18~\mu $  m 5/40 V BCD process and occupies a die size (with pads) of  $1.05\times 0.8$  mm2.

By leveraging auto-rotation calibration and self-compensation strategies in the analog domain, the proposed technique demonstrates robust performance across PVT variations. Two additional sub-channels are involved in the TI quantization mechanism, where the continuous rotation of the sampling clock distribution ensures their operation in calibration mode. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed calibration, an  $8\times 8$  bit 8 GS/s TI-SAR ADC is designed and implemented in a 28-nm process and occupies an active area of 0.273 mm2, with each sub-channel SAR ADC covering only  $86\times 23~\mu $ m. Extensive simulation results validate the efficacy of RRC, demonstrating significant improvements in dynamic performance. Specifically, SNDR increases from 37.1 to 45.4 dB, while SFDR rises from 57.8 to 60.7 dB, as observed at the Nyquist input frequency.</description></item><item><title>A 225-&#956;W Interference-Tolerant Receiver With Shared Wireless LO and Envelope-Tracking Mixer Achieving -104-dBm Sensitivity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10810369</link><description>This article presents a 915-MHz interference-tolerant receiver (RX) with a shared wireless local oscillator (LO) and an envelope-tracking (ET) mixer for low-power Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. For applications featuring a large number of RXs, the deployment of a shared wireless LO can enhance the energy efficiency of the system. The proposed ET mixer retrieves phase-following (PF) LO pulses from the wireless LO, aligning them, respectively, with the peak and valley of the radio frequency (RF) input signal. This allows the RX to track the target peak and valley envelopes of the RF input signal, improving mixer gain and conversion quality (Q). Moreover, eliminating the integrated LO conserves system power and reduces area. The RX also employs intermediate-frequency (IF) calibration to derive an adaptive IF1 LO based on the uncertain frequency of the wireless LO, thus creating a known IF2 with a narrow bandwidth to enhance sensitivity, interference tolerance, and channel selectivity. Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the RX achieves a sensitivity of -104 dBm with a -50-dBm wireless LO, while occupying 0.2-mm2 active area and consuming  $225~{\mu }$ W at a 10-kb/s data rate. The achieved RX figure-of-merit (FOM) is 180 dB. The sensitivity loss is within 10 dB with the wireless LO power ranging from -69 to -30 dBm. With the -50-dBm wireless LO, the RX exhibits 44- and 32-dB tolerances to 100-kb/s and 5-Mb/s on-off-keying (OOK) interference with 5-MHz offset.</description></item><item><title>An Ultra-Low-Jitter Fast-Hopping Fractional-N PLL With LC DTC and Hybrid-Proportional Paths</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843985</link><description>This work presents an ultra-low-jitter fractional-N PLL capable of wideband fast hopping. There is an analog proportional path and a digital proportional/integral path in the PLL. The PLL is digital-path-dominant during settling and analog-path-dominant after settles; therefore, the fast-lock characteristic of the digital PLLs and the low-jitter characteristic of the analog PLLs are achieved. The frequency switching algorithm does not rely on the linearity of DCO&#8217;s tuning curve, nor rely on the hopping step between the previously locked frequency and the target frequency. The frequency detection is based on a high-speed counter, which uses the quadruple timing margin selection and can operate up to 20 GHz. The counter is integrated with a feedback clock generator, which is functionally the same as a multi-modulus divider. In addition, this work proposes an LC delay circuit as the coarse digital-to-time converter (DTC), which has better potential than the RC-based counterparts to reduce the phase noise of DTC and thereby reduce the jitter of fractional-N PLLs. The prototype is implemented in 28-nm CMOS process and occupies 0.21-mm2 core area. The measured hopping time is  $0.52~{\mu }$ s across a 3.5-GHz step with 80-ppm settling accuracy. The measured rms jitter (integrated from 1 kHz to 100 MHz) is 36.8 fs for the integer-N channel, 41.3 fs for the far-integer fractional-N channel, and 61.7 fs for the near-integer fractional-N channel. The measured near-integer fractional spur is -62.4 dBc. The measured power consumption is 34 mW.</description></item><item><title>A 5-MS/s 16-bit Low-Noise and Low-Power Split Sampling SAR ADC With Eased Driving Burden</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843815</link><description>This article presents a 16-bit 5-MS/s successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with the proposed split sampling (SS) technique. The SS decouples the sampling and conversion operations of the ADC, effectively addressing the tradeoff among the driving burden of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC), sampling noise, power, and bit-cycling speed. The SS consists of 2 20-pF sampling capacitors and a 1-pF DAC. The sampling capacitors sample the input with low noise and cancel the kT/C noise of the DAC, avoiding the preamplifier saturation issue and easing the noise aliasing. As the sampling capacitors track the input when the DAC is performing bit-cycling, the input driving is eased with the extended tracking time. The small DAC guarantees fast speed and low power. Moreover, statistical residue measurement (SRM) is employed to reduce the preamplifier&#8217;s noise and the quantization noise, efficiently improving the signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and the bit weight calibration accuracy. The ADC is fabricated in a 180-nm process and occupies an active area of 0.57 mm2. With the SS and SRM, the ADC samples at 5 MS/s and achieves a 93.7-dB SNDR with a 5.31-mW power consumption, yielding a high Schreier-figure-of-merit (FoM) of 180.4 dB.</description></item><item><title>A 140 dB-DR Light-to-Digital Converter Using Current-Domain Hybrid Zoom for Baseline Cancellation and Interference Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777019</link><description>Noninvasive optical sensing techniques, such as photoplethysmography (PPG) and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), provide great user comfort and obtain rich hemodynamic information in term of pulse oximetry, blood flow velocity, and blood vessel stiffness. Conventional optical sensor readouts have evolved toward higher dynamic range (DR) and power-efficiency. In addition to quasi-static baseline input signals, fast-varying interferences due to motion artifacts (MAs) or environment changes can also cause saturation. How to compensate or tolerate these disturbances efficiently is one of the prominent properties required in emerging optical sensors. This article presents a high DR, energy-efficient light-to-digital converter (LDC). The proposed LDC utilizes a second-order incremental delta-sigma modulator (I-DSM) for high resolution, while a power-scaling OTA is utilized to reduce power consumption of the main integrator. The current-domain static zoom (SZ) is exploited to cancel baseline currents for high DR, while the dynamic zoom (DZ) tracks and compensates the residual ac input current to prevent fast-varying interference from saturating the analog-front-end (AFE) during fine quantization. Fabricated in a standard  $0.18~\mu $ m CMOS process, the LDC achieves a very high DR of 140 dB in a 2 kHz bandwidth. Thanks to the power-scaling OTA, the signal-to-noise and distortion-ratio (SNDR) of the ac path reaches 94.55 dB with only  $44~\mu $ W from a 1.2 V supply. The benefits of SZ and DZ have been validated by chest PPG measurement with significant MAs.</description></item><item><title>A 160-MHz BW 68-dB SNDR 36.2 mW Continuous-Time Pipelined &#916;&#931; ADC With DAC Image Prefiltering</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10817558</link><description>This article reports a continuous-time (CT) pipelined delta-sigma ( $\Delta \Sigma $ ) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) featuring a proposed prefiltering scheme to tackle the DAC image issue. We introduce a fast-shunting route for high-speed DAC image current with a passive RC low-pass filter (LPF) on the quantization (QTZ) path. Together with another LPF on the signal path to align the delay, the CT front-end stage provides a residue signal with a small amplitude and smooth edges, relaxing the linearity requirements on the residue amplifier (RA) and the back-end stage. Specifically, the RC delay in the two LPFs is tracked over process variation, relaxing the signal leakage to the back end. For the back-end stage, we use an all-pass filter (APF) analog delay in a second-order CT cascade of integrators with feedforward (CIFF)  $\Delta \Sigma $  modulator (DSM) with an input feedforward path. Such an APF can restore the unity signal transfer function (STF) under the influence of excess loop delay (ELD), thus simplifying the matching requirement between analog and digital domains&#8217; transfer functions. Prototyped in a 28-nm CMOS process, the proposed ADC operates with a clock of 3.2GHz, occupying an active area of 0.104 mm2. It exhibits a 72-dB dynamic range (DR) and a 68.5-dB peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) over a 160-MHz bandwidth (BW). The modulator consumes 36.2 mW, yielding 165-dB Schreier figure-of-merit (FOMs) based on the SNDR.</description></item><item><title>A Single-Stage Bias-Flip Regulating Rectifier With Fully Digital Duty-Cycle-Based MPPT for Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758432</link><description>Piezoelectric energy harvesting (PEH) has been considered a promising solution for replacing conventional batteries to power wireless sensors. A complete PEH system typically includes three stages: ac-dc rectification, maximum power point tracking (MPPT), and output voltage regulation to power the load circuits. Unfortunately, most prior works focus only on the first one or two stages. A few employ three, but unfortunately, they are in cascaded stages, which results in cascaded power efficiency loss. This article proposes a single-stage bias-flip MPPT regulating rectifier (BMRR), which integrates the active bias-flip rectification, MPPT, and output voltage regulation into one stage. The proposed BMRR transfers energy from the piezoelectric transducer (PT) directly to the output capacitor by employing fewer switches, removing the conventional bridge rectifier, and eliminating cascaded energy loss. In addition, the design was implemented in a fully digital fast-MPPT technique based on an improved duty-cycle-based (DCB) algorithm to let the PT voltage jump to the maximum power point (MPP) in only one step. The proposed BMRR rectifier was fabricated in a 180-nm BCD process. The measured results show 930% power enhancement compared to a full bridge rectifier (FBR) and 92.5% end-to-end (E2E) efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Pseudo Hysteretic Controlled Gap Time Modulated Isolated DC-DC Converter With Common-Mode Transient Immunity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787447</link><description>A pseudo hysteretic controlled gap time modulated isolated dc-dc converter is presented. A pseudo hysteretic controller is designed to bound the output voltage with fast load transient and small output voltage ripple. It implements gap time modulation based on the load current and is used to adjust the power delivered by a Class-D power amplifier (PA) with high efficiency. A high-impedance load shift keying (LSK) scheme is also proposed with common-mode transient immunity (CMTI) to complete the global feedback loop without requiring an additional transformer or capacitor. The prototype is implemented in a standard 65-nm CMOS process. With an input voltage of 2.5 V, the proposed converter generates an isolated output voltage that ranges from 1.8 to 2.2 V with a peak efficiency of 73.3% and an output voltage ripple of only 20 mV. With a load current transient step of 40&#8211;150 mA, this converter demonstrates unobservable overshoot and undershoot. CMTI is demonstrated with common-mode transients (CMTs) that measure +8 and &#8722;12 kV/ $\mu $ s.</description></item><item><title>High-Efficiency Ultrasound Energy Harvesting Interface With Auto-Calibrated Timing Control From &#8722;25 &#176;C to 85 &#176;C</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777066</link><description>This work presents a high-efficiency ultrasound energy harvesting interface with auto-calibrated timing control, featuring: 1) the proposed  $C_{\text {P}}$  auto-calibration, consisting of the half bias-flip time ( $t_{\text {half}}$ ) detection and adaptive closed-loop time calibration (ACTC) to improve the system&#8217;s robustness against piezoelectric transducer (PZT) materials and environmental variations; 2) the proposed charge recycling (CR) bootstrapping driver to reduce conduction loss and improve the  $C_{\text {P}}$  auto-calibration accuracy as well as the peak voltage flipping efficiency ( $\eta _{\text {flip}}$ ); and 3) the proposed coarse detection and fine calibration technique to eliminate the inherent timing offset and increase the acceptable input excitation frequency range. The fabricated chip prototype in 0.18- $\mu $ m silicon on insulator (SOI) CMOS process can adapt to both PZT5A (nominal  ${C_{\text {P}}}~{\sim }~114$  pF) and PZT5H (nominal  ${C_{\text {P}}}~{\sim }~190$  pF) and is capable of operating over a wide temperature range from  ${-} 25~{^{\circ }}$ C to  $85~{^{\circ }}$ C. The proposed  $C_{\text {P}}$  auto-calibration and CR bootstrapping driver can improve the  $\eta _{\text {flip}}$  to as high as 93.6% at an output power of  $496.6~{\mu }$ W. With the proposed coarse detection and fine calibration technique, this work demonstrates a high measured peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 94.5%, corresponding to a ~23% improvement when compared with the prior ultrasound energy harvesting interface while achieving a favorable figure of merit (FoM) of  $8.13{\times }$ .</description></item><item><title>A Closed-Loop EMI Regulated GaN Power Converter With In Situ EMI Sensing and Global Excess-Spectrum Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843842</link><description>As electromagnetic interference (EMI) standards evolve from the rules-based approach to the risk-based alternate, online EMI assessment and control become critical for lifetime risk management. With such a trend, this article presents an online closed-loop EMI regulation for gallium-nitride (GaN) power converter. Specifically, a wide-bandwidth in situ EMI sensor is integrated to characterize the noise through autocovariance-based spectrum analysis. A stepwise random space sampling (SRSS) significantly compresses the sensing time without sacrificing the accuracy for real-time EMI spectral characterization. Based on the online measured noise, a global excess-spectrum modulator is devised to adaptively track, and hence, continuously regulate the maximum excess noise. A prototype chip was fabricated in a 180-nm BCD process, commanding two enhancement-mode GaN power switches at a nominal frequency of 2.8 MHz. The measurement results show that the integrated in situ EMI sensor can capture the EMI spectra with a 500-MHz sampling bandwidth and 1-mV sensing accuracy while reducing the sensing time by over 25 times. Compared to the commercial spectrum analyzer, it demonstrates a maximum discrepancy of 3 dB. The embedded global excess-spectrum modulator accomplishes a 9-kHz-resolution EMI regulation, dynamically optimizing the EMI control.</description></item><item><title>A 2.5&#8211;20 kS/s In-Pixel Direct Digitization ECoG Front End With Submillisecond Stimulation Artifact Recovery</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10807162</link><description>Neural stimulation is used routinely to diagnose and treat neurological disorders. The stimulation artifacts are, however, problematic for closed-loop neuromodulation therapy, which dynamically adjusts the electrical stimulation parameters based on real-time feedback from the recorded neural activity because they can cause saturation or prolonged recovery times in traditional recording front ends. This article presents a per-pixel second-order  $\Delta \Sigma $  analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for direct digitization of neural signals, which addresses the stimulation artifact recovery time in voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based quantizers with a fast-recovery, overrange-detecting phase quantizer. The ADC uses a pseudo-virtual ground feedforwarding (PVG FF) technique and a complementary input  ${G} _{\text {m}}$ -C filter with per-pixel decimation. It supports four recording modes covering 2.5&#8211;20 kS/s through a power-efficient, bandwidth-scalable continuous time  $\Delta \Sigma $  modulator. Fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process, this  $300\times 300~\mu $ m2 ADC achieves  $\gt 250\times $  faster (0.05&#8211;0.4 ms) stimulation artifact recovery time, enabling in-stimulation recording.

System- and circuit-level techniques are employed to improve energy efficiency while ensuring high-quality EEG recordings and accurate seizure detection. The wearable prototype includes digital active electrodes (DAEs) for high-dynamic-range (DR) recording, motion artifact removal (MAR), and feature extraction (FE), along with a central backend (BE) for patient-specific classification, wireless connectivity, and common-mode rejection (CMR) boosting. DAEs communicate through a time-shared data bus, minimizing wires and enabling flexible electrode placement, maximizing system scalability. Each DAE enhances recording quality with: 1) calibrated CMR boosting (&gt;80-dB common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) with 1- $M\Omega $  AE-to-AE mismatch); 2) SC notch filtering for power-line noise; 3) real-time electrode-tissue impedance (ETI) measurement for MAR and dc correction; and 4) an autoranging mechanism with 17-dB DR enhancement. In-AE FE cuts AE-to-BE communication power by 99.1%, while pulse-based frequency sampling reduces FE power by 92.1%. A neuromorphic multiplier-less adaptively boosted support vector machine (SVM) maintains high detection accuracy with 97.6% less classification power than conventional designs. The chip was implemented in 180-nm CMOS, and the wearable system components (DAE, wireless, and CMR boards) were miniaturized. Experimental testing showed IIRN ( $0.64~\mu V_{\text {rms}}$ , 0.5&#8211;100 Hz), adjustable gain/bandwidth, DR (80 dB), SNDR (74.5 dB), and CMRR (89.2 dB without mismatch, &gt;80 dB with mismatch). Measurement results also confirm the system&#8217;s effectiveness in motion artifact estimation and removal. In vivo measurements demonstrate the system&#8217;s efficacy and latency in detecting neurologically relevant events. Seizure detection results (96.4% sensitivity, 0.41 FPR, 1-s latency, zero SRAM usage) on prerecorded EEG data from 21 patients are also reported.

More specifically, in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), vision chips must be able to fulfill the tasks of low to medium complexity, such as feature extraction (FE) or region-of-interest (RoI) detection, with a sub-mW power budget imposed by the use of small batteries or energy harvesting. Mixed-signal vision chips relying on in- or near-sensor processing have emerged as an interesting candidate because of their favorable tradeoff between energy efficiency (EE) and computational accuracy compared with digital systems for these specific tasks. In this article, we introduce a mixed-signal convolutional imager system-on-chip (SoC) codenamed MANTIS, featuring a unique combination of large  $16{\times }16~4$ b-weighted filters, operation at multiple scales, and double sampling, well suited to the requirements of medium-complexity tasks.

However, previous CIMs were often designed for multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations, which presents a myriad of challenges when deploying graph convolutional networks (GCNs) on CIM macros. This work presents a compact 6T SRAM-based aggregation and combination CIM macro (ACCIM) using: 1) a cell array with compact 6T bitcells, local jump and computing cells (LJCCs), and sparse-tracking analog-to-digital converters (STADCs) to improve energy efficiency in both input sparsity and weight bit sparsity; 2) an LJCC and STADC to improve the signal margin; 3) a CIM macro architecture with an aggregation input unit (AGINU) to support both GCN aggregation and GCN combination/convolutional neural network (CNN) MAC; 4) a graph pruning algorithm that divides the graph data into memory-friendly subgraphs; and 5) an error modeling-based pre-training method to improve the inference accuracy. A fabricated 28-nm 16-kb charge-domain SRAM-CIM macro achieved an energy efficiency of 86.87 TOPS/W and an area efficiency of 2344 GOPS/mm2 for GCNs with 4-bit degree input, 8-bit features, and 15-bit output.</description></item><item><title>BEE-SLAM: A 65-nm 17.96-TOPS/W Location-Sharing-Based Multi-Agent Neuromorphic SLAM Accelerator for Swarm Robotics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10786265</link><description>Multi-agent (MA) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) has been rigorously explored to enhance map accuracy in swarm robotics. Although centralized MA SLAM systems, which depend on a server for complex computations in map optimization, have been extensively studied, the circuit-domain approaches to decentralized MA SLAM systems are still limited due to challenges such as limited memory capacity and security vulnerabilities in wireless inter-agent data transmission. Thus, we propose a BEE-SLAM accelerator, a location-sharing MA neuromorphic SLAM accelerator inspired by bee communication for decentralized MA SLAM systems. The location-sharing-based MA error correction (MAEC) is employed to attain accurate map results without loop closure with a 94.81% reduced number of operations compared to the global map-based MA SLAM. In addition, a  $7 {\times } 7$  pulsewidth modulation (PWM)-based hybrid mixed-signal/digital pose-cell (HY-PC) array with pseudo pose cells (PPCs) achieves  $2.04{\times }$  energy efficiency compared to the oscillatory pose-cell array. The test chip fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS technology achieves a peak energy efficiency of 17.96 TOPS/W under  $350 {\times } 450$  m outdoor exploration.</description></item><item><title>An Energy-Efficient Unstructured Sparsity-Aware Deep SNN Accelerator With 3-D Computation Array</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777513</link><description>Deep spiking neural networks (DSNNs), such as spiking transformers, have demonstrated comparable performance to artificial neural networks (ANNs). With higher spike input sparsity and the utilization of accumulation (AC)-only operations, DSNNs have great potential for achieving high energy efficiency. Many researchers have proposed neuromorphic processors to accelerate spiking neural networks (SNNs) with dedicated architectures. However, three problems still exist when processing DSNNs, including redundant memory access among timesteps, inefficiency in exploiting unstructured sparsity in spikes, and the lack of optimizations for new operators involved in DSNNs. In this work, an accelerator for deep and sparse SNNs is proposed with three design features: a 3-D computation array that allows parallel computation of multiple timesteps to maximize weight data reuse and reduce external memory access; a parallel non-zero data fetcher that efficiently searches non-zero spike positions and fetches corresponding weights to reduce computation latency; and a multimode unified computation scheduler that can be configured to maximize energy efficiency for spiking convolution (SCONV), spiking  $Q, K,~\text {and}~V$  matrix generation, and spiking self-attention (SSA). The accelerator is implemented and fabricated using 40-nm CMOS technology. When compared with state-of-the-art sparse processors, it achieves the best energy efficiency of 0.078 pJ/SOP and the highest recognition accuracy of 77.6% on ImageNet using the spiking transformer algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Hawkeye: A Point Cloud Neural Network Processor With Virtual Pillar and Quadtree-Based Workload Management for Real-Time Outdoor BEV Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10807164</link><description>Large-scale 3-D processing using the point cloud neural network (PNN) has become essential for applications such as an autonomous driving system. Among the various methods, pillar-based PNN is widely utilized for processing large-scale outdoor environments. However, due to the irregular and sparse nature of the point cloud compared to the regular and dense image, achieving high efficiency has been challenging in previous works. Inspired by the LiDAR mechanism that generates point clouds, this article proposes Hawkeye, a large-scale bird&#8217;s-eye-view (BEV) detection processor designed for end-to-end processing of pillar-based PNN. Hawkeye incorporates three key features: 1) a feature encoding core (FEC) that introduces virtual pillars (VPs), dynamically generating temporal pillars to facilitate continuous processing; 2) a map management core (MMC) that utilizes a quadtree-based workload management system, enabling region-of-interest (ROI)-based skipping to optimize computational efficiency; and 3) a low-precision neural engine (LPNE) that employs a bit-slice compute architecture with sign-magnitude (SM) representation, enhancing slice-level skipping (SLS) capabilities. Fabricated in Samsung&#8217;s 28-nm CMOS technology, Hawkeye achieves a performance of 44.2 frames per second (FPS) at 320 MHz on the PointPillars with the KITTI dataset. Furthermore, with the aid of ROI-based skipping and SM-based SLS, Hawkeye demonstrates an effective energy efficiency of 38.5 TOPS/W under 0.74 V and 40 MHz.</description></item><item><title>A Scalable BEV Perception Processor for Image/Point Cloud Fusion Applications Using CAM-Based Universal Mapping Unit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10807165</link><description>The integration of multi-sensor data like image and point cloud for information complementarity is crucial for 3-D perception scenarios like autonomous driving. Recently, bird&#8217;s eye view (BEV)-based sensor fusion is attracting more and more attention but the significant computational overhead constrains their widespread application at the edge. First, there are numerous irregular memory access operations in BEV fusion networks. For example, sparse convolutions (SCONVs) in the point cloud branch and irregular BEV plane mapping result in significant memory addressing and mapping overhead. Furthermore, multi-sensor fusion leads to rapid expansion of model size, making it difficult and expensive for single-chip solutions to meet the demands. Based on the above challenges, this work proposes an image and point cloud fusion processor with two highlights: a content addressable memory (CAM)-based deep fusion core to accelerate a variety of irregular BEV operations and chip-level parallelism design supporting flexible interconnect topology. The proposed chip is fabricated in 28-nm CMOS technology. Compared with existing image or point cloud accelerators, the proposed chip achieves higher frequency,  $2\times $  higher area efficiency, and  $2.61\times $  higher energy efficiency for sparse point cloud processing. To the best of authors&#8217; knowledge, this work is the first accelerator for BEV-based multi-modal fusion networks.</description></item><item><title>A 70&#8211;86-GHz Deep-Noise-Canceling LNA With Dual-Stage Noise Cancellation Using Asymmetric Compensation Transformer and 4-to-1 Hybrid-Phase Combiner</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10637256</link><description>In this article, a 70&#8211;86-GHz deep-noise-canceling low noise amplifier (LNA) is presented to reduce the noise contributions from the multi-stage amplifiers under low transistor  $g_{m}$  at mm-wave. Such an LNA consists of dual-stage noise-canceling topology, i.e., an asymmetric common-gate (CG)-based noise-canceling stage and a resistive feedback noise-canceling stage. The asymmetric compensation transformer (ACT) is utilized in the CG-based noise-canceling stage to compensate the amplitude and phase imbalances, thereby enhancing the noise-canceling ratio. In addition, the second stage based on resistive feedback noise-canceling operation with a 4-to-1 hybrid-phase combiner (HPC) is introduced to reduce the transistor noise contribution, especially improving noise performance at mm-wave band. Based on the aforementioned mechanism, a deep-noise-canceling LNA is implemented and fabricated using a conventional 40-nm CMOS technology. The proposed LNA exhibits a 4.8&#8211;6.5-dB noise figure (NF) within the operation frequency range of 70&#8211;86-GHz. The peak gain is 16.5 dB, while the peak input 1-dB compression point (IP $_{1\,\text {dB}}$ ) is &#8722;8.5 dBm. The power consumption is 25 mW under a 1.1-V supply, which occupies a compact core area of 0.085 mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 6.5-to-8-GHz Cascaded Dual-Fractional-N Digital PLL Achieving &#8722;52.79-dBc Fractional Spur With 50-MHz Reference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659739</link><description>This work presents a 6.5-to-8-GHz cascaded dual-fractional-N digital phase-locked loop (DPLL) that avoids fractional spur degradation in near-integer channels by utilizing two PLLs with fractional frequency control words (FCWs). The FCWs of the two PLLs are carefully selected to achieve the optimal fractional spur performance at the output. A 14-bit segmented digital-to-time converter (DTC) with a background nonlinearity calibration achieving a 0.05% integral nonlinearity (INL) is proposed for further fractional spur suppression. This work achieves an integrated jitter of 154.4 fs in integer-N mode and an integrated jitter of 190.8 fs in fractional-N mode, respectively. It consumes 14.2 mW with a 50-MHz reference, leading to a figure of merit (FoM) of &#8722;242.9 dB. The fractional spur at near-integer channel is as low as &#8722;52.79 dBc, and the reference spur is &#8722;72.4 dBc. This PLL is implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process, occupying 0.48-mm2 core area.</description></item><item><title>A 0.69-Noise-Efficiency-Factor 55&#215; -Preamp-Gain Dynamic Comparator With a Stacking FIA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659080</link><description>This article presents a fully dynamic, low-noise, low-power comparator. Its key highlight is the four-times current-reuse factor, which improves the pre-amplifier gain by at least two times without increasing the power consumption. This causes the proposed design to have a two-times smaller input-referred noise and a two-times better noise-efficiency factor (energy  $\times $  noise power). In prior comparators, the maximum current-reuse factor of the pre-amplifier was only two times. This small current-reuse factor limits the pre-amplifier gain to 30 times, which restricts the further improvement in the noise-efficiency factor. By contrast, this work stacks two floating inverter amplifiers (FIAs) in order to greatly increase the current-reuse factor to as large as four times. As a result, the pre-amplifier gain is increased by 55 times, which is helpful for improving the noise-efficiency factor. Implemented in a 28 nm CMOS process, the prototype comparator achieves a  $38~{\mu }$ V input-referred noise and a 0.48 pJ energy consumption per comparison under a 0.9 V supply. The noise-efficiency factor is as good as 0.69 nJ $\cdot \mu $ V2, which is three times better than the prior FIA-based comparator and 23 times better than the classic StrongArm latch (SA latch). This noise-efficiency factor is the best among all reported works so far.</description></item><item><title>An Isolated DC-DC Converter With Full-Duplex Communication Using a Single Pair of Transformers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10645969</link><description>This article presents a 200-MHz isolated dc-dc converter for simultaneous power and full-duplex data transfer using a single pair of transformers, for the applications of low-cost galvanic isolation. The converter operates at high frequencies using a self-oscillating topology and implements a full-duplex 4-frequency-shift keying (FSK) communication through primary-side capacitance modulation and secondary-side 1X/2X rectification. We propose an adaptive bias circuit to address the sub-harmonic oscillation issue and to minimize the power MOSFETon-resistance. The primary and secondary-side chips are fabricated in 0.18- $\mu $  m bipolar-CMOS-DMOS (BCD) process with a 12.9-mm2 PCB transformer pair. The overall circuit achieves a 37% peak efficiency with a maximum output power of 750 mW. It transfers 54-/18-Mb/s full-duplex data with a bit error rate (BER) below 10-6.</description></item><item><title>Area-Efficient Non-Binary LDPC Decoder With Column-Wise Trellis Min-Max Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684216</link><description>Considered a next-generation error-correction solution, non-binary low-density parity-check (NB-LDPC) codes exhibit remarkable correcting capabilities, outperforming binary counterparts for severe channel conditions. However, contemporary decoder designs encounter challenges due to the demanding hardware resources required by their high processing complexity. In this work, we propose a novel column-wise trellis min-max (CW-TMM) algorithm, which significantly reduces the sorter overheads in the existing TMM method without degrading the error-correcting power. We also deploy the message compression to the trellis-based algorithm for effectively reducing hardware costs, even allowing the storage-aware long codes by accommodating large-sized on-chip memories. Through the integration of advanced low-cost optimization schemes together, the prototype CW-TMM decoder in a 28-nm CMOS technology for 4-kB 0.9-rate NB-LDPC codes demonstrates a 54% reduction in on-chip memory size and a 63% decrease in decoding complexity, enhancing the area efficiency by more than 2.4 times than the state-of-the-art approaches.</description></item><item><title>Compute SNDR-Boosted 22-nm MRAM-Based In-Memory Computing Macro Using Statistical Error Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10642976</link><description>The accuracy of embedded non-volatile memory (eNVM) in-memory computing (IMC) designs is primarily limited by analog non-idealities. This article introduces a magnetoresistive random-access memory (MRAM) IMC macro in 22-nm featuring offset-compensating current sensing (OCCS) to reduce the static analog-to-digital converter (ADC) column mismatch and a low-overhead statistical error compensation (SEC) block compensating for non-linearity arising due to bitline/source-line (BL/SL) wire parasitics. Both assist in enhancing the bank-level compute signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio (SNDR). As the inner dimension of the matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) increases, the compute SNDR reduces due to increased location-dependent non-linearity arising from BL/SL wire parasitics. An SEC-enabled SNDR boost of 2.7&#8211;6 dB is obtained over different operating points. This boost can be balanced to achieve a substantial  $5\times $  reduction in energy per 1-b operation while incurring a modest SEC energy overhead of 0.8% and area overhead of 12.2%. Finally, the study demonstrates an SEC-enabled increase in neural network (NN) accuracy from 74.8% to 82.0% for CIFAR-10 by last layer mapping of ResNet-20, without resorting to noise-aware training.</description></item><item><title>A 1.8% FAR, 2 ms Decision Latency, 1.73 nJ/Decision Keywords-Spotting (KWS) Chip Incorporating Transfer-Computing Speaker Verification, Hybrid-IF-Domain Computing and Scalable 5T-SRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10638323</link><description>This article reports a keyword-spotting (KWS) chip with a significantly reduced false alarm rate (FAR) for voice-control edge devices. The key techniques are threefold: 1) transfer-computing speaker verification (SV)-assisted KWS that compresses the required parameters and enhances the KWS+SV computation efficiency while maintaining the KWS accuracy and reducing the overall FAR; 2) hybrid-IF-domain computing that handles both the analog and digital input features (IFs), alleviating the tradeoff between the computation power and system accuracy of the first layer; and 3) scalable 5T-SRAM array that sustains the leakage and read power when it is upscaled. Benchmarking with the state-of-the-art, our SV-assisted KWS prototyped in 28-nm CMOS achieves the best-in-class energy efficiency of 1.73 nJ/decision, a decision latency of 2 ms, and a FAR of 1.8%.

The proposed circuits achieve a 71% reduction in leakage power. Additionally, a detailed discussion on the trade-off between switching current increase and leakage current reduction is presented. The overhead of switching power is 0.3% and 1.9% for read and write operations, respectively. Simulation results show that our static random-access memory (SRAM) has actual power reduction when active rate is lower than 21% at  $25~^{\circ }$  C, 81% at  $75~^{\circ }$  C, and 100% at  $85~^{\circ }$  C or higher.

While variability dominates the failure probability, noise-induced bit flips in weakened bitcells lead to dynamic instability. We study both effects jointly in a unified SPICE simulation framework. Starting from a synthetic representation of process variations introduced in a previous work, we identify the cases of poor noise immunity that require thorough noise analyses. Relying on a rigorous and systematic methodology, we simulate them in the time domain so as to emulate a true data retention operation. Short times to failure, unacceptable for a practical ultra-low-power memory system application, are recorded. The transient bit-flip mechanism is analyzed and a dynamic failure criterion involving the unstable steady state is established. We conclude that, beyond static variability, the dynamic noise inflates defectiveness among SRAM bitcells. Then, a stochastic nonlinear model, fully characterizable from conventional deterministic SPICE simulations, is presented. We then leverage it to efficiently and accurately predict the mean time to failure with an analytical Eyring-Kramers formula, recently extended to account for the varying-noise behavior of nonlinear systems.</description></item><item><title>Compact Reconfigurable Dual-Band MMIC SPDT/SP4T Switches With On-Chip Coupled-Line Structure in GaN-on-SiC HEMT Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10767850</link><description>This paper presents the design and analysis of dual-band monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) switches, including a single pole double throw (SPDT) and a single pole four throw (SP4T). With a novel on-chip coupled-line (OCL) topology, the input signal can be switched into low- or high-band paths to create dual-band characteristics. By carefully selecting the electrical lengths of OCLs and device size for corresponding shunt-FETs, the operating frequencies for low- and high-bands can be determined. This brings about improved insertion loss (IL) and isolation (ISO) in a compact structure. With the proposed techniques, two switch prototypes have been designed and fabricated in a 0.25- $\mu $ m GaN-on-SiC process for high-power capability. The SPDT consists of a low-band path and a high-band path. It achieves an average IL/ISO of 1.0/32 dB with the best input 1-dB compression points (IP1dB) of 37.2 dBm at a low-band of DC-15 GHz; and an average IL/ISO of 2.0/28.5 dB with the best IP1dB of 32.8 dBm at a high-band of 20-40 GHz, respectively. The return loss is better than 11 dB for each port. The SP4T achieves a fully integrated dual-band transmit/receive (T/R) switch with doubled low-/high-band paths. It shows an average IL/ISO of 2.26/27.5 dB with the best IP1dB of 31.2 dBm at a low-band of 5-15 GHz; and an average IL/ISO of 2.7/26.5 dB with the best IP1dB of 30 dBm at a high-band of 20-30 GHz have been achieved, respectively. Better than 11.3 dB return loss is obtained for each port.

Unfortunately, the inherent quantization behavior and integral nonlinearity associated with the DTC mean that the aforementioned QE cannot be canceled exactly; inevitably, the residual error gives rise to additional PN and spurious tonal phenomena. This tutorial paper uses DTC macromodels to analyze and distinguish the DTC&#8217;s sources of nonideality and the distinct adverse spectral responses induced by them. Different DTC enhancement techniques are shown to mitigate certain types of nonideality. A comprehensive design strategy incorporating these techniques is proposed, which mitigates the revealed excess PN and spurs introduced by the DTC&#8217;s nonidealities. The enhanced DTC enables the fractional-N DPLL to approach the fractional-spur-free integer-N PN performance limit. Behavioral simulations at both DTC-block and PLL-system levels confirm our analysis.</description></item><item><title>A High-Frequency CMOS Meminductor Emulator for Spiking Neuron</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10681228</link><description>This research introduces a high-frequency CMOS meminductor, utilizing operational transconductance amplifiers and two grounded capacitors, thereby avoiding traditional components such as memristors, multipliers, and resistors.

The ADC is directly driven by the CCIA without a traditional driver stage. The folded path of the first stage in CCIA is sliced for reconfigurable noise levels. In addition, a single-stage floating inverter amplifier (FIA) assisted by the correlated-level-shifting (CLS) technique is employed in the switched-capacitor (SC)  $\Delta $  $\Sigma $  modulator for fully dynamic operation with sufficient DC gain.

To achieve this, event-driven SoCs that exploit the time-sparse nature of biosignals such as the electrocardiogram (ECG) have been proposed; they only process the signal when it shows activity. Such SoCs convert time-sparse biosignals into spike trains, on which spiking neural networks (SNNs) can perform event-driven signal classification. State-of-the-art event-driven SoCs, however, still suffer from poor area and power efficiency and use inflexible, hard-coded spike-encoding schemes. To improve on these challenges, this paper presents FREYA, an 8-channel event-driven SoC for end-to-end sensing of time-sparse biosignals. The proposed SoC consists of the following key contributions: 1) an 8-channel time-division-multiplexed level-crossing sampling (LCS) analog-to-spike converter (ASC) that encodes analog input signals into input spikes for an on-chip SNN; 2) an ASC spike-encoding algorithm that is fully programmable in resolution (4 to 8 bits) and conversion algorithm (offset and decay parameters); 3) an on-chip integrated, flexible SNN processor based on a programmable crossbar architecture, that allows for efficient event-driven processing, and that can be reconfigured towards multiple sensing applications; 4) a custom offline end-to-end training framework for the fast retraining of the spike-encoding algorithm and SNN architecture towards new applications or patient-dependent signal variations. A prototype IC has been fabricated in a 40nm CMOS technology. It has a per-channel active area of 0.023 mm2 (0.184 mm2 in total), a  $7\times $  improvement over the state of the art. For the use case of ECG-based QRS-labeling, a detection accuracy of 98.67% is achieved, while the system consumes  $20.8~\mu $ W per channel and achieves a latency of only 80 ms, thus paving the way for multi-channel, high-fidelity, event-driven SoCs in biomedical applications.</description></item><item><title>An 840-to-970 MHz Multimodal Wake-Up Receiver With a Q-Equalized Antenna-ED Interface and 2-Dimensional Wake-Up Identification</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10695452</link><description>The article introduces an antenna-envelope detector (ED) co-designed wake-up receiver (WuRX) that can automatically detect the frequency-hopping sequence from 840 to 970 MHz. Prototyped in 65nm CMOS, the WuRX supports three modes: 1) low-power mode that achieves &#8722;68 dBm sensitivity with 9.9nW power consumption, 2) Q-enhanced mode that provides 22 dB rejection to an on-off-keying (OOK) modulated pseudo-random-bit-sequence blocker at 10 MHz offset and 41 dB rejection to a continuous-wave one at 10 MHz offset, with a power consumption of  $39.6~\mu $ W and 3) 2-stage wake-up mode that combines the advantages of both the low-power mode and Q-enhanced mode, with a power consumption of 33.7 nW. These characteristics are achieved by exploiting 1) an antenna-ED interface where the Q-factor of the antenna is equal to the Q-factor of the capacitor to ensure a conjugate matching condition for the maximum available power transfer from the antenna to the ED, 2) a frequency tuner connected to the antenna-ED interface calibrated by a frequency-locked loop, and 3) a Q-booster reconfigured from the frequency tuner for boosting the passive gain and narrowing the bandwidth of the interface.</description></item><item><title>IIP2-Calibration-Free 5G NR Cellular Receiver Front-End With Mixer-Sharing Global N-Path Notch Filter Feedback Achieving +72 dBm IIP2</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10689721</link><description>In this article, a new input-referred second-order intercept point (IIP2)-calibration-free receiver (RX) front-end employing mixer-sharing N-path notch filter feedback is proposed for 5G new radio (NR) cellular applications. An RX front-end architecture with a high-Q N-path RF filtering low-noise amplifier (LNA) enhances the overall IIP2 performance of the RX via the blocker filtering. However, the local oscillator (LO) chain burden increases with the number of switches in the N-path filter. The main down-conversion mixers are reused as part of switches for the N-path notch filter, reducing the LO chain burden and current consumption. The RX front-end comprises a balun-LNA, main down-conversion passive mixers driven by 25% duty-cycle LO signals, isolation resistors, and transimpedance amplifiers. Additional high-pass filters, up-conversion mixers, and reused down-conversion mixers form the global N-path notch filter feedback. Fabricated using a 65 nm CMOS process, the RX front-end was primarily characterized for the mid band of 5G NR sub-6 GHz cellular applications.

It is constructed by structural and functional integration of the two dissimilar energy harvesting techniques, constituting a conformal design. The rectifying efficiency can be boosted by the hybrid power source excitation, thereby increasing DC output power compared to standalone power source. A fan-shaped omnidirectional antenna and a hybrid single shunt-diode rectifier are designed to realize energy receiving and rectifying, respectively. A prototype is implemented and measured. The receiving part can achieve 2.29-dBi peak gain and 0.92-dB non-roundness at 1.85 GHz. It can also work smoothly when the wind speed varies from 0 to 12 m/s. The RF-DC conversion efficiency at -20 dBm and AC-DC output voltage at 12 m/s are measured as 20% and 79 mV, respectively. When both RF and wind power sources are accessible, the hybrid DC output power of 1.0 uW can be obtained with -30-dBm RF power and 10m/s wind speed. Moreover, the output power at hybrid rectifying mode is higher than that of simply superimposed RF and wind energy. Efficiency gain of up to 182% can be achieved.

Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CN-MOSFETs) with high scalability, energy-efficiency, and low process thermal budget are attractive to realize high-dense monolithic three-dimensional (M3D) SRAM-CIM. However, CN-MOSFETs possess unique process variations with asymmetric spatial correlations which can significantly influence the performance and reliability of carbon-based SRAM-CIM. In this paper, new M3D-4N4P SRAM-CIM cells with CN-MOSFETs are proposed with optimized profiles for achieving ultra-high integration density while preserving robustness of data-access and computation. Furthermore, the variation-aware bit-wise data-mapping method is proposed for enhancing the performance of carbon-based SRAM-CIM by leveraging the spatial correlations of CN-MOSFETs. By minimizing the area skew of vertically-stacked layers, the areas of proposed M3D-4N4P SRAM-CIM cells are reduced by up to 50.32% compared to the previous 6N2P SRAM-CIM cells assuming carbon nanotube transistor technology.

Transformer-based IR methods have significantly improved the visual effects of the restored images. However, deploying complex IR models on edge devices is challenging due to massive parameters and intensive computations. Moreover, existing accelerators are typically customized for a single task, resulting in severe resource underutilization when executing multiple tasks. Therefore, this paper develops an algorithm-hardware co-design framework to accelerate a novel CNN-Transformer cooperative model for multiple IR tasks. Firstly, on the algorithm level, an Efficient Restoration Foundational Model (ERFM) is proposed to recover corrupted images from various degradations with low model complexity. Secondly, to guide adaptive corruption removal, a novel prompt learning scheme is introduced to fuse context-related degradation cues and boost high-quality reconstruction. Thirdly, on the hardware level, an integer approximation method is proposed to avoid expensive hardware overhead caused by complex nonlinear operations, such as layer normalization and softmax while maintaining comparable IR quality. Moreover, a head stationary dataflow and softmax fusion mechanism are designed to reduce data movement and enhance on-chip resource utilization. Finally, an overall hardware architecture is developed and implemented in TSMC 28 nm CMOS technology. Experimental results show that our ERFM achieves better visual perception than other baselines on seven challenging IR tasks without task-specific fine-tuning. Moreover, compared to other accelerators for vision Transformers, our design can achieve  $3.3\times $  and  $3.7\times $  improvements in throughput and energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>HAST: A Hardware-Efficient Spatio-Temporal Correlation Near-Sensor Noise Filter for Dynamic Vision Sensors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10812040</link><description>The Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS) is a bio-inspired image sensor which has many advantages such as high dynamic range, high bandwidth, high temporal resolution and low power consumption for Internet of Video Things and Edge Computing applications. However, spuriously generated Background Activity (BA) noise events can significantly degrade the quality of DVS output and cause unnecessary computations throughout the image processing chain, reducing its energy efficiency. Near-sensor filters can mitigate this problem by preventing the BA noise events from reaching downstream stages. In this paper, we propose a novel, hardware-efficient, spatio-temporal correlation filter (HAST) for near-sensor BA noise filtering. It uses compact two-dimensional binary arrays along with simple, arithmetic-free hash-based functions for storage and retrieval operations. This approach eliminates the need to use timestamps for determining the chronological order of events. HAST uses much lower memory and energy compared to other hardware-friendly filters (BAF/STCF) while matching their performance in simulations with standard datasets; for a sensor of resolution  $346\times 260$  pixels, it requires only 5&#8211;18% of their memory, and about 15% of their energy per event for correlation time  $\tau $  ranging from 1 to 50 ms. The memory and energy gains of the filter increase with sensor resolution. In FPGA implementation, HAST achieves about 29% higher throughput than BAF/STCF while utilizing only about 5% of their memory. The filter parameter values can be chosen by Design Space Exploration (DSE) for optimized performance-resource trade-offs based on application requirements.</description></item><item><title>A Graph-Based Accelerator of Retinex Model With Bit-Serial Computing for Image Enhancements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10857689</link><description>This work proposes the Poisson equation formulation of the Retinex model for image enhancements using a low-power graph hardware accelerator performing finite difference updates on a lattice graph processing element (PE) array. By encapsulating the underlying algorithm in a graph hardware structure, a highly localized dataflow that takes advantage of the physical placement of the PEs is enabled to minimize data movement and maximize data reuse. The on-chip dataflow that achieves data sharing, and reuse among neighboring PEs during massively parallel updates is generated in each PE driven by two external control signals.

At this stage, it is difficult for a single silicon-based chip to reach the density of the human brain, so it is important to improve the area efficiency of neuromorphic chips. We present a novel neuromorphic hardware that employs high area-efficiency chain RRAM synaptic array, and compact RRAM-based neurons.

However, this method consumes a significant amount of energy, and the power consumption increases under higher currents, limiting its applicability. To address this vital problem, a wide-range self-powered current measurement method is proposed in this work. The dual-core structure-based self-powered current measurement system integrates a magnetic field energy harvester (MFEH) and a current measurer (CM). In this system, the windings of the MFEH and the CM are connected in series, and the induced current of the MFEH is multiplexed. On one hand, it flows through the load for energy harvesting. Simultaneously, it flows into the CM, reducing the magnetic field within the air gap, and thereby broadening the range of current measurements. Besides, the equivalent circuit model of the dual-core structure is established to analyze the principles of current measurement and energy harvesting. Subsequently, a voltage regulation circuit based on an active rectifier is implemented, which can mitigate the saturation of the magnetic core over a wide current range. A laboratory prototype is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposal. The results show that the output voltage can be maintained at 3.3 V, ensuring stable voltage output. At 300 Arms, the maximum harvesting power reaches 1.83 W. Additionally, the upper limit of the measured current can reach 600 Arms, with a maximum error of 0.54%.</description></item><item><title>On the Effect of Memory Error in a Time-Interleaved Pipeline ADC With a Shared Residue Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10833849</link><description>Compared to traditional time-interleaved (TI) pipeline ADC, shared residue amplifier (RA) architecture is potentially more power efficient and requires simpler calibration. However, the shared RA architecture suffers from memory error, which severely degrades its linearity. Typically, a reset phase is needed at the RA&#8217;s input to avoid this memory error. The reset phase is particularly problematic for high-speed ADCs as it shortens the amplification time, leading to higher power consumption in the RA.

Based on the analysis, the saved power consumption from the XO buffer can be utilized to improve the PN of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), which compensates for the in-band PN degradation induced by the  $C_{\mathrm { S}}$  reduction. Based on this theme, we can reduce the total power consumption of the RS-PLL and the XO buffer without degrading the output root-mean-square (RMS) jitter by reducing  $C_{\mathrm { S}}$  if a VCO with a high figure-of-merit (FoM) and a low  $1/{f}^{3}$  PN corner frequency is available.

Prior state-of-the-art analog deobfuscation techniques, such as those using genetic algorithms (GAs) and the satisfiability modulo theory, require an Oracle (i.e., unlocked IC) to recover the correct key. However, in some scenarios, an attacker present in an untrusted foundry might not have access to the Oracle. We demonstrate an Oracle-less attack using Bayesian optimization (BO) to retrieve the key of locked analog designs. To thwart both Oracle-guided and Oracle-less attacks, we present an automated obfuscation circuit generation framework for securing analog ICs. By employing randomness in obfuscation circuit generation, the proposed analog key-based methodology safeguards the integrity and reliability of analog ICs. Experimental results and security analysis for several analog designs demonstrate the robustness of the proposed technique to optimization attacks based on a GA and BO. We further show that the probability of guessing the correct key through brute force attack for an obfuscated analog circuit is negligibly small  $(4.83\times 10^{-18})$ . The proposed obfuscation scheme incurs an area overhead of less than 1.3% and power overhead of less than 2.64% for a mixed-signal IC.</description></item><item><title>Sobol Sequence Optimization for Hardware-Efficient Vector Symbolic Architectures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10683781</link><description>Hyperdimensional computing (HDC) is an emerging computing paradigm with significant promise for efficient and robust learning. In HDC, objects are encoded with high-dimensional vector symbolic sequences called hypervectors. The quality of hypervectors, defined by their distribution and independence, directly impacts the performance of HDC systems. Despite a large body of work on the processing parts of HDC systems, little to no attention has been paid to data encoding and the quality of hypervectors. Most prior studies have generated hypervectors using inherent random functions, such as MATLAB&#8217;s or Python&#8217;s random function. This work introduces an optimization technique for generating hypervectors by employing quasi-random sequences. These sequences have recently demonstrated their effectiveness in achieving accurate and low-discrepancy data encoding in stochastic computing systems. The study outlines the optimization steps for utilizing Sobol sequences to produce high-quality hypervectors in HDC systems. An optimization algorithm is proposed to select the most suitable Sobol sequences via indexes for generating minimally correlated hypervectors, particularly in applications related to symbol-oriented architectures. The performance of the proposed technique is evaluated in comparison to two traditional approaches of generating hypervectors based on linear-feedback shift registers and MATLAB random functions. The evaluation is conducted for three applications: 1) language; 2) headline; and 3) medical image classification. Our experimental results demonstrate accuracy improvements of up to 10.79%, depending on the vector size. Additionally, the proposed encoding hardware exhibits reduced energy consumption and a superior area-delay product.</description></item><item><title>Algorithmically Enhanced Design of Spintronic-Based Tunable True Random Number Generator for Dependable Stochastic Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10640136</link><description>This article proposes a tunable true random number generator (TTRNG) based on stochastic magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) switching in the subcritical current regime. The proposed design consists of three parts. The first part is a write/read circuit featuring a static write circuit and an energy-efficient circuit optimized for read operations. The second finds the probability generation array (PGA) similar to the longest common subsequence (LCS) problem. However, the algorithms presented so far for the LCS have not been responsive to finding the Desired-PGA as it must look for the common subsequence among one million sequences, each sequence being 259 long. Hence, the convergence of those algorithms is impossible in this problem. Accordingly, we propose an algorithm to find a common subsequence of length 24, each defining a logic function. We also propose a controller to generate arbitrary probabilities with a zero steady-state error. These parts, especially PGA, make the design highly robust to the process variations. Notably, the proposed design passes the National Institute of Standards and Technology test. The proposed design also reduces energy dissipation compared to previous designs. Also, as it does not require precise sizing, the FinFET technology is appropriately used to design the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Buffer and Splitter Insertion for Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametron Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10684033</link><description>The extremely low-bit energy characteristic of the adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) circuit makes it a promising candidate for highly energy-efficient computing systems. However, in contrast with conventional circuit design, general logic synthesis tools can not make sure that the circuit functionality of generated AQFP circuits is correct. AQFP circuits require buffer and splitter insertion for dataflow synchronization at all clock phases of the circuit and multifan-out driving. Notably, buffers and splitters inserted take up much area and delay in AQFP circuits, also causing a significant increase in energy dissipation. To address this problem, this article analyses in detail why buffer and splitter insertion is necessary for AQFP circuits and proposes a global optimization framework for this purpose. This framework consists of three parts: 1) logic level assignment; 2) splitter tree generation; and 3) buffer insertion. An integer linear programming algorithm is proposed for the logic level assignment to estimate the globally optimal number of inserted buffers and splitters. Subsequently, a dynamic programming-based multiway search tree generation algorithm is proposed to construct an optimal splitter tree for each net of the input circuit. Moreover, three optimization strategies are proposed to further enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our framework. Experimental results on ISCAS&#8217;85 and EPFL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework compared with the state-of-the-art, particularly with significant advantages on large circuits.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Data Reuse for Loop Mapping on CGRAs With Joint Affine and Nonaffine Transformations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659174</link><description>Coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) can provide high energy efficiency while maintaining flexibility, which is promising to keep pace with the power requirements and the frequent updates of applicants. With flexible register chains, modern CGRAs enable data reuse within the processing element array (PEA) to reduce on-chip memory accesses and improve pipelining performance. However, existing works pay little attention to comprehensive loop transformations, such as affine and nonaffine transformation, to obtain a data reuse-friendly loop structure. Therefore, this article proposes a data-reuse-friendly loop mapping approach using joint affine and nonaffine transformations. With affine transformations, the distance of loop dependencies could be reduced and then handled by in-PEA routes. With nonaffine transformations (i.e., loop unrolling), small loop kernels could be unrolled and expose more memory accesses for data reuse. To efficiently solve the loop transformation problem, we first establish a reduced polyhedral formulation and then propose a divide-and-conquer-based solution to find optimized transformations with moderate compilation time. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can achieve a speedup up to  $1.74\times $  compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Automatic Design of IGBT Structural Parameters Using Differential Evolution and Machine Learning Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10693555</link><description>Insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) are the key component in power electronics, and the intricate relationship between their performance and structural parameters poses a formidable challenge in the design process. This article proposes an automatic optimal design method for IGBT structural parameters to leverage the pretrained machine learning (ML) model to efficiently predict the initial IGBT device&#8217;s performance, followed by utilizing the differential evolution (DE) algorithm to automatically adjust structural parameters based on the disparity between predicted and expected device performance until the expected performance is achieved. The method is validated in the design of punch-through IGBTs (PT-IGBTs) and trench gate field-stop IGBTs (FS-IGBTs), and the performance of technology computer-aided design (TCAD) simulation of the designed device is similar to the target performance. In particular, the simulation results of the designed FS-IGBT are highly fitted to the datasheet of the commercial device, which verifies the generalizability and effectiveness of the method. In addition, comparative analyses with various algorithms show DE provides the fastest optimization and extraordinary robustness under the exact specifications. Crucially, the proposed design scheme aligns with semiconductor physics. The method simplifies IGBT design without the need for manual tuning and TCAD tool simulation.</description></item><item><title>Graceful Register Clustering and Rebanking for Power and Timing Balancing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10643595</link><description>As dynamic power has become the bottleneck to achieving low power, clock power reduction is crucial in modern IC design. Register clustering can effectively save clock power because of significantly reducing the number of clock sinks and register pin capacitance, clock routed wirelength, and the number of clock buffers. In this article, we propose effective mean shift to naturally form clusters according to register distribution without placement disruption. Effective mean shift fulfills the requirements to be a good register clustering algorithm because it needs no prespecified number of clusters, is insensitive to initializations, is robust to outliers, is tolerant of various register distributions, is efficient and scalable, and balances clock power reduction against timing degradation. Furthermore, we devise a rebanking mechanism to legalize the clustering result according to the adopted multibit register library. Experimental results show that our approach achieves superior power and timing balancing.</description></item><item><title>Design and Utilization of Multiskewed Multibit Flip-Flop Cells for Timing Optimization: Design and Technology Co-Optimization Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10677402</link><description>Utilizing multibit flip-flops (MBFFs) in circuit implementation offers a considerable saving on the dynamic power dissipated at the clock networks. However, indiscreetly allocating MBFFs by grouping single-bit flip-flops at the logic synthesis or placement stage in order to greedily save dynamic power severely hinders a full applicability of useful clock skew scheduling to the individual flip-flops in MBFFs, failing in effectively optimizing circuit timing. This is because the two internal clock inverters, consequently, the clock skew value, in an MBFF are shared by all of the flip-flops in the MBFF. This work overcomes this inherent limitation of inflexibility in MBFFs for useful clock skew scheduling by proposing a comprehensive design and technology co-optimization (DTCO) framework. To this end, we devise a new layout of MBFF cells called multiskewed MBFF layout, in which different clock skew values can be set to the individual internal flip-flops at the cost of additional internal clock inverters. With the multiskewed MBFFs, we propose a three-step DTCO flow: 1) DTCO-based flip-flop clustering at the logic stage, which clusters flip-flops considering multiskewed MBFFs; 2) DTCO based on in-place MBFF debanking technique at the preroute stage to facilitate the full applicability of useful skew scheduling at the subsequent stages; and 3) DTCO utilizing MBFF cell layout diversification at the post-route stage, by which useful clock skew scheduling can effectively resolve timing violations. Through experiments with OpenCores benchmark circuits, it is shown that our proposed DTCO flow of reinforcing the effectiveness of useful clock skew scheduling on circuits with MBFF instances is able to reduce the worst and total negative slacks by 36.73% and 50.76%, respectively, while decreasing the clock and total power consumption by 43.46% and 22.70% over that produced by the conventional flow using a state-of-the-art commercial tool.</description></item><item><title>LithoHoD: A Litho Simulator-Powered Framework for IC Layout Hotspot Detection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10683791</link><description>Recent advances in VLSI fabrication technology have led to die shrinkage and increased layout density, creating an urgent demand for advanced hotspot detection techniques. However, by taking an object detection network as the backbone, recent learning-based hotspot detectors learn to recognize only the problematic layout patterns in the training data. This fact makes these hotspot detectors difficult to generalize to real-world scenarios. We propose a novel lithography simulator-powered hotspot detection framework to overcome this difficulty. Our framework integrates a lithography simulator with an object detection backbone, merging the extracted latent features from both the simulator and the object detector via well-designed cross-attention blocks. Consequently, the proposed framework can be used to detect potential hotspot regions based on 1) the variation of possible circuit shape deformation estimated by the lithography simulator and 2) the problematic layout patterns already known. To this end, we utilize RetinaNet with a feature pyramid network as the object detection backbone and leverage LithoNet as the lithography simulator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed simulator-guided hotspot detection framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods on real-world data.</description></item><item><title>Prior-Boosted GRL: Microarchitecture Design Space Exploration via Graph Representation Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10673996</link><description>The design space exploration (DSE) of contemporary microprocessors faces a significant challenge of high-computational cost. In this context, we introduce Prior-boosted graph representation learning (GRL), a novel framework for the DSE of the microarchitectures the microprocessors underpinned by graph embeddings. Using GRL, Prior-boosted GRL constructs a compact and continuous vector space for design representation. This framework is further boosted by an efficient sampling algorithm informed by prior knowledge, which is instrumental in generating a superior set of initial designs to accelerate the exploration process. A well-designed ensemble surrogate model is combined with the multiobjective Bayesian optimization to explore the design space holistically within this graph-embedding domain. Rigorous experimental evaluations conducted on the RISC-V Berkeley-Out-of-Order Machine (BOOM) platform demonstrate that Prior-boosted GRL substantially surpasses preceding methods, achieving a 107.79% enhancement in Pareto front quality compared to the state-of-the-art DSE algorithm. It also outstrips manual designs on performance, power, and area metrics. As of this writing, Prior-boosted GRL holds the first place in the ICCAD 2022 CAD Contest evaluation platform.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Low-Power BIST for Automotive SoC With Periodic Pattern Type Selection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10677544</link><description>In the realm of automotive System-on-Chip (SoC), scan-based logic built-in self-test (LBIST) is commonly utilized for in-system testing, primarily for its cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, this approach encounters challenges, particularly in attaining high-test coverage within constrained test times. The challenge intensifies when implementing low-power patterns, as it further complicates the achievement of adequate test coverage. To overcome these hurdles, this article introduces a novel testing methodology that enhances test coverage using low-toggled patterns. This method consists of two primary phases. Initially, it involves grouping and pairing scan cells (SCs), ensuring adjacent placement of paired cells. The following phase involves the generation of low-toggled patterns, tailored to the specific arrangement of SCs. To optimally detect as many previously undetected faults as possible, this method applies the low-power pattern selectively to particular scan groups. Furthermore, the scan group subjected to low-power patterns alternates after a certain number of patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of this proposed method in both fault detection and power reduction, in comparison to earlier methods.</description></item><item><title>Fast Machine-Learning-Driven Supply Noise-Aware Macromodeling for High-Speed Nonlinear Drivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10666877</link><description>Emerging domains, such as artificial intelligence, 5G mobile, and automotive, are increasingly reliant on high-speed circuits for efficient processing, in which achieving high operating frequencies and data rates is crucial to enable productive data exchange and rapid responses. High-speed data as well as low noise margin in the high-speed serial links call for efficient models of drivers. In this article, we propose a fast machine-learning-driven macromodel for high-speed drivers, which can efficiently capture the nonlinear characteristics of drivers considering dynamic supply noise with low model complexity. A decoupling-superposition strategy is employed to effectively calculate the impact of power supply noise. Additionally, we introduce a piecewise-segmented method for macromodel solving to further enhance the speed of model utilization. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to HSPICE, the proposed macromodel achieves up to  $50\times $ &#8211; $1200\times $  speedup while maintaining sufficient accuracy, even for signals with GHz data rate.</description></item></channel></rss>
