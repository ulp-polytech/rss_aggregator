In dc&#8211;dc converters, electrolytic capacitors (ECs) are often used as smoothening filters, despite their vulnerability and unreliable operation. Also, the multipeak PV characteristic caused by PSCs is one of the prime challenges in efficient solar PV integration. To avoid these issues, an isolated EC-less dual half-active bridge resonant converter (DHABRC) is proposed and integrated with solar panels using a PSO-based MPPT algorithm for efficient power transfer under PSCs. The DHABRC utilizes two half-active bridges to reduce the switch count and replaces the ECs with film capacitors (FCs). So the converter becomes simple, easy to control, reliable, and economical. For soft-switching and steady-state analysis of the DHABRC, fundamental approximation analysis is used. For the validation of the proof of concept, a 500-W scaled-down laboratory prototype is developed and tested under steady-state and PSCs using shading patterns (SPs) of different voltage and power ratings. Also, the feasibility of using FCs is proved using different tests like startup transient, load dynamics, and changes in SPs.</description></item><item><title>Unified One-Cycle Control for Fully Digitalized ZVS Four-Switch Buck&#8211;Boost Converter During Bidirectional Power Flow Transition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538435</link><description>A unified one-cycle control is presented to achieve bidirectional power flow operation for a four-switch buck&#8211;boost converter employing fully digitalized control. There is no need for analog comparators or digital-to-analog converters. Based on the new definition of operating modes, modulation can be unified in both the directional operations. One-cycle bidirectional power transition with fully zero-voltage switching (ZVS) can be achieved under various voltage conversion gains. A modified control curve of inductor current is proposed to eliminate the power oscillation during operation, and ZVS can be ensured during the transition. A 450-W prototype using the proposed fully digital control under bidirectional power flow operation is verified successfully.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Matrix Based Network for Multi-Module Parallel Megahertz Inverter System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10540377</link><description>As key subsystem of the semiconductor etching system, the multimodule megahertz inverter needs to modulate power through load differences efficiently and accurately, however, losses of resonant inverter modules are reduced only within narrow load range. The existing inverters often fail to mathematically resolve the conflict between power range and efficiency range. This article proposes a method that balances efficiencies and power range for multimodule parallel systems. The essence lies in mathematically designing load trajectories for each module that covers wide power range within efficiency boundaries through a three-matrix passive network. A two-inverters paralleled system is designed with load-sensitive class D inverter modules as an example. Through passive network, the ideal load trajectory is guaranteed. Two 40&#8201;V input, 13.56&#8201;MHz prototypes are built and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method offers various way of designing network, and both networks are able to control the effective impedance trajectory of modules within the desired range. Therefore, the inverter operates with efficiencies above 60% with power varying from 10&#8201;W to 100&#8201;W.</description></item><item><title>A Systematic Method for Studying the Use of DC/DC Converters With Three Discontinuous Conduction Modes as Automatic PFCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10540317</link><description>This article describes a general method for studying the behavior of converters with three discontinuous conduction modes as automatic power factor correctors (PFCs). Some converters with a single discontinuous conduction mode (such as Buck-Boost, Flyback, SEPIC, &#262;uk, and Zeta converters) can behave as automatic PFCs when operating in that discontinuous conduction mode, with a nearly constant duty cycle during each cycle of the line voltage. There are also dc/dc converters that, due to multiple diodes and inductors, can operate in different discontinuous conduction modes. A systematic method for studying these three discontinuous conduction modes was recently presented. This article extends that method to using the aforementioned dc/dc converters as part of an ac/dc converter with low harmonic injection in the line, identifying when the converters behave as &#8220;ideal automatic resistor emulators&#8221; (i.e., configuring ideal automatic PFCs) and when they behave as &#8220;quasi-ideal automatic resistor emulators&#8221; (i.e., as quasi-ideal automatic PFCs). As an example, the article examines a SEPIC converter used as a resistor emulator. In this case, three discontinuous conduction modes are possible, if the inductance of the input inductor is low enough to allow the input bridge rectifier diodes to stop conducting when the transistor is off. The study allows us to determine of the line current waveform when the converter operates in any of the possible discontinuous conduction modes. The results show that quasi-ideal automatic PFC behavior can be achieved in discontinuous conduction modes with low inductance values. Moreover, the results for the SEPIC can be easily extended to the &#262;uk converter operating in the same manner. Finally, the theoretical predictions for the line current from the proposed study were verified through simulation using PSIM (in the case of both the SEPIC and &#262;uk topologies), and through experimentation (in the case of SEPIC).</description></item><item><title>A 1500-A/48-V-to-1-V Switching Bus Converter for Next-Generation Ultra-High-Power Processors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559753</link><description>This article proposes an ultra-high-current 48-V-to-1-V hybrid switched-capacitor (SC) voltage regulator, named the switching bus converter, with a single-stage vertical power delivery architecture for next-generation ultra-high-power processors (e.g., graphics processing units, central processing units, application-specific integrated circuits, etc.). The proposed topology consists of two 2-to-1 SC front-ends and four 10-branch series-capacitor-buck modules, merged through four switching buses. Compared to the existing dc-bus-based architecture, the proposed switching-bus-based architecture eliminates the need for dc bus capacitors, reduces the switch count, and guarantees complete soft-charging operation. Through a topological comparison, this article reveals that the proposed topology achieves the lowest normalized switch stress and the smallest normalized passive component volume among existing 48-V-to-1-V hybrid SC demonstrations, showing great potential for both higher efficiency and higher power density than prior hybrid SC solutions. A hardware prototype was designed and built with custom four-phase coupled inductors and gate drive daughterboards to validate the functionality and performance of the proposed switching bus converter. It was tested up to 1500-A output current and achieved 92.7% peak system efficiency, 85.7% full-load system efficiency (including gate drive loss), and 759 W/in$^{3}$ power density (by box volume), pushing the performance limit of the state-of-the-art 48-V-to-1-V solutions toward higher efficiency and higher power density.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Comparison of Integrated Planar Transformers for 22-kW On-Board Chargers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10551535</link><description>The surge in electric vehicle technology has brought attention to the manufacturing and design of 22-kW on-board chargers using printed circuit boards (PCBs), owing to their manufacturability and compact nature. However, designing transformers for these applications is challenging due to the demands of higher power and a smaller profile. The challenges include achieving optimal current distribution in parallel windings and easier transformer structure with better thermal performance. In addition, the integration of resonant inductance is crucial for regulatory functions and higher power densities. The integration with parallel windings also impacts the overall transformer performance, which needs to be analyzed. This article presents a detailed analysis and design approach for a 22-kW PCB-based transformer with good current sharing, controllable leakage inductance, and a simplified core structure. The study also includes an in-depth analysis of the transformer's flux distribution to minimize core loss. A 22-kW CLLC resonant converter is developed to validate the proposed transformer using PCB-packaged devices. With its modified flux distribution and good current sharing, the integrated transformer enables the converter to achieve a power density of 11.6 kW/L and a peak efficiency of 98.5%.</description></item><item><title>Dual Discontinuous PWM-Based Power Distribution Control of Multisource Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10535742</link><description>The multisource inverter (MSI) is a promising topology for hybrid electric vehicles due to its advanced merits of single-stage power conversion from each source to the motor without dc&#8211;dc converters. However, it is challenging to design a modulation scheme for the MSI since it not only determines the output voltage on the ac side, but also the power distribution between the sources on the dc side. Furthermore, the computation burden for the MSI is heavy due to its unsymmetrical distributed voltage vectors. Given this, this article proposes a dual discontinuous pulsewidth modulation (D$^{2}$PWM) scheme to simultaneously realize power distribution and motor drive control for the MSI. In the proposed D$^{2}$PWM, the MSI is decomposed into two independent subinverters, and modulation schemes of each subinverter can be implemented in symmetric space-vector diagrams, which avoids heavy computational burden under the unsymmetrical voltage vector diagram. Besides, the total switching times of 3 in the proposed D$^{2}$PWM are realized by assigning the desired voltage vector for one of the subinverters aligned with the basic voltage vectors, which reduces the switching losses in this decomposed model and improves the current quality of the MSI. Comparative experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed D$^{2}$PWM.</description></item><item><title>Boost-Based Active Power Decoupling Converter With Voltage Complementary for Electrolytic Capacitor-Less PMSM Drive System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10552370</link><description>A new boost-based active power decoupling circuit (APDC) with voltage complementary is proposed for electrolytic capacitor-less (ECL) permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) drive systems. To increase the dc-link voltage level of the drive system, the decoupling capacitor of the APDC and the output capacitor of a boost converter are connected in series. Then, the decoupling capacitor and the boost output capacitor are complementarily controlled by the APDC to suppress the dc-link voltage ripple effectively. The capacitance and operation voltage of the two capacitors are diverse, improving the drive system's robustness to capacitance. By using this APDC, the speed range of ECL drive systems can be increased and good performance of PMSMs under stable and dynamic operation conditions can be implemented due to small dc-link voltage ripple. Finally, the experiments with the ECL drive system are accomplished to verify the feasibility.</description></item><item><title>Fast Efficiency Optimization Control Based on Orthogonal Current Phasor Model for Linear Oscillatory Motor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10554285</link><description>As the key power part of the linear compressor, the linear oscillatory motor (LOM) has been paid more attention by both academia and industry recently for its compact size, high efficiency, low vibration, etc. In practice, the efficiency of LOM is significantly impacted by the changes in load parameters, of which the best working point can be tracked by the resonant frequency tracking control (RFTC). However, the traditional RFTC with the idea of stroke-current phase suffers some problems, such as slow tracking speed, low accuracy, fluctuate amplitude of piston, and so on. In this article, a novel fast efficiency optimization control algorithm based on the orthogonal current phasor model is proposed for LOM. This new model can achieve the decoupling of current components that act on piston stroke and system efficiency, respectively. Moreover, the driving frequency can be adjusted by current decoupling control with a designed phase-locked loop. Based on the aforementioned, the decoupling control of the LOM drive system can be achieved, which can simultaneously improve the system response speed and the output efficiency. Comprehensive simulation and experimental results have fully demonstrated the advantages of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Minimal Power Loss Control for Doubly Salient Electromagnetic Machine Based on Optimal Currents Distribution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566038</link><description>The traditional doubly salient electromagnetic machine (DSEM) system sets the field current to the rated value regardless of speed or load torque conditions, bringing in large power losses, especially under less rated power conditions. To overcome this shortcoming, this article proposes a minimal power loss control for DSEM based on optimal current distribution. First, based on the power loss calculation model, the quantified relationships between the power loss and field current are obtained under certain speed and load torque conditions. Then, to minimize the power loss, a distribution strategy of field current and armature current is put forward, the command value of field current is achieved according to system operating conditions, and an easy-implemented torque observer with high accuracy is designed for identifying the load torque, in which the magnetic saturation is taken into consideration. Further, to obtain the optimal field current value more easily rather than looking up the large memory-consumed 3-D table or directly solving the sixth-order equation, the current distribution strategies based on an ergodic algorithm and a back propagation (BP) neural network algorithm are proposed, which achieve online calculation of the optimal current and their performances are comparatively explored. With the decreased field current, less power loss as well as smaller cogging torque ripples are desired to be achieved. The simulation and experiments verify the correctness and feasibility of the proposed strategies under multiple operating conditions.</description></item><item><title>Design Optimization of Dual Active Bridge Converter for Supercapacitor Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10530382</link><description>Supercapacitor (SC) is an energy storage suitable for meeting short-term requirements in power conversion systems. However, the low and variable terminal voltage of SC-based energy storage poses challenges to the design of its power electronic interface (PEI) to achieve a high round-trip efficiency and a rapid response of the energy storage system. The PEI design methodologies existing in the literature do not clearly tackle the mitigation of switching and conduction losses over the entire operating range of the SC. This article proposes a design strategy for an SC-interface dual active bridge (DAB) converter. The terminal characteristics of the SC are incorporated into an analytical design formulation aiming to maximize the DAB efficiency over the SC discharging cycle. The resulting optimization problem, addressing both conduction and switching losses, is solved numerically to obtain the optimal circuit parameters. The realization of the design objectives and the obtained efficiency is validated in circuit simulation and experiments on a 250 W laboratory prototype with a 125 V dc bus and a nominal SC voltage of 37.5 V, illustrating the improvement achieved over the conventional design approach.</description></item><item><title>Suppression of AC Coupling Effects on HVdc Transmission System Based on MMC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538426</link><description>As the number of dc transmission systems increases, more dc lines are constructed in close proximity to existing ac transmission lines.

By applying the proposed controller, the MMC-HVdc system can operate without any interference from the ac coupling effect. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through both full-scale simulation and scaled experimental studies.</description></item><item><title>Double Normalization Fault Diagnosis Method for Open-Circuit Faults of PMSM Drives</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538057</link><description>In this article, a double normalization fault diagnosis (DNFD) method is proposed to cope with open-circuit faults of permanent magnet synchronous motor drives. The proposed DNFD method consists of a current normalizer, a time-domain fault variable determinator, a time-domain to angle-domain converter, an angle normalizer, and a fault identification encoder. The affections of the variable torque can be eliminated by the current normalizer, whereas the affections of the variable speed can be eliminated by the angle normalizer, which is the main contribution of this article. To reduce the affections of the following factors, i.e., the calculation error of the time-domain to angle-domain converter, the measurement noises of current sensors, the performance of the analog-to-digital converter, the sampling frequency, and the electromagnetic interference of the system, the hysteresis comparator is employed, in which two fault thresholds are required. Compared with the conventional single normalization fault diagnosis method, the DNFD method has better robustness. The effectiveness of the proposed DNFD method is verified by the experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Parameter Design for Suppressing Current Distortion Caused by DC Bias in Dual-Active-Bridge Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10547319</link><description>The dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter has been widely used, but the current distortion caused by dc bias has not been well addressed due to the high/medium switching frequency. A conventional DAB converter utilizes an auxiliary inductor to enhance efficiency in normal operation, with the auxiliary inductor typically connected to the primary side of the DAB transformer. However, replacing the original auxiliary inductor with distributed auxiliary inductors, one connected to the primary side and the other connected to the secondary side, can help alleviate current distortion when the magnetic core is saturated without influence on the DAB converter during normal operation. In this article, a numerical calculation method is introduced to simultaneously calculate both the induced voltage and the excitation current of the DAB converter under dc bias. Based on the calculation results, a data fitting-based formula for optimizing the inductance distribution is proposed. The rationale behind the proposed formula is elucidated using mathematical methods. The accuracy of the numerical calculation process is verified by simulation results. The effectiveness of the proposed formula is validated through numerical, simulation, and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Challenges and Implementation of Online In Situ RDSON Measurement in a Three-Phase Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10551638</link><description>This article addresses the critical issue of real-time monitoring of on-state resistance (RDSON) of all power semiconductor devices within a three-phase inverter.

This article presents an on-chip condition monitoring (CM) approach addressing these challenges by seamlessly integrating device aging prognosis and dielectric failure detection into a unified circuit platform. Specifically, leveraging the device turn-on transient time (ton) as a reliable aging precursor, we propose a closed-loop ton sensing scheme with self-regulated sampling to enhance precursor readout accuracy while mitigating sensing delays. Furthermore, we improve CM accuracy through junction temperature (TJ) calibration, effectively eliminating temperature-induced effects on precursor measurements. Concurrently, we develop a gate leakage current (IGSS) based sensing scheme for dielectric failure detection, sharing the same circuitry of TJ calibration. Leveraging a proposed reconfigurable tri-mode gate driver, this CM approach minimizes impact on normal system operation. A power IC prototype was implemented on a 180-nm BCD process. Demonstrated on a GaN half-bridge power converter, the proposed CM exhibits the precise detection of both device aging and dielectric failure.</description></item><item><title>The Effect of Bearing Impedance on Online Condition Monitoring for Rotor Winding Insulation of Doubly-Fed Induction Generator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10561613</link><description>Doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) play a vital role in wind power generation, yet their rotor winding insulation is susceptible to failure due to high dv/dt voltage from rotor-side converters and mechanical stress under varying operating conditions. While existing methods primarily focus on fault diagnosis, capable of detecting short-circuit faults but lacking in prognostic capabilities, this article delves into the development of an online condition monitoring method based on common-mode leakage current measurement. The study begins with an introduction to the model and measurement technique for winding insulation, followed by an analysis of capacitive coupling, which gives a path for high-frequency leakage current in DFIG systems. Furthermore, the article examines the impact of bearing impedance on rotor-side monitoring outcomes through theoretical analysis and simulation. Finally, the proposed method is validated through online experimentation, demonstrating its efficacy in providing real-time condition monitoring not only for rotor winding insulation but also for the state of shaft grounding devices in wind power generation systems.</description></item><item><title>Rotating Restart Method for TPFS Inverter-Fed Sensorless PMSM Drive System Based on Dual Effective Voltage Vectors Injection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10564192</link><description>This article proposes a solution to the challenge of achieving a reliable restart in sensorless permanent magnet synchronous motors transitioning from a three-phase six-switch inverter to a three-phase four-switch (TPFS) inverter due to faults. The proposed rotating restart method employs the injection of dual effective voltage vectors to synthesize the equivalent zero-voltage vector, under unbalanced capacitor voltage conditions in the TPFS inverter. This synthesis is achieved by incorporating the capacitor voltage offset into the duration calculation of the dual effective voltage vectors. Once the main power supply is restored, the dual effective voltage vectors are injected into the motor windings through the TPFS inverter, producing the short-circuit current influenced by the back electromotive force. The method utilizes the accumulated short-circuit current values to estimate the initial rotor position and speed, enabling a smooth and efficient rotating restart. This innovative method enhances the accuracy of rotor position and speed detection, reduces impulse current, and ensures the fault-tolerant operation of the system. The theoretical analysis is validated through experimental results, demonstrating the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Modeling Method for the Real-Time Simulation of Bridge-Based High-Switching-Frequency Power Electronic Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10533852</link><description>The $R_{\text{on}}/R_{\text{off}}$ model provides high accuracy in the real-time simulation of high-switching-frequency power electronic converters. However, the iterative operations limit the application of the $R_{\text{on}}/R_{\text{off}}$ model in high-switching-frequency domains. This article presents a novel noniterative method for determining the switch statuses of half-bridge arms. By predicting the state variables and correcting the switch status combinations in the natural commutation process with the status switching principle, the accurate switch status can be obtained. Besides, this method adopts the backward Euler method to ensure the system stability and realizes the decoupling among the half-bridge arms, which greatly reduces the modeling complexity and calculation amount when judging the switch status. Finally, an ac&#8211;dc&#8211;ac topology with 100-kHz switching frequency and an $LLC$ resonant converter with 250-kHz switching frequency are implemented on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). The parallel solving architecture enables simulation time step as low as 25 ns. The results derived from the real-time simulation and hardware experiment corroborate low FPGA resource consumption and high precision of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Coordination Control for Enhancing Photovoltaic Power Imbalance Tolerant Capability of MMC-Based Photovoltaic System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538210</link><description>The internal reactive power compensation strategy (IRPCS) and harmonic compensation strategy (HCS) can be used in modular multilevel converter&#8211;based photovoltaic systems (MMC-PVSs) for PV power imbalance, but have requirements of extending tolerant capability and degrading internal reactive power at severe imbalance, and have the problem of overmodulation occurring on normal submodules (SMs). This article first merges IRPCS and HCS (IRPCS-HCS) to, to some extent, extend the tolerant capability and reduce the internal reactive power. Subsequently, a dual loop control and a reactive power distribution method are proposed for further optimization. The outer loop eliminates overmodulation on normal SMs via regulating the modulation index upper boundary to realize normal SM full compensation of injected harmonics of overmodulation SMs. To further expand the tolerant capability with the least amount of internal reactive power, the inner loop makes the SM maximum modulation index closely track the upper boundary to prevent overcompensation of internal reactive power, and the reactive power distribution method optimally allocates the reactive power to SMs. Finally, simulation and experimental results are illustrated to verify the feasibility of the proposed control.</description></item><item><title>Mechanism Analysis and Elimination of Multiple Pulse Phenomenon of Active Rectifier in Wireless Power Transfer Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10533858</link><description>Active rectifier is widely used in wireless power transfer systems. On/off delay-compensation technique is commonly used to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of rectifier. However, it also introduces multiple pulse (MP) problem, which could greatly reduce the efficiency and significantly impacts the reliability of system. In this work, the mechanism of MP is comprehensively analyzed and two elimination methods are indicated and compared. The critical circuit parameter is analyzed. To implement the method, an active rectifier with dual-edge D-latch (DEDL) is proposed. The advantage of the DEDL is that the output of comparator can be latched up to achieve an adjustable delay time at both rising and falling edges. As the result, the MP at the output of the comparator will not affect the gate of the power metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor. The rectifier is fabricated with a standard 0.18 &#956;m complementary metal oxide semiconductor process. The core area of chip is 0.268 mm2. The maximum output power of rectifier is 40 mW. The PCE is higher than 90% when Vac = 2 V and 51 &#937;&lt;300 &#937;. The peak PCE is 93.3% when Vac = 2 V and RL = 100 &#937;. Measurement results show the effectiveness of the proposed elimination method, and also prove that the theoretical analysis of MP is correct.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Power Transfer Efficiency in Biomedical Implants: A Comparative Analysis of SS and SP Inductive Link Topologies</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10533450</link><description>Inductive link intended to deliver energy to implantable devices is recently becoming a popular method. To improve link efficiency, the compensated capacitors are adopted to resonate at the same frequency with the power transfer frequency on both sides. However, there is limited research on link efficiency and output power concerning quality factors, the selection between serial&#8211;parallel (SP) and serial&#8211;serial (SS) topologies, as well as coil design. This study delves into the efficiency of SP and SS topologies using rigorous mathematical derivations with reflected impedance models in terms of quality factors. It introduces a selection factor to help choose topology based on link efficiency. Results show that SS is better when the load quality factor ($Q_{L}$) is lower than the selection factor, and vice versa. The study also examines the performance limits of both topologies concerning frequency, inductance, and load impedance. It proposes a specific $Q_{L}$ for maximum efficiency and a coil design procedure considering specific absorption rate limitations. By leveraging simulations and the design procedure, the study manufactures a pair of flexible coils for biomedical use. The designed link achieves a 62.99% efficiency under a 500 $\Omega$ load, with an overall efficiency of 46.96% including a passive rectifier.</description></item><item><title>Selected-Interharmonic-Injected Pulse Density Modulation for One-to-Many WPT Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10533863</link><description>Multifrequency one-to-many wireless power transfer (O2M-WPT) is advantageous for charging various medium- and small-power loads, offering cost-effectiveness, simplicity, and minimal cross-coupling effects. However, inevitable hard switching caused by the multifrequency modulation method may lead to significant switching losses. To reduce the switching losses, a novel selected-interharmonic-injected pulse density modulation (SI2PDM) method for simultaneous O2M-WPT systems is proposed in this article. SI2PDM actively injects the selected interharmonics into the primary coil for multifrequency modulation. Besides, SI2PDM artfully regulates the interharmonic by choosing the optimal sequence from the sequences with the same pulse density to achieve independent power allocation. Most importantly, the switching frequency is reduced below the maximum operating frequency, which is beneficial for reducing switching losses and improving efficiency. Comparative experimental results between SI2PDM and an existing method reveal a remarkable 18.58% to 82.83% reduction in inverter power losses and a substantial 1.23% to 20.27% improvement in dc-to-load efficiency. These results affirm the feasibility and effectiveness of SI2PDM in achieving independent power allocation and enhancing efficiency in simultaneous O2M-WPT systems.</description></item><item><title>A Family of Self-Adaptive Interoperable Receivers Based on Multiple Decoupled Receiving Poles for Electric Vehicle Wireless Charging Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538429</link><description>In electric vehicle wireless power transfer (EVWPT) systems, unipolar (UP), bipolar, and multipolar coils produced by different manufacturers are not well compatible with each other, resulting in the interoperability issues. In order to solve this contradiction, a family of self-adaptive interoperable receivers based on multiple decoupled receiving poles is proposed. Based on the two decoupled poles as the receiving coil, the proposed self-adaptive two-pole interoperable receiver can tolerate both the UP transmitting coil and the bipolar (BP) transmitting coil along one direction. On this basis, it is extended to a self-adaptive four-pole interoperable receiver. The four poles are coplanar and decoupled by using four externally decoupling windings. This self-adaptive four-pole receiver can tolerate the UP transmitting coil, the BP transmitting coil along two directions, and the quadrupole (QP) transmitting coil by forming effective equivalent mutual inductances with them, thus achieving interoperability. Moreover, misalignment tolerance is also realized. The experimental results of the two-pole and four-pole proposals show that efficient power transmission can be achieved with various transmitting coils including the UP, BP, and QP transmitting coils, realizing interoperability and misalignment tolerance.</description></item><item><title>Three-Phase Electrolytic-Capacitor-Less LCC-S WPT System With Wide Operation Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10538428</link><description>In order to improve the integration and life time of ac voltage input wireless power transfer (WPT) system, a topology based on electrolytic-capacitor-less matrix converter with inductor-capacitor-capacitor-series (LCC-S) resonant network is proposed.

To mitigate reactive power and achieve higher efficiency, the proposed OMC method incorporates dual-side hybrid modulation and primary-side switch-controlled-capacitor (SCC) tuning into the triple-phase-shift (TPS) control. First, the impact of hybrid modulation and SCC tuning on the system characteristics is investigated. The inverter and rectifier zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) conditions are then analyzed to achieve dual-side ZVS with minimal reactive power. Furthermore, a multivariable optimization problem is established based on the power loss analysis. The solution to this problem provides optimal control variables that minimize the overall system loss. Through collaborative modulation and control of the inverter, rectifier, and SCC, the proposed method reduces the rms values of the currents and lowers the turn-off currents for the converters. As a result, this approach improves efficiency in both light- and heavy-load conditions, enabling wide output regulation and full-range efficiency optimization simultaneously. Finally, the proposed method is benchmarked with the existing TPS method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves higher dc-to-dc efficiency in the power range of 0.2&#8211;2.2 kW, with a maximum efficiency improvement of up to 6.3%.</description></item><item><title>A High-Efficiency IPT System With Series-Capacitor Full-Bridge Configuration and Inverse Coupled Current Doubler Rectifier for High-Input, Low-Voltage, and High Output Current Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10557712</link><description>Different from the widely used high-voltage (HV) inductive power transfer (IPT) systems, the low-voltage IPT systems with HV input suffer from the following challenges: the high output current brings high conduction losses in the secondary side, especially at the receiver coil; and the HV conversion ratio, such as 400 V input and 24 V output, results in the difficulties in designing the compensation parameters and loosely coupled transformer. To overcome these issues, a novel IPT topology is proposed in this article by incorporating the series-capacitor full-bridge (SCFB) inverter and inverse coupled current doubler rectifier. Thus, the following three improvements are achieved: first, the voltage stress of three primary switches is reduced to half of the input voltage because of the special series capacitor structure. Second, the inherent one-fourth voltage conversion ratio is achieved and reduced greatly the difficulties in designing the compensation parameters. Third, the current flowing through rectifier circuit is reduced to half of conventional full-bridge rectifier. Furthermore, the LC-LCC compensation is employed for matching the proposed SCFB topology while a novel parameter optimization method is proposed to improve the conversion efficiency. To demonstrate the claimed features of the proposed solution, a 1.2 kW IPT prototype with 400 V input, constant voltage 24 V output is built and tested. The measured efficiency curve indicates that the efficiency from 8 to 50 A load keeps above 94.5% and peaks at 96.63%.</description></item><item><title>Identification and Control of LCC-S WPT Systems Using a Linear Parameter Varying Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559452</link><description>In this article, the problem of modeling and control of an LCC-S wireless power transfer (WPT) system in the presence of rectifier discontinuous conduction and load variation is considered. The diode bridge in an LCC-S WPT system often enters the discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), due to its unidirectional conductivity property. To better handle this type of nonlinearity, a linear parameter varying (LPV) model, which allows the model parameters to change with respect to a set of chosen dependence variables, is suggested to describe the dynamic behavior of the system. Based on this LPV model, a modified two degrees of freedom internal model control structure is proposed. The proposed control structure can switch between open loop and closed loop: when the system is in DCM, the system is configured as open loop because the load voltage or current is uncontrollable from the primary side, where any control action may impair the control system performance; otherwise, the system is operated in closed loop. Experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed modeling and control method.</description></item><item><title>Precise Modeling of Inductive Wireless Power Transfer With Lossy Magnetic Sheets</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10564574</link><description>Accurately analyzing power losses in inductive wireless power transfer (WPT) including lossy magnetic sheet is challenging, as coils have mutual influences on each other's power dissipation. This article proposes a precise analytic model for inductive WPT with lossy magnetic sheets. Combining a partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) with a two&#8211;port network, both self&#8211; and mutual-impedances of coupled coils are accurately calculated considering eddy current effects. Furthermore, the proposed PEEC&#8211;based model incorporates the complex permeabilities of lossy magnetic sheets, thus addressing a critical gap in previous studies that have not considered magnetic sheets with losses in their analysis. The suggested model is verified with finite element method (FEM) simulations and measurements. Compared with an FEM simulator, the proposed model calculates impedances about 31 times faster, substantially reducing the number of meshes. Finally, the ohmic and magnetic losses in coil windings and magnetic sheets are investigated with the proposed model, demonstrating that the phase adjustment of currents using the compensation capacitor is effective to reduce the losses caused by eddy currents and lossy magnetic sheets. The proposed model offers more detailed and accurate loss analysis, compared to conventional methods based on circuit analysis.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Misalignment Tolerance in Hybrid Wireless Power Transfer System With Integrated Coupler via Frequency Tuning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10566036</link><description>To enhance the misalignment tolerance and system integration of the wireless power transfer (WPT) system, an integrated coupler consisting of capacitors and coils overlapped coaxially is proposed in this article and integrated into the hybrid WPT (HWPT) system without extra compensation components. The system utilizes the complementary characteristics of different transmission channels to realize the synergistic transfer of different coupled powers under a wide coupling range. Based on the mutual influence between capacitors and coils in terms of electrical parameters in a limited axial projection area and the zero-phase-angle condition considering the mutual capacitance obtained by the fundamental harmonics approximation method, the method of regulating the transfer ratio of the two types of coupled powers is mastered. A method to realize the HWPT with high misalignment tolerance characteristics by frequency tracking is proposed to solve the problem of the system's resonant state being disrupted when the position of the integrated coupler is misaligned. The field-circuit coupling model verifies the feasibility of the analysis and transfer method. Finally, an experimental verification platform for 500 W is built to achieve 82.7% power transfer in the WPT system with 40% unidirectional misalignment.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Electromagnetic Performance Optimization of Double-Layer Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous Machine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10500893</link><description>Permanent magnet (PM) machines garner significant attention due to their high-power density and high efficiency. As research progresses, high-end motor applications are placing higher and more comprehensive performance demands on PM machines, driving the need for multifaceted and synergistic motor design optimization. In response to this demand, this article proposes a multi-objective optimization design process aimed at improving the overall electromagnetic performance of PM machines.

The optimization process utilizes a meta-model fitted to the numerical model solved by the finite element method, leading to a substantial acceleration of the overall optimization process. Furthermore, an optimization approach is employed to optimize several key structural parameters of a double layer interior PM machine using an evolutionary algorithm. The resulting optimized motor is fabricated and tested, and both numerical simulations and experiments validate that the optimized motor exhibits enhanced torque, low torque ripple, and avoids resonance vibration noise near the rated speed. This comprehensive validation confirms the effectiveness of the structural design and the optimization process.</description></item><item><title>Development of a Compact and Contactless Stage Capable of Levitating/Rotating Wafer Functioning as an Ultrasonically Virtual Hand</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472714</link><description>This article presents a compact and contactless stage capable of levitating/rotating the wafer via hybrid excitation of standing waves (SWs) and traveling waves (TWs). The stage incorporates two concentrically- arranged irradiators, where the inner one sends out powerful SW to accomplish the levitation while the outer one generates the TW whose intensity and direction are modulatable to achieve the rotation. Interestingly, the stage is regarded as an ultrasonically virtual hand with the holding and plucking functions. Initially, the SW- and TW- irradiators&#8217; configurations are designed to tune the resonance frequency of each component and enhance the air pressure. Subsequently, through acousto-structural analysis, the levitation force and propulsion torque are estimated to numerically discuss the acoustic properties of the air gap between the stage and the wafer. Finally, a stage prototype 220 mm in diameter and 390 mm in height is fabricated to assess its performance. At 20.3 kHz working frequency and 400 V voltage, the stage yielded the maximal levitation height of &#8764;1 mm. Meanwhile, the maximal rotation speeds reach 0.15 and 0.16 rad/s in the clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of our proposal and demonstrate the stage's potential for the semi-conductor manufacturing industry.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Voltage-Guaranteed Control of DC/DC-Buck-Converter-Interfaced DC Microgrids With Constant Power Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472613</link><description>Bus voltage control is a crucial issue in dc microgrids. Constant power loads (CPLs) exhibit negative incremental impedance characteristics and tend to affect the operation of the microgrid system. To this end, most of the existing methods concentrate on ensuring the steady-state performance of the system while the transient performance is often overlooked. Hence, this article proposes an adaptive voltage-guaranteed controller for the dc/dc buck converter feeding CPLs to enhance both steady-state and transient performances. First, a constrained function is utilized to incorporate the voltage constraint into the modeling of a buck converter. Second, the adaptive update laws are constructed to estimate uncertainties/disturbances for different operation conditions. Finally, the design guideline of the proposed adaptive controller is presented using the backstepping theory. Through the aforementioned design procedures, the proposed controller can keep the bus voltage working within the prespecified range even when large-signal disturbances happen. The stability of the closed-loop system is proved by using the Lyapunov stability theory. Both simulations and experimental studies are conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed controller.</description></item><item><title>Investigation of Power Cycling Degradation on the Dynamic ON-Resistance of HD-GITs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472623</link><description>As promising candidates for high-performance power system applications, gallium nitride high electron mobility transistors (GaN HEMTs) have received a lot of attention from the market. However, reliability issues, particularly the dynamic on-resistance (dR$_{\text{DS(ON)}}$), also known as the current collapse effect, severely limit the promotion and application of GaN HEMTs. This article investigates and compares the dR$_{\text{DS(ON)}}$ under various power cycle aging conditions for hybrid drain-embedded gate injection transistors (HD-GITs), which serve as representative devices of GaN HEMTs. For the purpose of this, HD-GITs are prepared using power cycling tests, and a voltage clamping circuit is employed to accurately measure the dR$_{\text{DS(ON)}}$ during the switching applications in both the double-pulse test and the multipulse test. Experimental results demonstrate that, under certain conditions, the dR$_{\text{DS(ON)}}$ of the device deteriorates as it ages. Furthermore, the primary mechanisms responsible for the deterioration of dR$_{\text{DS(ON)}}$ characteristics under different aging states are discussed based on systematic electrical test results and reasonable inference. The finds are of great significance for guiding the design, manufacture, and application of GaN devices.</description></item><item><title>A Fast and Sensitive Current Differential Protection for MMC-HVDC Lines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10495727</link><description>This article proposes a fast and sensitive current differential protection (CDP) for modular multilevel converter based high voltage direct current lines. This method utilizes the fully distributed and frequency dependent (FD) line model to compensate for the influence of FD parameters, thus achieving high sensitivity. The improved curve fitting scheme in the FD line model is provided to enable the formulation of the differential current. Then, a fast time domain convolution scheme is specially designed to achieve the capability of the real-time calculation with the FD line model, and therefore guarantee the high response speed. A comparative analysis between the proposed CDP and the existing Bergeron based CDP is utilized to demonstrate the superior sensitivity and faster response speed of the proposed method. Moreover, the proposed method only requires a relatively low sampling rate and can complete internal fault detection within 3 ms after the fault occurs. Hardware-in-the-loop experiments using real time digital simulator are also conducted to verify the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Fault Diagnosis of DC/DC Buck Converter for Embedded Applications Based on BO-ELM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472681</link><description>With the increasing demand for ocean missions, the development of autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) has flourished. AMVs rely on electricity to power various systems, so the high reliability and stability of dc-dc converters are critical to the normal operation of AMVs. In reality, fault diagnosis and optimization of converters under the low sampling frequency and computational capability conditions remain practical challenges. This article focuses on the buck converter circuit and utilizes undersampling techniques to obtain output voltage signals sampled at a low sampling frequency. Support vector machine recursive feature elimination is employed for feature selection to reduce computation. Bayesian optimization-based extreme learning machine is used for fault diagnosis, which is suitable for actual deployment and shown to outperform three classical machine learning models. The diagnosis results are used to propose a reliability optimization strategy involving switching frequency adjustment. Physical experiments based on a digital signal processor prove the feasibility of this method.</description></item><item><title>Single-Ended Protection of VSC-HVdc Outgoing Line Based on Backward Traveling Wave Time-Domain Weighted Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10500473</link><description>This article considers the problems of high difficulty in fault analysis of direct current (dc) line in a voltage source converter (VSC)&#8211;high-voltage direct current (HVdc) outgoing system from wind farms and the poor adaptability of traditional protection principle. To solve these problems, this article proposes single-ended protection of the VSC-HVdc outgoing line based on the time-domain weighted optimization (TDWO) of a fault backward traveling wave (BTW). The analysis of the propagation process of the internal fault (IF) and external fault (EF) voltage BTW and the attenuation characteristics of the dc line and boundary shows that the voltage BTW measured by the protection element decreases significantly under IF. When an EF occurs, the variation range of the voltage measured by the protection element is small, and the higher the frequency is, the more significant the difference between them is. The fault data are optimized by using the time-domain weighted coefficient, and the fault distinction between the IF and EF is expanded. In addition, the fault identification criterion is constructed according to the time-domain weighted coefficient. The proposed protection method is verified by experiments using a renewable energy grid-connected system constructed on a real-time digital simulation (RTDS) platform. The experimental results show that the proposed protection method can identify faults rapidly with a small amount of calculation and realize the full-line action with high speed, reliability, and sensitivity. The maximum achievable sampling rate for safeguarding equipment is up to 50 kHz; the proposed method, with a sampling rate of 20 kHz, has an application value in practical engineering.</description></item><item><title>Intrinsic Causality Embedded Concurrent Quality and Process Monitoring Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472781</link><description>The causality between different variables can reveal the flows of material, energy, and information in the process system. It is beneficial to reflect the relationship between quality variables and process variables. In this study, a concurrent quality and process monitoring method is proposed with intrinsic causality analytics. The proposed method explores the causality between different variables using transfer entropy. Then, the directly related variables and their corresponding time lags are combined to extract convolutional features, which are used to generate feature matrices for process and quality variables. In this way, the quality related information is extracted from the process variables which are directly related to the quality variables. After that, monitoring models are established for each pair of feature matrices, and the monitoring results are integrated to provide a final monitoring result. Since the process disturbances usually smear to directly related variables, the fault signature can be amplified to improve the detection sensitivity when the directly related variables are combined. Finally, the operation status of the process system is identified through the designed monitoring policy, which combines the decisions of different statistics. It is noted that the proposed strategy can be readily generalized to many other existing quality related monitoring methods. Experiments on a real industrial condenser show that the proposed method can distinguish the quality related faults from the process related faults in the condenser. Besides, it has better detection sensitivity than some commonly used quality related monitoring methods.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Power Splitting and Conversion in Ferrite/Piezoelectric Transformer Magnetoelectric Composites</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472890</link><description>Developing efficient power-splitting device for multichannel distributed low-frequency (LF) mechanical antenna (MA) communication system is challenging since conventional LF power-splitting technologies rely on lumped resistive elements with unsatisfied efficiency and poor electrical isolation. In view of this, a magnetoelectric (ME) power splitter consisting of nickel&#8211;zinc ferrite and Rosen-type piezoelectric transformer composite was modeled, fabricated, and packaged with a supporting theory to quantitatively describe the power-splitting ratio. To reveal the energy loss between interlayers, a noncontact optical Doppler measurement was employed to track the energy losses between interlayers. Results show that favorable input-to-output isolation with a high insulation voltage of 2.35 kV in the packaged device was obtained, and the maximum PE for Port I and Port II reached 34.45% and 35.87% at RL = 1 k&#937; and RL = 13 k&#937;, respectively, in tailored sample with thickness ratio of np = 0.412, and then the measured splitting ratio approximates 1.1 and matches well with the theoretical predictions. Finally, the proposed ME splitter was deployed in a dual-channel distributed LF communication system for implementing each MA excitation, the system divided one source into two independent transmitting ME antennas and accomplished 20 bps amplitude shift keying modulated signal delivery to searching coils under a distance of 125 cm and an input power of 3.57 mW.</description></item><item><title>A Two-Stage Interpolation Time-to-Digital Converter Implemented in 20 and 28 nm FGPAs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472783</link><description>This article presents a two-stage interpolation time-to-digital converter (TDC), combining a Vernier gray code oscillator TDC (VGCO-TDC) and a tapped-delay line TDC (TDL-TDC). The proposed TDC uses the Nutt method to achieve a broad, high-resolution measurement range. It utilizes look-up tables based gray code oscillators to build a VGCO-TDC as the first-stage interpolation for fine-time measurements. Then the overtaking residual from the VGCO-TDC is measured by a TDL-TDC to achieve the second-stage interpolation. Due to the two-stage interpolation architecture, the carry-chain-based delay line only needs to cover the resolution of the VGCO-TDC. Hence, we can reduce the delay-line length and related hardware resource utilization. We implemented and evaluated a 16-channel TDC system in Xilinx 20-nm Kintex-UltraScale and 28-nm Virtex-7 field-programmable gate arrays. The Kintex-UltraScale version achieves an average resolution [least significant bit (LSB)] of 4.57 picoseconds (ps) with 4.36 LSB average peak-to-peak differential nonlinearity (DNLpk-pk). The Virtex-7 version achieves an average resolution of 10.05 ps with 2.85 LSB average DNLpk-pk.</description></item><item><title>A Strong Offset-Resistant Electric Vehicle Wireless Charging System Based on Dual Decoupled Receiving Coils</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472778</link><description>In an electric vehicle wireless charging system, the dramatic variation of the mutual inductance caused by the coil misalignment is an urgent problem to be solved. An offset-resistant wireless charging system based on dual decoupled receiving coils is proposed, with one receiving coil as the unipolar coil and the other as the quadrupolar coil. With series compensation, they are connected in series through the diode rectifier. In this way, the total equivalent mutual inductance is the summation of the absolute values of the two mutual inductances. Thus, the total equivalent mutual inductance can remain stable against misalignment, guaranteeing a stable system output. Experimental results confirm that the designed system has good misalignment tolerance capability in two perpendicular directions, enabling stable and efficient power transmission. Along the misalignment, the output voltage fluctuation is only 2.81% with the highest system efficiency of 94.68%.</description></item><item><title>Synchronization Stability Analysis Under Ultra-Weak Grid Considering Reactive Current Dynamics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10476724</link><description>The synchronization stability of grid-following converter has attracted extensive attention. It has been reported that the transient synchronization behavior during a grid fault is dominated by the phase-locked loop (PLL), while the current loop is always approximated as a unity gain. Nevertheless, this letter notices that the reactive current dynamics will also influence the synchronization stability under ultra-weak grid, which increases the risk of losing synchronization, and causes the PLL output frequency to be outside the limitation. Accordingly, a refined fourth-order model is proposed to reveal the above underlying mechanism and quantify this coupling effect.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Impedance Compensation Method for IPT System Applying Inverse Coupled Current Doubler Rectifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10462682</link><description>Inverse coupled current doubler rectifier (ICCDR) has been applied in high output current scenarios due to its higher current gain and rectification efficiency than diode full-bridge rectifier. However, existing analysis about ICCDR has nonnegligible errors because the inductance effect of a transformer is simply ignored. In this letter, the inductance effect and energy storage-release process of transformer are taken into account innovatively. Then, an accurate input impedance model of ICCDR is first established via modal analysis, whose equivalent inductor leads to poor constant current effect within large load range. Based on this input impedance model, a novel compensation method, which can eliminate the impact of its equivalent inductor and optimize constant current output effect by tuning primary capacitance, is provided. The proposed S-S compensated inductive power transfer system applying ICCDR achieves zero phase angle and shows a &#177;5% output current change rate within 8:1 load resistance range. The analysis is verified by a 20-A output prototype, which shows a peak efficiency of 95.6%.</description></item><item><title>Modulation and Control Independent Dead-Zone Compensation for H-Bridge Converters: A Simplified Digital Logic Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472893</link><description>The H-bridge (HB) converters are essential components in various power typologies, offering dual energy flow, increasing power density, and enhancing extensibility. For the HB converters, the dead zone plays a crucial role in avoiding power semiconductors against shoot-through phenomenon in the phase leg of an HB converter. However, it also negatively affects the quality of the output ac currents, impacting system performance. This letter introduces a simplified digital logic-based scheme that effectively compensates for the dead zone in HB converters. Initially, the scheme examines the repercussions of dead zones in HB converter. Subsequently, it adjusts pulsewidth modulation signal waveforms by either delaying the leading edge or the lagging edge for the dead-zone compensation, irrespective of the control and modulation methods employed. Furthermore, extensibility of the proposed scheme to other power converters, such as a neutral-point-clamped converter is discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is validated by experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Calculating Probabilistic Carbon Emission Flow: An Adaptive Regression-Based Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10414125</link><description>Carbon intensities are beginning to be used as incentives for consumer-driven carbon reduction. Guided by time-varying carbon intensities, consumers can schedule loads in priority order to use more electricity during low-carbon periods. However, carbon intensities cannot be perfectly forecasted in advance due to the fluctuation of loads and renewable energy. The probabilistic distribution of carbon intensities can be calculated by the grid operator and used as a reference for power consumers. This paper presents a probabilistic carbon emission flow model to calculate the distribution of carbon intensities for consumers. An adaptive regression-based calculation framework combined with a carbon pattern dictionary technique is proposed to handle the high calculation complexity caused by the nonlinearity of the carbon emission flow model. The simulation results from the case studies demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Quantum Grover Search-Inspired Global Maximum Power Point Tracking for Photovoltaic Systems Under Partial Shading Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418984</link><description>Tracking the global maximum power point (GMPP) of photovoltaic (PV) arrays under partial shading conditions (PSCs) is a critical research area.

The dispatch policy is designed to account for both calendrical and cyclical aging effects on BESS, explicitly modeling the impacts of ambient temperature on BESS lifespan. The proposed ADP employs an adaptive critic method and enhanced off-policy deterministic policy gradient (DPG) strategy, addressing the limitations of the on-policy gradient-based ADP approaches, including inadequate exploration, low data usage, and computational complexity. In particular, a customized policy is proposed to guide the algorithm to explore some promising decisions and thereby improve exploration capability and learning efficiency compared to conventional DPG-based learning approaches, which may struggle to find a global optimum due to random noisy action-based exploration or require expert demonstration with extra effort. The proposed method is illustrated using the IEEE 123-node system and compared with the existing ADP methods to prove solution accuracy and demonstrate the effects of incorporating degradation models into control design. Case studies showed that the proposed ADP effectively coordinates DERs with a 10 times smaller optimization gap compared to existing methods, and the incorporation of the BESS life loss model into the proposed control ensures the expected lifespan and results in significant cost savings.</description></item><item><title>Higher Order Sliding Mode Observer Based Fast Composite Backstepping Control for HESS in DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10432969</link><description>Hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is effective to compensate for fluctuation power in renewables and fast fluctuation loads in DC microgrids. To regulate DC bus voltage, a power management strategy is an essential issue. In the meantime, the increasing integration of constant power loads (CPLs) in DC microgrids brings great challenges to stable operation due to their negative incremental impedance. In this paper, a fast composite backstepping control (FBC) method is proposed for the HESS to achieve faster dynamics, smaller voltage variations, and large-signal stabilization. In the FBC method, a higher order sliding mode observer (HOSMO) is adopted to estimate the coupled disturbances. Furthermore, the FBC method is integrated with the droop control; so that the FBC-based decentralized power allocation (FBC-DPA) strategy for HESS in DC microgrids is developed. The proposed FBC method is designed based on the Lyapunov function to ensure its stability. Moreover, the design guidelines are provided to facilitate the application of the proposed method. Both simulation and experimental studies under different operating scenarios show that the proposed method achieves faster voltage recovery and smaller voltage variations than the conventional backstepping control method.</description></item><item><title>Rotor Speed Control in Above-Rated Wind Speed Region for Floating Offshore Wind Turbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433765</link><description>Large oscillations of the rotor speed are often observed in floating offshore wind turbines (FOWTs) operating in above-rated wind speed region. This phenomenon drastically increases the mechanical fatigue loads and even causes damage to the generator. To address this problem, this article first establishes a Reduced-Order Speed-Control-Oriented Model (ROSCOM), which demonstrates the nonlinear coupling of the platform pitch motion and the turbine rotor rotation. The oscillation mechanism is then revealed that the platform pitch motion acts as the zero dynamics of ROSCOM, which can produce limit cycles and result in large oscillations of rotor speed. Based on the Bendixson criterion and Hopf bifurcation theorem, limit cycles and Hopf bifurcation in the platform pitch motion are identified and proved. Additionally, a nonlinear generator torque compensation strategy, named Non-Minimum Phase Platform Pitch Compensation (NMP$^{3}$C), is designed to eliminate the limit cycles in the FOWT system. The rotor speed control performance is thus greatly improved. Electromagnetic power variation, platform pitch variation and tower base fore-aft fatigue loads are also mitigated. Digital simulations based on OpenFAST verify the analysis results and the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Cluster-Based Distributed Secondary Control of Large-Scale DC Microgrid Cluster System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433685</link><description>With the high integration of distributed renewable energies, microgrid (MG) cluster system, consisting of complex physical structures and complicated networked control structure, has emerged as a growing trend. Currently, several secondary control strategies including centralized, decentralized and distributed control have been proposed to solve the secondary voltage restoration and power sharing problem in single DC MG systems. However, few efforts have been made on the secondary control of MG cluster system. In this paper, a first attempt on designing a decentralized cluster-based distributed secondary control strategy is made towards the goal of accurate voltage restoration and power sharing in the DC MG cluster system. Specifically, for the DGs within the same cluster, a distributed finite-time control approach is proposed, while no information exchange is involved among different clusters. As a consequence, all the distributed controllers of different clusters are totally decentralized. If each cluster has only one DG, our proposed control strategy reduces to the existing decentralized ones, while the case of one cluster boils down to distributed control. Rigorous theoretical analysis is provided for such control strategy. Compared to existing methods, our proposed strategy has better transient and steady-state performance than purely decentralized and better robustness than distributed ones. The proposed method is validated in an experimental test system built in OPAL-RT.</description></item><item><title>Synchronverters With Fault Ride-Through Capabilities for Reliable Microgrid Protection During Balanced and Unbalanced Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10433740</link><description>Synchronverters are inverters that provide damping and inertia, similar to synchronous generators. Like traditional inverters, synchronverters are adaptable to the microgrid's operation modes. However, synchronverters may generate oscillatory active and reactive powers during faults and produce phase currents with excessive magnitudes. Therefore, this paper develops two fault ride-through (FRT) strategies for synchronverters: average power control and enhanced power control. Both strategies aim to reduce power oscillations, limit current generation, and ensure compliance with grid codes during faults, regardless of the fault conditions and the grid's operation mode. Additionally, synchronverters with the proposed FRT strategies are incorporated into an optimal protection coordination (OPC) program for microgrid protection. The OPC program obtains the settings of time-current-voltage overcurrent relays (TIV-OCRs) and demonstrates the effect of the proposed FRT strategies on microgrid protection. The obtained settings are suitable for both the microgrid's grid-connected and islanded modes during balanced and unbalanced faults. Evaluation results demonstrate the capability of the proposed strategies to reduce power oscillations, limit current generation, and comply with grid codes. Furthermore, the OPC results reveal the most appropriate strategy to minimize TIV-OCRs' operating times in a coordinated manner, regardless of the fault type and microgrid operating mode.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Dimensional Holomorphic Embedding Method for Probabilistic Energy Flow Calculation in Integrated Distribution Power and Heating System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10438069</link><description>A fast probabilistic energy flow (PEF) analysis method is proposed for integrated distribution power and heating system (IPHS) operations. The proposed solution will overcome the low efficiency of the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method for calculating the probabilistic energy flows (PEFs) iteratively, which will require an exhaustive set of energy flow calculations for a large number of samples. First, we use the multi-dimensional holomorphic embedding method (MDHEM) to derive the analytical energy flow expressions, so that the solutions for massive scenarios can be obtained by merely substituting the boundary conditions into expressions. Second, a PEF analysis model is established based on the analytical method for evaluating the impact of uncertainties on IPHSs, and accelerating the efficiency of traditional MCS methods significantly.

However, sudden variations in the magnitude and phase angle of grid voltage during grid faults may result in the phase-locked loop transient response (PLTR) of DPMWT. The PLTR changes the output characteristics of DPMWT through converter control loop. This alteration incorporates dynamic control errors and presents potential hazards to the transient frequency of power system. Therefore, the dynamic control error resulting from PLTR under the three-phase fault is found, and an emergency frequency control method for DPMWT under the three-phase fault is proposed. The quantification method for PLTR under the three-phase fault is proposed, and the conduction paths of PLTR within the converter control loop are analyzed. The mechanism of dynamic control error of DPMWT under the three-phase fault is analyzed, and the calculation method for dynamic control error is further proposed. Moreover, the transient frequency characteristics of the power system when affected by dynamic control error are analyzed, and the emergency frequency control method for DPMWT based on the compensation of dynamic control error is put forward. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by case studies.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Forming Control for Solid Oxide Fuel Cells in an Islanded Microgrid Using Maximum Power Point Estimation Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10449436</link><description>Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) are promising distributed generation technologies for their controllability and efficiency. Traditional SOFCs are controlled as a current source to deliver predefined power to the grid. Since a microgrid can operate in both grid-connected mode and islanded mode, grid-forming control ability is required for SOFCs to achieve voltage/ frequency regulation. However, when subjected to load transients, nonlinear output characteristics of SOFCs would probably lead to the collapse of dc-link voltage and unintentional disconnection of SOFCs. To deal with this issue, grid-forming control for SOFCs is presented considering nonlinear characteristics between output current and voltage. The maximum power point (MPP) of SOFCs is tracked using proposed incremental impedance (INI) method and dc-link voltage difference is delivered to adjust output frequency of ac side. In this condition, stable operation and load sharing can be achieved simultaneously during load transients. Simulation results based on PSCAD/EMTDC are provided to validate the effectiveness of proposed grid-forming control.</description></item><item><title>Carbon-Embedded Nodal Energy Price in Hydrogen-Blended Integrated Electricity and Gas Systems With Heterogeneous Gas Compositions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10458410</link><description>Blending green hydrogen from renewable generations into the natural gas infrastructure can effectively mitigate carbon emissions of energy consumers. However, distributed hydrogen blending could lead to heterogeneous gas compositions across the network. The traditional nodal energy price scheme is designed for uniform gas composition, which cannot reflect the impacts of heterogeneous nodal gas composition and carbon emission mitigation. This paper proposes a novel nodal energy price scheme in hydrogen-blended integrated electricity and gas systems (H-IEGS). First, we propose a joint market-clearing model for H-IEGS, where the nonlinear physical properties of gas mixtures caused by heterogeneous gas compositions are characterized. The impacts of hydrogen blending on the carbon emission cost are also quantified. To retrieve the nodal energy price from this highly nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problem, a successive second-order cone programming (SSOCP) method is tailored to get the dual variables tractably. Considering the continuous market clearing process, a warm-start technique is proposed to provide initial reference points for the SSOCP to improve computation efficiency. Finally, an H-IEGS test case in Belgium and a large-scale practical case in Northwest China are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A Sea-State-Dependent Control Strategy for Wave Energy Converters: Power Limiting in Large Wave Conditions and Energy Maximising in Moderate Wave Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10460174</link><description>Conventional control strategies for wave energy converters (WECs) maximise power capture of the WEC by amplifying its responses, but this exacerbates hardware constraint violations not generally taken into account, causing undesirable shutdown of electrical systems in adverse wave conditions. When WECs operate close to power take-off (PTO) capacity, the primary control objective is to limit peak power for hardware protection purposes, enabling longer continuous electricity generation time. In this paper, we propose a sea-state-dependent control strategy based on model predictive control to maximise the annual energy production of a WEC with a realistic PTO: in small to moderate sea states it adopts a conventional energy-maximising objective function to increase output power, while in higher sea states a speed-limiting objective function may be utilised to enable longer generating time before shutdown becomes necessary. While this control strategy applies to a wide range of WECs, here we carry out the case study on an attenuator WEC called M4, with gearbox transmission and a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) as its PTO, which is being designed for a 1/4 scale ocean test in Albany, Australia. Simulation results show that compared with a benchmark passive damping controller, a 66% increase in annual energy production can be expected at the targeted site.</description></item><item><title>Addressing Wind Power Forecast Errors in Day-Ahead Pricing With Energy Storage Systems: A Distributionally Robust Joint Chance-Constrained Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10461088</link><description>The rapid integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) has imposed substantial uncertainty and variability on the operation of power markets, which calls for unprecedentedly flexible generation resources such as batteries. In this paper, we develop a novel pricing mechanism for day-ahead electricity markets to adeptly accommodate the uncertainties stemming from RESs. First, a distributionally robust joint chance-constrained (DRJCC) economic dispatch model that incorporates energy storage systems is presented, ensuring that the DRJCCs are satisfied across a moment-based ambiguity set enriched with unimodality-skewness characteristics. Second, by applying the Bonferroni approximation method to tackle the DRJCCs, we show that the proposed model can be transformed into a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem. Building on the SOCP reformulation, we then precisely derive the electricity prices, including the energy, reserve, and uncertainty prices. Furthermore, we prove that the obtained pricing mechanism supports a robust competitive equilibrium under specific premises. Finally, a PJM 5-bus test system and the IEEE 118-bus test system are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the suggested approach, underscoring its potential contributions to modern power market operations.</description></item><item><title>Two-Critic Deep Reinforcement Learning for Inverter-Based Volt-Var Control in Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10470443</link><description>A two-critic deep reinforcement learning (TC-DRL) approach for inverter-based volt-var control (IB-VVC) in active distribution networks is proposed in this paper. Considering two objectives of VVC, minimizing power loss and eliminating voltage violations, have different mathematical properties, we utilize two critics to approximate two objectives separately, which reduces the learning difficulties of each critic. The TC-DRL approach cooperates well with many actor-critic DRL algorithms for the centralized IB-VVC problems, and two centralized DRL algorithms were designed as examples. For decentralized IB-VVC, we extend the approach to a multi-agent TC-DRL approach and further simplify the multi-agent DRL approach with all agents sharing the same centralized two-critic. Extensive simulation experiments show that the proposed two centralized TC-DRL algorithms require fewer iteration times and return better results than the recent DRL algorithms, and the multi-agent TC-DRL algorithms work well for decentralized IB-VVC problems with different limited real-time measurement conditions.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Joint Distributionally Robust Chance-Constrained Operation for Multiple Integrated Electricity and Heating Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475580</link><description>Integrating heating and electricity networks offers extra flexibility to the energy system operation while improving energy utilization efficiency. This paper proposes a data-driven joint distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) operation model for multiple integrated electricity and heating systems (IEHSs). Flexible reserve resources in IEHS are exploited to mitigate the uncertainty of renewable energy. A distributed and parallel joint DRCC operation framework is developed to preserve the decision-making independence of multiple IEHSs, where the optimized CVaR approximation (OCA) approach is developed to transform the local joint DRCC model into a tractable model. An alternating minimization algorithm is presented to improve the tightness of OCA for joint chance constraints by iteratively tuning the OCA. Case studies on the IEEE 33-bus system with four IEHSs and the IEEE 141-bus system with eight IEHSs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Stability Enhancement of Power Synchronisation Control Based Grid-Forming Inverter Under Varying Network Characteristics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10476727</link><description>Power synchronisation control (PSC) is commonly used in voltage source inverters due to its grid-forming capability and superior performance under weak grid conditions as compared to other grid-forming inverter (GFMI) strategies. However, there is a notable gap in understanding the application and performance of PSC under various practical operating scenarios, particularly in different network types. This paper addresses this critical shortcoming by conducting an in-depth analysis of PSC-based GFMIs under different network types, utilising a comprehensive mathematical and dynamic simulation models. The analysis reveals that the PSC-based GFMI system encounters instability in predominantly resistive networks. To address this issue, two decoupling strategies, namely virtual power (VP)-based and virtual impedance (VI)-based, are proposed to improve power-sharing accuracy and enhance system stability. Furthermore, the improved performance of these proposed strategies is verified in real-time using the IEEE-39 bus network on the OPAL-RT platform. The validation results reaffirm the suitability of PSC-based GFMI in all practical networks.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive Approach for Probabilistic Wind Power Forecasting Based on Meta-Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10476768</link><description>This paper studies an adaptive approach for probabilistic wind power forecasting (WPF) including offline and online learning procedures. In the offline learning stage, a base forecast model is trained via inner and outer loop updates of meta-learning, which endows the base forecast model with excellent adaptability to different forecast tasks, i.e., probabilistic WPF with different lead times or locations. In the online learning stage, the base forecast model is applied to online forecasting combined with incremental learning techniques. On this basis, the online forecast takes full advantage of recent information and the adaptability of the base forecast model. Two applications are developed based on our proposed approach concerning forecasting with different lead times (temporal adaptation) and forecasting for newly established wind farms (spatial adaptation), respectively. Numerical tests were conducted on real-world wind power data sets. Simulation results validate the advantages in adaptivity of the proposed methods compared with existing alternatives.</description></item><item><title>MADRL-Based DSO-Customer Coordinated Bi-Level Volt/VAR Optimization Method for Power Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478208</link><description>The high penetration of customer-side variable PVs could change power distribution networks (PDNs) operations and lead to frequent nodal voltage violations. The grid-side static var compensators (SVCs), controlled by distribution system operators (DSO), and customer-side PV inverters are usually used as fast devices to mitigate voltage problems caused by PVs. To effectively coordinate these two types of VAR resources with different ownerships, this paper proposes the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach, which uses the asymmetric Markov game (ASMG) method to implement a cooperative bi-level Volt/VAR optimization (VVO) framework. In this framework, DSO is the leader, which makes decisions at the upper level to minimize the PDNs energy losses by regulating SVCs, and customers are the followers, which make decisions at the lower level by regulating PV inverters to mitigate nodal voltage deviations. Furthermore, a model-free Bi-level Actor-Critic (Bi-AC) algorithm is proposed to solve the ASMG problem, which defines the agents&#8217; decision priorities so that the follower agents can always execute the best response policy. The effectiveness of the proposed Bi-AC method is verified by utilizing improved IEEE 33-bus and IEEE 118-bus case with practical grid operation data.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Dynamic Power Sharing Control for Frequency Regulation Using Hybrid Hydrogen Electrolyzer Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478586</link><description>Hydrogen electrolyzers are promising tools for frequency regulation of future power systems with high penetration of renewable energies and low inertia. This is due to both the increasing demand for hydrogen and their flexibility as controllable load. The two main electrolyzer technologies are Alkaline Electrolyzers (AELs) and Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzers (PEMELs). However, they have trade-offs: dynamic response speed for AELs, and cost for PEMELs. This paper proposes the combination of both technologies into a Hybrid Hydrogen Electrolyzer System (HHES) to obtain a fast response for frequency regulation with reduced costs. A decentralized dynamic power sharing control strategy is proposed where PEMELs respond to the fast component of the frequency deviation, and AELs respond to the slow component, without the requirement of communication. The proposed decentralized approach facilitates a high reliability and scalability of the system, what is essential for expansion of hydrogen production. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated in simulations and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Aggregate Model of District Heating Network for Integrated Energy Dispatch: A Physically Informed Data-Driven Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10485435</link><description>The district heating network (DHN) is essential in enhancing the operational flexibility of integrated energy systems (IES). Yet, it is hard to obtain an accurate and concise DHN model for the operation owing to complicated network features and imperfect measurements. Considering this, this paper proposes a physically informed data-driven aggregate model (AGM) for the DHN, providing a concise description of the source-load relationship of DHN without exposing network details. First, we derive the analytical relationship between the state variables of the source and load nodes of the DHN, offering a physical fundament for the AGM. Second, we propose a physics-informed estimator for the AGM that is robust to low-quality measurements, in which the physical constraints associated with the parameter normalization and sparsity are embedded to improve the accuracy and robustness. Finally, we propose a physics-enhanced algorithm to solve the nonlinear estimator with non-closed constraints efficiently. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Modeling the Coupling of Rotor Speed, primary Frequency Reserve and Virtual Inertia of Wind Turbines in Frequency Constrained Look-Ahead Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10496871</link><description>With the increasing penetration of wind power, wind turbines (WTs) are required to provide primary frequency reserve (PFR) and virtual inertia support to the grid to ensure frequency security. However, in existing frequency-constrained scheduling research, the coupling of WTs' rotor speed, PFR and virtual inertia has been overlooked. This paper accurately models the PFR capacity and virtual inertia of WTs based on WT's rotor speed control and frequency control. Besides, a frequency-constrained stochastic look-ahead economic dispatch (FCS-LAED) model, which co-optimizes the PFR, virtual inertia and rotor speed of WTs is proposed. In this model, WTs' operation constraints are considered more comprehensively compared with existing research. A combination of convex hull relaxation and McCormick envelope is employed to convexify the proposed FCS-LAED model. To further tighten the relaxation, a modified sequential bound tightening method is proposed. Case studies on the modified IEEE 6-bus system and IEEE 118-bus system verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and methods.</description></item><item><title>Stability Constrained Optimal Operation of Inverter-Dominant Microgrids: A Two Stage Robust Optimization Framework</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10497873</link><description>To mitigate the stability issues in the droop-controlled isolated microgrids brought by aleatory renewable energy sources (RESs), which can be added at any given time, this paper proposes a two-stage robust coordination strategy to optimize the operation of multiple flexible resources. In the first stage, a day-ahead unit commitment (UC) schedule of microturbines(MTs) is formulated considering the uncertainty of RESs and loads. In the second stage, an hourly power dispatch and droop gains adjustment scheme for the energy storage devices are developed to minimize the operation cost and ensure the small signal stability. An adaptive column and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) algorithm is developed to solve the stability-constrained two-stage robust optimization problem. Simulation results on a 33-bus microgrid system reveal that compared to benchmarking approaches, the proposed coordination strategy is able to guarantee the small-signal stability with lower cost. And a sensitivity analysis validates the robustness of the methodology against the uncertainties of RESs.</description></item><item><title>A Decision-Dependent Hydrogen Supply Infrastructure Planning Approach Considering Causality Between Vehicles and Stations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10497898</link><description>In the early commercialization stage of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs), reasonable hydrogen supply infrastructure (HSI) planning is a premise for promoting the popularization of HFCVs. However, there is a strong causality between HFCVs and hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs): the planning decisions of HRSs could affect the hydrogen refueling demand of HFCVs, and the growth of demand would in turn stimulate the further investment in HRSs, which is prompted by the chicken-egg conundrum. Meanwhile, there is a cost contradiction between energy planning and hydrogen refueling convenience of HFCVs caused by HRSs siting planning. To this end, this work establishes a multi-network HSI planning model coordinating hydrogen, power, and transportation networks. Then, to reflect the causal relation between HFCVs and HRSs effectively in the early stage of hydrogen infrastructure investment planning without sufficient historical data, hydrogen demand decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) and a distributionally robust optimization framework are developed. The uncertainty of hydrogen demand is modeled as a Wasserstein ambiguity set with a decision-dependent empirical probability distribution. Subsequently, to reduce the computational complexity caused by the introduction of a large number of scenarios and high-dimensional nonlinear constraints, we developed an improved distribution shaping method and techniques of scenario and variable reduction to derive the solvable form with less computing burden. Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that this method can reduce costs by at least 7.7% compared with traditional methods and will be more effective in large-scale HSI planning issues. Further, we put forward effective suggestions for the policymakers and investors.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Optimal Scheduling With Heterogeneous Uncertainty Information: A Framework for Hydrogen Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10499851</link><description>Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) has emerged as a favored methodology for addressing the uncertainties stemming from renewable energy sources. However, existing DRO frameworks primarily focus on single types of uncertainty characteristics, such as moments. Exploring novel ambiguity sets that encompass heterogeneous uncertainty information to mitigate decision conservatism is thus an essential and strategic move. This paper introduces a day-ahead optimal scheduling model tailored for electricity-hydrogen systems under renewable uncertainty, with embedded technologies of hydrogen production, storage, and utilization. Three novel ambiguity sets enriched with the moment, Wasserstein distance, and unimodality information are adeptly devised. Building upon these elaborated ambiguity sets, we develop efficient and scalable reformulations of the expected objective function and uncertain constraints, leading to either a tractable mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem or a linear programming problem. We validate the effectiveness and operating flexibility of the proposed electricity-hydrogen model using both a 6-bus test system and the IEEE 118-bus test system. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superior cost performance and computational efficiency of our developed DRO approaches.</description></item><item><title>Spatial-Temporal Wind Power Probabilistic Forecasting Based on Time-Aware Graph Convolutional Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10502289</link><description>Spatial-temporal wind power prediction is of enormous importance to the grid-connected operation of multiple wind farms in the wind power system. However, most of the conventional methods are usually limited to predicting an individual wind farm's power, and thus lack enough effectiveness of wind power forecasting of multiple adjacent wind farms. This paper proposes a novel spatial-temporal wind power probabilistic prediction approach, named ZF-GCN-MHTQF, based on time zigzags and flexible convolution at graph convolutional network, point-wise loss function and the heavy-tailed quantile function. The proposed framework combines the advantages of time zigzags and flexible convolution at graph convolutional networks that can extract temporally conditioned topological information from multiple wind farms efficiently and incorporate the extracted topological information to predict wind power. At the same time, the proposed method incorporates the strengths of point-wise loss functions and heavy-tailed quantile functions which can effectively tackle the problem of the traditional multi-quantile regression and accurately capture the full conditional distribution information of wind power. In our experiments, two real-world wind power datasets from Australia are utilized to validate the proposed model. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art spatial-temporal models.</description></item><item><title>Robust Learning-Based Model Predictive Control for Wave Energy Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504609</link><description>This paper proposes a robust learning-based model predictive control (MPC) strategy tailored for sea wave energy converters (WECs). The control algorithm aims to maximize power extraction efficiency and maintain the WECs' operational safety over a wide range of sea conditions, subject to system constraints and plant-model mismatches. The theoretical basis is the robust tube-based MPC (RTMPC), enabling WEC system state trajectories to evolve around the noise-free nominal WEC model state trajectories. The disturbances can be bounded by pre-computed uncertainty sets for tightening the WEC's physical constraints to guarantee the constraint satisfaction of an uncertain WEC system. Typically, RTMPC constructs a tube with constant sets of uncertainties, which is likely to be overly conservative and hence potentially degrades energy conversion performance. In this work, a machine learning-based uncertainty set is introduced to dynamically predict and quantify the model uncertainties at each sampling instant, which can effectively enlarge the feasible region of the WEC TMPC control problem. The proposed RTMPC not only ensures improved energy conversion efficiency but also guarantees the operational safety of WECs under uncertain conditions. Numerical simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed controller.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Forecasting of Large Distributed Solar PV Fleets Using Sparse Smart Inverter Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504585</link><description>Ultra-short-term power forecasting for distributed solar photovoltaic (PV) generation is a largely unaddressed, highly challenging problem due to the prohibitive real-time data collection and processing requirements for a sheer number of distributed PV units. In this paper, we propose an innovative idea of forecasting the power output of a large fleet of distributed PV units using limited real-time data of a sparsely selected set of PV units, referred to as pilot units. We develop a two-stage method to address this problem. In the planning stage, we use the K-medoids clustering algorithm to select pilot units for the installation of real-time remote monitoring infrastructure. In the operation stage, we devise a deep learning framework integrating Long Short-Term Memory, Graph Convolutional Network, Multilayer Perceptron to capture the spatio-temporal power generation patterns between pilot units and other units, and forecast the power outputs of all units in a large PV fleet using the real-time data from the few selected pilot units only. Case study results show that our proposed method outperforms all baseline methods in forecasting for power outputs of individual PV units as well as the whole PV fleet, and the forecasting time resolution is not dependent on that of weather data.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Coordination of Networked-Microgrids Toward Decentralized Operation: A Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10505017</link><description>Multiple individual microgrids can be integrated as a networked microgrid system for enhanced technical and economic performance. In this paper, a two-stage data-driven method is proposed to hierarchically coordinate individual microgrids towards decentralized operation in a networked microgrid (NMG) system. The first stage schedules active power outputs of micro-turbines and energy storage systems (ESSs) on an hourly basis for energy balancing and cost minimization, where ESSs are controlled by a local P/SoC droop scheme. In the second stage, the reactive power outputs of PV inverters are dispatched every three minutes based on a Q/V droop controller, aiming to reduce network power losses and regulate the voltage under real-time uncertainties. At offline training stage, a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning model is trained to learn an optimal coordination policy, enhanced by a safety model framework. For online application, the trained agent can work locally in a decentralized manner without information exchanges, and the safety model can also be applied to monitor and guide online actions for safety compliance. Numerical test results validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Temperature-Dependent Resistance Constrained PV Accommodation Capacity Improvement Based on Multi-Objective DRL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508485</link><description>Against the backdrop of the low-carbon energy transition, distribution system operators face the urgent challenge of balancing the contradictory demands of high photovoltaic (PV) accommodation capacity and low operation cost. Meanwhile, most iteration-based PV accommodation capacity improvement methods are limited by imprecise line resistance and the conflicting relationship between decision efficiency and modeling accuracy. To this end, a two-timescale distribution network dispatching approach based on muti-objective DRL is proposed. This approach is an online decision-making method based on real-time data and robust to temperature-dependent resistance via constructing a two-stage decision-making model based on multi-objective Markov decision process considering the weather factors. Also, the proposed model has a vectorized reward function to assess the trade-off between the economy and accommodation capacity for better operation. A novel multi-objective DRL (MODRL) algorithm based on the tchebycheff norm is proposed, which decomposes the proposed decision-making model into multiple sub-models for learning Pareto optimal policies. Comparative tests on the IEEE 33-bus system validate that the proposed method effectively acquires optimization strategies under varying user preferences to improve economic and PV accommodation capacity. The proposed algorithm obtains more diverse Pareto fronts and high-quality solutions than other state-of-the-art MODRLs.</description></item><item><title>Voltage Regulation Enhanced Hierarchical Coordinated Volt/Var and Volt/Watt Control for Active Distribution Networks With Soft Open Points</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508977</link><description>The integration of renewable energy sources (RESs) into active distribution networks (ADNs) is essential for reducing carbon emissions but often results in voltage fluctuations and violations. This paper proposes a hierarchical voltage control framework that effectively coordinates diverse controllable devices with various response times in an ADN. The framework comprises three stages: day-ahead scheduling of on-load tap changer (OLTC), intra-day optimization for droop slopes and references for droop controllers in Soft Open Points (SOPs) and distributed generators (DGs), and real-time local voltage regulation. Unlike existing approaches, the proposed approach analytically establishes voltage stability constraints and incorporates them into droop slope optimization for local controllers, mitigating voltage oscillation risks. Additionally, a novel deviation-aware optimization method is developed to calculate optimal voltage references. This method treats the deviations between fixed-point voltages and their references as uncertainties and accounts for their impacts on voltage security through chance-constrained programming. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving voltage regulation performance with guaranteed stability.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Power Forecasting of Wind Farm Cluster Based on Global Information Adaptive Perceptual Graph Convolution Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521869</link><description>At present, the installed capacity of wind power has increased significantly. Improving the power forecasting accuracy of Wind Farm Cluster (WFC) is of great significance to promote the consumption of renewable energy. How to effectively extract the complex spatio-temporal correlation between wind farms is the key to improve the power forecasting accuracy of WFC. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a short-term WFC power forecasting method based on global information adaptive perception graph convolution. Compared with the traditional static graph structure, this paper designs the construction method of multiple Characteristic Graph Structures (CGSs) according to the correlation between farms.

First, a novel equal energy incremental rate criterion (EEIRC) is derived, based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) condition, for optimally utilizing the rotor kinetic energy that can enhance the frequency regulation capability of DWTs. Next, considering the coupling characteristics of inverter-side frequency and the wind turbine motion, the necessary and sufficient condition is explored for DWTs to maintain mechanical and electrical coupling (MEC) stability as they respond to ADN frequency deviations.

Finally, comprehensive simulations are conducted on the modified IEEE 123-bus system with 100% local wind power generation to validate the effectiveness and superiorities of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Optimization and Stable Operation Control Strategy for Fractional Frequency Transmission System Based on Large Signal Stability Analysis</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10528906</link><description>Fractional frequency transmission systems perform well in offshore wind power transmission, yet analyzing the large signal stability of the whole system still remains a significant challenge. Particularly, the absence of optimized stable operation control strategy under large signal disturbances threatens the system's long-term reliability and stability. To tackle the issues, this paper develops the multiple T-S fuzzy model, incorporating equivalent models for offshore wind farms, M3C, and industrial frequency loads, and analyzes stability under large signal disturbances, considering coupling effects and interactions with different frequencies. Furthermore, to address the challenge of system inability to directly transition to a new steady-state point after encountering large signal disturbances, such as load transients, a multi-objective optimization method based on Normalized Boundary Intersection (NBI) is proposed. This method aims to solve the problem by determining one optimal intermediate transition point for the stable operation control strategy. By comprehensively considering stability margins and operational efficiency, the system adopts an optimal operational mode during transient processes to smoothly transition to the target operating point. Finally, simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of large signal stability analysis findings and the stable operation control strategies.</description></item><item><title>Development and Performance Analysis of Aquila Algorithm Optimized SPV Power Imputation and Forecasting Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10534859</link><description>Solar photovoltaic (SPV) generators play a vital role in the global pursuit of sustainable energy. However, the intermittent nature of SPV generators poses a challenge to power system planning. Accurate long-term SPV power forecasting is essential, but obtaining high-quality training dsecata for many years is cumbersome due to faults in sensors, communication, or databases, leading to missing values. This paper proposes an attention network (AN) for SPV power imputation to address missing historical data. In addition, the SPV power forecasting model using BDLSTM NN is proposed for forecasting the SPV power in the long-term horizon. During training, the weights and biases of the imputation and forecasting models are proposed to be optimized using the Aquila optimization algorithm (AOA). Training and testing results substantiate that the proposed imputation and forecasting models consistently attain superior accuracy with a reduction in training time regardless of the missing rates, climatic patterns, and seasons as compared to benchmark models.</description></item><item><title>Inertia Estimation for Microgrid Considering the Impact of Wind Conditions on Doubly-Fed Induction Generators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10534804</link><description>With wind power penetration increasing, it is crucial to accurately estimate the impact of wind power generation on grid inertia levels.

The simulation reveals that the wind speed affects the microgrid inertia response through the turbine speed control. The method can assess the risk of frequency issues and assist in the safe and stable operation of microgrids.</description></item><item><title>An Electrolyzer Model for Power System Operation Optimization Over Broad Temperature Range</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10463117</link><description>Electrolyzers are recognized as promising equipment to improve power systems' operation flexibility. However, existing electrolyzer models used in power system operation optimization are either nonconvex or inaccurate when operating over a broad temperature range. Hence, this letter proposes an enhanced feasible operational area of electrolyzer (EFOAE) model. The EFOAE model is the first model that is convex and accurate over a broad temperature range (0 $^{\circ }$C&#8211;80 $^{\circ }$C). Therefore, the EFOAE model is favorable for operation optimization of the power systems with high penetration of renewables. Besides, to reduce errors, this letter improves the current electrolyzer feasible operational area derivation method, and removes the infeasible part in EFOAE. Compared with existing narrow temperature range (60 $^{\circ }$C&#8211;80 $^{\circ }$C) electrolyzer models, using EFOAE may release greater flexibility for power systems' operation, thereby reducing costs by 4.6% and wind curtailment by 63% in case studies.</description></item><item><title>Droop Coefficient Design of Wind Turbine Considering Rotor Speed Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10483536</link><description>This letter provides the design rule of the droop coefficient for the power synchronization loop (PSL) based grid-forming wind turbine (WT) considering the transient rotor speed constraints. The dynamic model for PSL-based WT is established first, and it is shown that the larger the droop coefficient, the larger the steady-state rotor speed deviation is. Accordingly, the maximum droop coefficient for ensuring the existence of equilibrium is derived. Finally, with the proper scaling of the transient rotor dynamic equation, the conservative evaluation of the maximum droop coefficient is obtained to make sure the WT does not touch the lower limit of the rotor speed during disturbance.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Wind Turbines and HVDC Power Transmission Lines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531697</link><description>An innovative scheme for the direct integration of wind turbines into the existing High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission systems without the need for boost power converters and step-up transformers is presented in this article.

Uncontrolled state changes can occur if optimal microgrid restoration and dispatch algorithms, used for generating control commands for distributed energy resources, do not incorporate the behavior of automatic controllers of voltage regulation devices. Inaccurate demand forecasts may be encountered since post-outage demand of behind-the-meter net metered (NM) loads can vary significantly from their historical NM profiles. This paper proposes an optimization formulation which allows optimal control of voltage regulators and capacitor banks without remote control and communication capabilities. A generalized demand model for NM loads is proposed which incorporates the cold load pickup phenomenon and their time varying post-outage demand in accordance with the IEEE 1547 standard. The time dependent optimal control formulation and the NM demand model are integrated in a sequential microgrid restoration algorithm by linearization of the involved logic propositions. A detailed case study on the unbalanced IEEE 123-node test system in OpenDSS validates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Data-Driven Frequency Control in Networked Microgrids via Voltage Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10511276</link><description>In this paper, a distributed data-driven frequency control scheme is proposed for the off-grid networked microgrid system (NMG). In the proposed scheme, the frequency is regulated by coordinately adjusting the active power generation provided by controllable generators and the active power demand provided by voltage sensitive loads, where the active power consumption of voltage sensitive loads is specially modified by adjusting the load operating voltages via voltage regulation. The whole control problem is solved with the feedback-based gradient method. To achieve better scalability and privacy, the overall control scheme is implemented in a distributed manner by employing an approximated gradient that can be calculated by limited communication between neighboring MGs. To further enable the controller to adapt to real-time system conditions, the required system model is updated online via the partial least square method in a recursive manner, which renders the proposed controller model-free. Numerical simulations involving detailed nonlinear NMG models illustrate the key benefits of the proposed method, including (i) eliminating the need for an accurate offline system model, (ii) reducing the need of controllable generation, and (iii) being robust against communication delays.</description></item><item><title>A New Composite Control Strategy for Large-Signal Stabilization of Constant Power Loads in Islanded AC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10518170</link><description>Large operating range in an islanded AC microgrid feeding constant power loads (CPLs) will cause both the severe amplitude wave and harmonic distortion of the bus voltage. This paper proposes a new composite control strategy to realize the large-signal stabilization for an islanded AC microgrid feeding CPLs. Firstly, a three-phase inverter system feeding CPLs is constructed in a dq rotating coordinate form. Secondly, the nonlinear disturbance observer technique is introduced to accurately and simultaneously estimate the current of the CPLs and coupling interactions, serving as feed-forward compensations for the AC bus voltage controller. Then a composite strategy can be designed by executing a feedback domination procedure. For the issue of voltage regulation under the large variation of CPLs and control targets, the proposed control strategy exhibits three merits: large-signal stability, fast performance recovery ability and concise control form. The tuning process of the control parameters are illustrated in the simulation. The effectiveness and priority of the proposed strategy are demonstrated by abundant of hardware-in-loop (HIL) and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Weighted Gradient Descent Method With Adaptive Step Sizes for Energy Management of Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10530408</link><description>Economic dispatch problems for power systems become more challenging as the system sizes, types and data increase significantly. Facing these complex optimization problems, centralized optimization methods may fall short and appear inefficient. Conversely, distributed optimization methods seem to be a potential and powerful tool for dealing with these more complex problems. However, some widely-used distributed methods suffer from their low convergence rates. Therefore, in this paper, a faster distributed optimization method via gradient descent is proposed, where the weighted matrix and adaptive step sizes are the keys of our method. In the distributed gradient method, the weighted matrix is modified and constructed from the out-degrees and upper limits of the second derivatives of objective functions, which boosts gradients reaching consensus more quickly. Further, the adaptive step sizes are presented to overcome the low convergence rate caused by manual settings of step sizes, where the Hessian matrix are used iteratively to obtain the optimal step sizes, which cooperates with the weighted matrix for gradients to lead to a faster convergence rate. Next, two propositions and a theorem are proved to show the linear convergence feature of the proposed method, which guarantees the fast convergence of our method. Finally, the proposed method is applied to solve the economic dispatch problem that consists of economic and environmental objectives in microgrids. Simulation results show that the number of iterations of our method is only one third or even less than those of some widely used methods. Moreover, when solving economic dispatch problems, our method exhibits superior fault tolerance in comparison to centralized methods.</description></item><item><title>Fault Analysis and Voltage Support Strategy Through Equivalent Line Impedances for MMCs in AC/DC Hybrid Distribution Networks Under Asymmetrical Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10485271</link><description>Under asymmetrical fault, modular multilevel converters (MMCs) in AC/DC hybrid distribution network should limit fault currents and inject currents to support grid voltages. The effect of voltage support is related to the line impedances, hence, injecting active-reactive currents based on line impedance parameters is a valuable solution. However, there are some problems remained to be solved: 1) fault network is quite different with the pre-fault network, and equivalent model of fault network should be built accurately; 2) the optimal ratio of injected active-reactive currents  $(I_{\mathrm{d}} / I_{\mathrm{q}}$ ) based on the line impedances in equivalent model should be deduced; 3) impedance parameters in the model should be estimated. Thus, in this manuscript, fault analysis is described via symmetrical component method, and MMC-based interconnected sequence network (ISN) is proposed to illustrated the fault network with fault branch under the steady-state period of fault. Then voltage support strategy based on the equivalent line impedances of ISN model are put forward. Perturbation and observation algorithm is introduced to estimate these impedances. Finally, the proposed ISN model and the voltage support strategy are verified in MATLAB/Simulink.</description></item><item><title>Post-Disaster Robust Restoration Scheme for Distribution Network Considering Rerouting Process of Cyber System With 5G</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10492470</link><description>Due to global warming, the frequency of various extreme weather events is increasing worldwide, posing significant threats to the power system. As a substantial number of distributed energy resources (DERs) and other smart devices are integrated into the distribution system, traditional passive distribution systems are transforming into cyber-physical active distribution systems. Components in both the cyber network and the physical network may sustain damage following severe natural disasters. Therefore, this paper proposes a post-disaster restoration scheme for active distribution networks (ADNs) considering the coupling of cyber-physical systems. The innovation of this work lies in the full utilization of 5G networks, complemented by a novel rerouting process, which reconnects offline cyber devices after disasters. This approach substantially enhances the resilience of the cyber system, which in turn can effectively support the restoration process of the physical system. Furthermore, the uncertainty of DERs and the three-phase unbalanced characteristic of ADNs are taken into account. To reduce the computation complexity, linearization techniques are applied to nonlinear constraints, ultimately resulting in a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation based on a two-stage robust optimization model, which is solved by the column and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) algorithm. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model are verified on both a modified IEEE 33-node system and a modified IEEE 123-node system integrated with cyber networks.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Single-Ended Transient-Based Boundary Protection Scheme for 35 kV Active Distribution Networks Based on Capacitive Voltage Transformers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504853</link><description>When many distributed generators (DGs) are connected to active distribution networks (ADNs), the performance of conventional overcurrent protection can seriously deteriorate. In response, single-ended transient-based boundary protection is considered an effective scheme for improving relay performance in ADNs due to its independence from power supply properties and its ability to cover an entire protected feeder. However, this approach depends on the filtering effect of the line boundary. This paper finds that capacitive voltage transformers (CVTs), metal-oxide arresters (MOAs), and the stray capacitances of the other apparatuses can serve together as line boundaries at substations and switching stations, and their excellent high-frequency filtering characteristics can assist in boundary protection design. A protection criterion is constructed based on the differences in high-frequency spectral energy between the internal and external fault-generated traveling waves (TWs). Furthermore, a novel two-stage boundary protection scheme is formed by reasonably coordinating the operation sequence and the protection scope of the first- and second-stage boundary protection. Finally, based on the PSCAD platform, the effectiveness, sensitivity, and reliability of the proposed protection scheme are verified under different fault scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Dispatch for Integrated Energy System Considering Data-Driven Dynamic Energy Hubs and Thermal Dynamics of Pipeline Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10485199</link><description>The modeling of dynamics in energy devices and pipeline networks reflects the real states of multi-energy flows, which is significant for realizing accurate optimal dispatch of integrated energy system (IES). In this paper, an approach with data-driven dynamic energy hubs (DDEH) and thermal dynamics of pipeline networks (TDPN) is proposed to describe the energy dynamic response process of IES. Based on the efficiency characteristics of energy conversion and storage devices, data-driven deep neural network (DNN) is adopted to excavate input-output relationship of the variable efficiency devices, which helps establish DDEH in time domain. To address the problem of nonlinear introduced by DNN, the nonlinear activation function in DDEH is equivalently converted into mixed integer linear model. At the same time, the TDPN is developed by bilateral characteristic line method (BCLM), which quantifies the time delay and loss of pipeline networks. TDNP demonstrates the network transportation dynamics in optimal dispatch, and the virtual energy storage effect of pipeline networks are analyzed. Case study from a community IES verifies the proposed approach effectively improve dynamic modeling accuracy of devices and pipeline networks, and have superiority in providing precise, reasonable and highly efficient optimal dispatch scheme.</description></item><item><title>Privacy-Preserving Combined Heat and Power Dispatch Based on Information Masking Mechanism: A Decentralized Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504614</link><description>Combined heat and power dispatch (CHPD) has aroused widespread attention nowadays due to its great potentiality and cost-effectiveness for wind accommodation. However, the CHPD requires the joint operation of multiple energy agents, and the traditional dispatch scheme is inapplicable in engineering practice due to the demand for privacy preservation among energy agents. To tackle this issue, a privacy-preserving method based on the information masking (IM) mechanism is proposed, which converts the original CHPD problem into another masked CHPD problem by obscuring the privacy parameters of the electric power systems and district heating systems. Furthermore, considering the absence of a third party in practice, we develop an improved IM mechanism based on blockchain, enabling privacy preservation in a fully decentralized framework. Numerical simulations conducted across different cases testify the effectiveness of the proposed privacy-preserving method and tests based on an actual system in Jilin province demonstrate the feasibility of application in practice. The computational performance of the proposed method is validated as well.</description></item><item><title>Load Data Valuation in Multi-Energy Systems: An End-to-End Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508249</link><description>Accurate load forecasting serves as the foundation for the flexible operation of multi-energy systems (MES). Multi-energy loads are tightly coupled and exhibit significant uncertainties. Many works focus on enhancing forecasting accuracy by leveraging cross-sector information. However, data owners may not be motivated to share their data unless it leads to substantial benefits. Ensuring a reasonable data valuation can encourage them to share their data willingly. This paper presents an end-to-end framework to quantify multi-energy load data value by integrating forecasting and decision processes. To address optimization problems with integer variables, a two-stage end-to-end model solution is proposed. Moreover, a profit allocation strategy based on contribution to cost savings is investigated to encourage data sharing in MES. The experimental results demonstrate a significant decrease in operation costs, suggesting that the proposed valuation approach more effectively extracts the inherent data value than traditional methods. According to the proposed incentive mechanism, all sectors can benefit from data sharing by improving forecasting accuracy or receiving economic compensation.</description></item><item><title>Two-Step Diffusion Policy Deep Reinforcement Learning Method for Low-Carbon Multi-Energy Microgrid Energy Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10529228</link><description>Coordinately scheduling multi-energy in a power system has attracted great research attention because of the benefits like improved energy utilization efficiency, lower system cost and carbon emission. However, the uncertainties from renewable power generation, energy supply and demand sides make this task highly complex. To solve it, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm with a novel diffusion model-based policy is proposed to optimize the problem of energy management in a multi-energy microgrid (MEMG) system. Moreover, a two-step reward function is developed to improve the training performance. To lower the overall carbon footprint and economic costs, the carbon emission trading and green certificate trading market mechanisms are introduced in our system to guide the end-user&#8217;s energy behaviors. A piece-wise linear carbon price model is proposed to constrain the undesired behavior more strictly and further reduce carbon emissions. The superior performance of the proposed scheduling method is compared with several benchmark methods, i.e., three state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, based on real-world datasets. Numerous case studies including three IEEE standard test systems have illustrated its effectiveness in terms of carbon reduction and cost efficiency, acquiring better convergence speed and stability at the same time, all of which lead our method to a better energy management strategy.</description></item><item><title>Online Operation Optimization for Hydrogen-Based Building Energy Systems Under Uncertainties</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10529226</link><description>Hydrogen-based energy systems have attracted widespread attention due to their capabilities of promoting renewable penetration and cutting carbon emissions. In this article, we study an operation optimization problem of a hydrogen-based building energy system. Since there are multi-source uncertainties related to electricity price, hydrogen price, electrical load, thermal load, and renewable generation output, spatially and temporally coupled constraints associated with power balance, heat balance, and energy storage systems, and nonlinear constraints, it is difficult to solve the considered optimization problem. To deal with the above difficulties, this paper proposes a low-complexity online operation optimization algorithm. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze the algorithmic feasibility and performance guarantees. Extensive simulations verify that the proposed algorithm can achieve near-optimal performance and reduce operation cost by 2.81%-7.74% compared with five baselines, including model predictive control and deep reinforcement learning.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Agent Deep Constrained Q-Learning Method for Smart Building Energy Management Under Uncertainties</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10496495</link><description>Data-driven energy management with flexible appliances in smart buildings is a key towards power system operational intelligence. However, the low efficiency of existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods in terms of optimization and computational performance, caused by reward shaping, large neural networks, system-wide constraints and reward allocation of photovoltaic power generation, signifies the need for new system-specific DRL methods. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multi-agent deep constrained Q-learning method to obtain online optimal solutions for smart building energy management in presence of various uncertainties. The proposed method minimizes daily energy cost via real-time adjustment of flexible appliances, and addressing impacts of the uncertainties. A deep constrained Q-learning algorithm is developed to effectively avoid reward shaping. By adopting multi-layer perception to estimate thermodynamics and electric vehicle charging states, and developing appliance-specific logic, it is novel to calculate the joint safe action space of all appliances during the training process. A multi-agent approach is developed to address the system-wide constraints and the reward allocation, directly in the Q-update, where hyper-parameters of individual agents are tuned separately. Numerical simulation results verify the high efficiency of the proposed method in daily energy cost minimization and online energy management.</description></item><item><title>Under-Frequency Load Shedding for Power Reserve Management in Islanded Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508572</link><description>This paper introduces under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) schemes specially designed to fulfill the power reserve requirements in islanded microgrids (MGs), where only one grid-forming resource is available for frequency regulation. When the power consumption of the MG exceeds a pre-defined threshold, the MG frequency will be lowered to various setpoints, thereby triggering UFLS for different levels of load reduction. Three types of controllable devices are considered for executing UFLS: sectionalizers, smart meters, and controllable appliances. To avoid unnecessary UFLS activation, various time delay settings are analyzed, allowing short-lived power spikes caused by events like motor startups or cold-load pickups to be disregarded. We tested the proposed UFLS schemes on a modified IEEE 123-bus system on the OPAL-RT eMEGASIM platform. Simulation results verify the efficacy of the proposed approaches in restoring power reserves, maintaining phase power balance, and effectively handling short-lived power fluctuations. Furthermore, in comparison to sectionalizer-based UFLS, using smart meters or controllable loads for UFLS allows for a more accurate per-phase load shedding in a progressive manner. As a result, it leads to better balanced three-phase voltage and serves more loads.</description></item><item><title>Pareto-Optimized Thermal Control of Multi-Zone Buildings Using Limited Sensor Measurements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10530220</link><description>This paper presents a control-oriented building thermal model and optimization framework. Space heating is used as an illustrative example of a flexible building load, with temperature setpoints as a control input. The presented framework is applicable to practical building systems where measurements are limited by cost and installation burden. An Unscented Kalman Filter estimates parameters and disturbance inputs of a multi-zone thermal circuit. Forecast models of multiple exogenous input sources are created from disturbance proxies and estimated disturbance inputs. Zone-level controllers in the thermal circuit simulation estimate the heating system response based on forecasted exogenous thermal inputs and proposed temperature setpoint profiles. Genetic algorithm-based operations are used to find an approximate Pareto set, i.e., the best trade-offs in the objective space. The focus of this work is reducing energy usage from space heating, while maintaining or improving thermal comfort. The full framework is demonstrated using data collected from a university building. Results predict that the proposed method provides a lower energy consumption than the baseline strategy. The framework is implemented in practice in a model predictive control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Flexible Building Energy Management With Neural ODEs-Based Model Predictive Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10531060</link><description>The increasing renewable penetration leads to a great need for flexible resources to balance supply and demand. Building energy systems can provide considerable flexibility by optimally coordinating various appliances. However, the complex thermodynamics and insufficient data associated challenge the modeling and operation of building energy systems. To address this, this paper proposes a neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) based model predictive control (MPC) framework for building energy management. Flexibilities are explored from two aspects: building thermal capacity and energy equipment coordination. The former is modeled using neural ODEs due to its complexity, while the latter is modeled as an energy hub. Both models are integrated into MPC in a linear form. The neural ODEs model is designed to strike a balance between reliability and representational capability, as well as a balance between the accuracy of long- and short-term predictions. The proposed method is verified on a simulated multizone retail building. The results indicate that the proposed model has a higher accuracy than the traditional resistance&#8212;capacitance (RC) model and the neural network model in operation with efficient computational performance. The controlled building can respond to price signals while providing demand response resources, which may result in significant cost savings.</description></item><item><title>Online Learning for Robust Voltage Control Under Uncertain Grid Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10486962</link><description>Voltage control generally requires accurate information about the grid&#8217;s topology in order to guarantee network stability. However, accurate topology identification is challenging for existing methods, especially as the grid is subject to increasingly frequent reconfiguration due to the adoption of renewable energy. In this work, we combine a nested convex body chasing algorithm with a robust predictive controller to achieve provably finite-time convergence to safe voltage limits in the online setting where there is uncertainty in both the network topology as well as load and generation variations. In an online fashion, our algorithm narrows down the set of possible grid models that are consistent with observations and adjusts reactive power generation accordingly to keep voltages within desired safety limits. Our approach can also incorporate existing partial knowledge of the network to improve voltage control performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a case study on a Southern California Edison 56-bus distribution system. Our experiments show that in practical settings, the controller is indeed able to narrow the set of consistent topologies quickly enough to make control decisions that ensure stability in both linearized and realistic non-linear models of the distribution grid.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Two-Timescale Configuration of Mobile Edge Computing With Mixed Energy Supply</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504784</link><description>Powering mobile edge computing (MEC) with a hybrid supply of smart grid (SG) and renewable energy source (RES) offers an opportunity to utilize clean energy and cut down energy expenses under two-way energy transactions. We propose two-timescale online resource allocation and energy management (TSRE) for MEC with a hybrid power supply, adapting to dynamic task and RES arrivals, wireless channels, and energy prices. The TSRE minimizes the time-averaged cost of predictive energy planning and real-time energy trading of base stations (BSs), and the energy usage of mobile users. By generalizing the Lyapunov optimization and stochastic subgradient method, the energy planning (sub)problem is solved upon RES arrivals using only historical data. The real-time offloading schedules, energy trading decisions and CPU configurations are decoupled over time and (asymptotically) optimally made in a distributed manner. The feasibility and the asymptotic optimality of the TSRE are proved. Numerical results demonstrate that the TSRE saves system cost significantly by 33.7%, compared to its baselines.</description></item><item><title>Revenue Maximization for a Battery Storage With Optimal Capacity Revamping Due to Cyclic Fade</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10506242</link><description>An accurate approach for optimal revenue-stacking operation of battery storage assets should consider the degradation of their energy capacity as a result of cyclic charging/discharging operations.

However, scheduling massive HVACs is challenging due to computation complexity and the uncertainty of outdoor temperature. In this paper, we first introduce a novel continuous-time (CT) aggregation model to reveal the potential intra-hour flexibility of HVACs. For accurate aggregation, a new affine transformation is designed to handle the heterogeneity in high-dimensional feasible region. Further, for reliable aggregation in practical environment, the outdoor temperature uncertainty is constructed by distributionally robust chance constrains and integrated into the aggregation model. Secondly, for the tractable calculation of the proposed CT aggregation model, a cascade of tailored reformulation techniques is proposed, including the Bernstein polynomial spline, polytope projection, and linearization transformation. Thirdly, a customized hierarchical dispatch framework is proposed via incorporating the proposed CT aggregation model into reserve provision in power system dispatch, so as to efficiently schedule massive HVACs to cope with the renewable uncertainty. Case studies verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed CT aggregation model in aggregation accuracy, intra-hour flexibility utilization, and uncertainty handling.</description></item><item><title>Load Recognition With Few-Shot Transfer Learning Based on Meta-Learning and Relational Network in Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504869</link><description>Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) monitors the operating status and power consumption of residential appliances with only one main meter, providing a new measure for energy management. Deep learning (DL) shows outperformance in NILM. However, the lack of appliance data caused by rapid growth appliance types and high-cost data sampling reduces the DL-based load recognition accuracy. Transfer learning (TL) enables DL-based model generalization. However, the generalization would be limited when data in the target domain are insufficient. Therefore, a non-intrusive load recognizing (NILR) few-shot TL based on meta-learning and relational network is proposed to improve the load recognition generalization performance, named MRNILR-TL. First, the method constructs an episode task dataset by task sampling to provide diverse learnable tasks for few-shot load recognition training. Afterward, a multi-classification load recognition model based on meta-learning and relational network is constructed, and a meta-learning based relational network enhances the ability to learn the laws of similarity among appliance features from few-shot data. Finally, achieving the few-shot multi-classification load recognition generalization by directly transferring the source task knowledge and strategies to the target task. Experimental results in four transfer scenes demonstrate the proposed method achieves generalization and outperforms most existing NILM TL methods.</description></item><item><title>A Distributionally Robust Model Predictive Control for Static and Dynamic Uncertainties in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10486942</link><description>The integration of various power sources, including renewables and electric vehicles, into smart grids is expanding, introducing uncertainties that can result in issues like voltage imbalances, load fluctuations, and power losses. These challenges negatively impact the reliability and stability of online scheduling in smart grids. Existing research often addresses uncertainties affecting current states but overlooks those that impact future states, such as the unpredictable charging patterns of electric vehicles. To distinguish between these, we term them static uncertainties and dynamic uncertainties, respectively. This paper introduces WDR-MPC, a novel approach that stands for two-stage Wasserstein-based Distributionally Robust (WDR) optimization within a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, aimed at effectively managing both types of uncertainties in smart grids. The dynamic uncertainties are first reformulated into ambiguity tubes and then the distributionally robust bounds of both dynamic and static uncertainties can be established using WDR optimization. By employing ambiguity tubes and WDR optimization, the stochastic MPC system is converted into a nominal one. Moreover, we develop a convex reformulation method to speed up WDR computation during the two-stage optimization. The distinctive contribution of this paper lies in its holistic approach to both static and dynamic uncertainties in smart grids. Comprehensive experiment results on IEEE 38-bus and 94-bus systems reveal the method&#8217;s superior performance and the potential to enhance grid stability and reliability.</description></item><item><title>A Reliable Evaluation Metric for Electrical Load Forecasts in V2G Scheduling Considering Statistical Features of EV Charging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508231</link><description>An accurate electrical load forecast is essential for the effective implementation of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology to achieve optimal electric vehicle (EV) charging decisions, consequently, ensuring the security and stability of power grid. While prevailing evaluation metrics prioritize forecast quality, they often overlook the significant influence a forecast exerts when integrated into the V2G scheduling optimization. In this paper, a reliable metric is proposed for forecasts in the context of V2G scheduling from the perspective of forecast value. Firstly, we conducted meticulously designed experiments to expose the limitations of forecast quality metrics in the context of V2G scheduling, as well as reveal three key findings. Subsequently, to address computational challenges and enhance representativeness of scheduling results, statistical features of EV charging are used to construct the aggregate model of EV fleet. Then, a reliable metric called V2G scheduling value error (V2G-SVE) is proposed to evaluate the degradation rate of scheduling performance as the score for forecasting performance. Finally, extensive case studies provide compelling evidence for the effectiveness and broad applicability of V2G-SVE. Beyond proposing an evaluation metric, this paper also aims to provide valuable insights about potential direction of improvement for future load forecasting technology.</description></item><item><title>Factoring Electrochemical and Full-Lifecycle Aging Modes of Battery Participating in Energy and Transportation Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10533267</link><description>As the world transitions towards sustainable alternatives, transportation electrification emerges as a pivotal strategy within deep decarbonization initiatives undertaken by governments globally.

The pressing need to understand and mitigate the costs and implications of battery aging forms the crux of this research. This paper aims to improve the lifecycle economy of EVs participating in energy and transportation systems by factoring in the electrochemical aging modes of the battery. In the first stage, battery electrochemical aging features are modeled by learning cell fading rate under different healthy states from the Stanford experimental dataset. Then, by comprehensively quantifying the impact of depth of discharge, C-rate, state of health, and state of charge, this paper establishes a full lifecycle degradation model to model battery aging under different working conditions and aging stages. In the second stage, battery electrochemical aging features are further integrated into vehicle energy management to realize the effective utilization of BESS in energy and transportation systems. With the proposed energy management scheme, vehicle batteries with different electrochemical aging stages can be flexibly utilized under full lifecycles. The effectiveness of the proposed methodologies is verified under the cases of EVs participating in energy and transportation systems. Results in this paper validate the necessity of factoring battery electrochemical aging features in BESS management and provide a new perspective for further improving the total economy of transportation electrification.</description></item><item><title>AdaptEdge: Targeted Universal Adversarial Attacks on Time Series Data in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10488456</link><description>Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a key technique in smart grid operations for task classification of power quality disturbances (PQDs) nomenclature PQDsPower Quality Disturbances. Even though these models have considerably improved the efficiency of power infrastructure, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks presents potential difficulties. For the first time, we introduce a novel algorithm called Adaptive Edge (AdaptEdge), nomenclature AdaptEdgeAdaptive Edge which effectively employs targeted universal adversarial attack to deceive DL models working with time series data. The unique contribution of this algorithm is its ability to maintain a delicate balance between the fooling rate and the imperceptibility of perturbations to human observers. Our results demonstrate a fooling rate of up to 90.78% in the ResNet50 model&#8212;the highest achieved thus far&#8212;while maintaining an optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) nomenclature SNRSignal-to-Noise Ratio of 3dB and ensuring signal integrity. We implemented our algorithm across various advanced DL models and found considerable efficacy, demonstrating its adaptability and versatility across diverse architectures. The results of our study highlight the pressing need for developing more robust DL model implementations in the context of the smart grid. Additionally, our proposed approach demonstrates its effectiveness in addressing this need.</description></item><item><title>Locational Detection of False Data Injection Attacks in the Edge Space via Hodge Graph Neural Network for Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10502207</link><description>Recently, the emerging False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs), one of the major cybersecurity threats, have been severely threatening smart grids, since FDIAs could bypass conventional bad data detectors to disrupt power system operations. To maintain the security of power systems, it is critical to develop efficient locational detectors for FDIAs. However, designing FDIA detectors that could model the inherent underlying graph structures of smart grids and spatially correlated measurement data residing on both branches and buses such that FDIAs in the edge space could be detected and located, remains an open problem. In this work, we propose an alternative graph representation for smart grids, regarding both the power flows on branches and power injections on buses, such that we could simultaneously process these data in the edge space. We propose a Hodge Aggregation Graph Neural Network (AGNN)-based FDIA detector, leveraging the Hodge theory and exploiting the Hodge Laplacian into the AGNN. We further develop a Hodge Aggregation Graph Attention Network (AGAT)-based FDIA detector to enhance the locational detection performance of the Hodge AGNN-based detector, by utilizing the graph attention mechanism. Illustrative simulation results demonstrate the superior locational detection performance of the proposed detectors, compared to the other state-of-the-art FDIA detectors.</description></item><item><title>Homomorphic Encryption-Based Resilient Distributed Energy Management Under Cyber-Attack of Micro-Grid With Event-Triggered Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504611</link><description>Privacy disclosures and malevolent data intrusions targeting adversarial agents pose significant menaces to cyber-physical systems, a reality that extends to the intricate realm of micro-grid energy management. This paper proposes a homomorphic encryption based resilient distributed algorithm with an event-triggered mechanism to address this problem. Due to the potential information disclosure issue, exchange information is encrypted to an arbitrary neighbor and decrypted with a private key to protect agents. Considering the potential security attacks on adversary agents, an event-trigger based resilient distributed optimization with trusted agents (ETRDO-T) is proposed. It ensures the convergence of distributed algorithms, as well as relives the communication burden caused by homomorphic encryption. The simulation results, it can be seen that even under data attacks from malicious nodes, this method can effectively protect privacy information in information exchange while ensuring the convergence of energy management.</description></item><item><title>Phase Shifting Transformer-Based Mitigation Strategy for Load Redistribution Attacks in Power System Optimal Power Flow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10504593</link><description>As one of the most threatening cyber-attacks, load redistribution (LR) attacks can stealthily misguide the operation of power system by exploiting the vulnerabilities of power information systems. Even though various defending methods have been studied, it is still challenging to mitigate the damaging impact of LR attacks. In this paper, we propose a phase shifting transformers (PST) based mitigation method utilizing the widely deployed PST devices in optimal power flow (OPF), which can further improve the performance of existing mitigation methods. Specifically, a tri-level optimization is formulated and solved by the column and constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) decomposition method in the PST-based mitigation method, which gives the optimal set of PSTs for phase angle adjustment. Since a large amount of binary variables are introduced in the C&amp;amp;CG method, an approximate solution method of the tri-level optimization is presented to reduce computing burden without significantly affecting the optimality in large power systems. Simulations in the PJM 5-bus, IEEE 14-bus, IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems verify the effectiveness and applicability of the PST-based mitigation method.</description></item><item><title>Experimental Cybersecurity Evaluation of Distributed Solar Inverters: Vulnerabilities and Impacts on the Australian Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10508264</link><description>The increasing adoption of solar power globally presents an environmentally sustainable alternative to traditional energy sources. However, integrating solar distributed generation (DG) systems into the power grid introduces complexities that can impact the grid&#8217;s reliability and security. While information and communication technologies have significantly improved the management and control of solar DG systems, they concurrently introduce new cybersecurity vulnerabilities. This study explores the security and stability challenges introduced by solar DG systems, with a specific focus on the vulnerabilities in commercial solar inverters. Additionally, it assesses the operational and economic consequences of cybersecurity incidents directed at commercial solar inverters within the energy sector, with a particular emphasis on the Australian grid. Given the vulnerabilities and potential impacts identified, the paper proposes recommendations to enhance the cybersecurity posture of solar DG systems. The primary aim of this article is to enrich the understanding and mitigation strategies for cybersecurity risks associated with solar inverters, thereby ensuring the power grid&#8217;s reliable and secure operation.

LFC utilizes communication channels to generate control signals, thus it is potentially vulnerable to cyber-attacks and faults. This work considers a cyber-physical model for LFC in which the adversary compromises the resources of the cyber layer to inject a stealthy false data injection attack (FDIA) vector. The FDIA injects the best-effort stealthy error into the data collected by the LFC, corrupting the control center&#8217;s calculations and leading to incorrect control signals. To effectively manage this complex decision-making scenario, a game theory-based framework is established to analyze the interaction between the controller and the attacker. Based on the model, an FDIA defense mechanism based on a bi-level differential game is proposed. The experiments conducted on a three-region interconnected power system based on the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate that the proposed strategy can effectively maintain the stability of the frequency and inter-regional power deviation within acceptable limits, even in the presence of FDIAs.</description></item><item><title>Transferability-Oriented Adversarial Robust Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521912</link><description>Security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) aims to achieve an economical operation while considering the security issues during contingencies. Data-driven security assessment methods can provide security constraints for SCOPF and have been widely developed in the smart grid community to deal with the challenges arising from the increased penetration of renewable energy resources and the deployment of power electronic devices. Nevertheless, it has been recognized that the machine learning model is vulnerable to adversarial examples, and the power system communication network is prone to cyber attacks, which affects the decision-making of security assessment and SCOPF. To this end, a transferability-oriented adversarial robust security-constrained optimal power flow (TOAR-SCOPF) is proposed to diminish the potential security risks from attacks, formulated as an attacker-defender problem. To alleviate the conservatism of TOAR-SCOPF, a more realistic scenario with unknown features and unknown selected machine learning models is considered in this work by developing a novel transferability-oriented adversarial attack (TOA) method for data-driven security assessment while considering the power system&#8217;s physical constraints to bypass the bad data detection mechanism. Case studies are conducted based on the IEEE 39-bus and IEEE 68-bus systems, respectively, to explore the vulnerability and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOAR-SCOPF.</description></item><item><title>Voltage Calculations in Secondary Distribution Networks via Physics-Inspired Neural Network Using Smart Meter Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10517953</link><description>The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) leads to voltage issues across distribution networks, necessitating voltage calculations by utilities. Electric model-free voltage calculation offers an enticing solution. However, most researches mainly focus on primary distribution networks ignoring secondary distribution networks and commonly overlook extreme voltage case calculations, which require the model&#8217;s extrapolation abilities. In addressing the gaps, this paper presents a customized physics-inspired neural network (PINN) model, the structure of which is inspired by the derived coupled power flow model of primary-secondary distribution networks. To ensure precision and rapid convergence, a crafted training framework for the PINN model is proposed. The PINN&#8217;s &#8220;structure-mimetic&#8221; design enables superior extrapolation for unseen scenarios and enhances physical information awareness. We demonstrate this through two applications: hosting capacity analysis and customer-transformer connectivity. The effectiveness and advantages of the proposed PINN model are validated on two public testing systems and one utility distribution feeder model.</description></item><item><title>Modularized Bilinear Koopman Operator for Modeling and Predicting Transients of Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10527356</link><description>Modularized Koopman bilinear form (M-KBF) is presented to model and predict the transient dynamics of microgrids in the presence of disturbances. As a scalable data-driven approach, M-KBF divides the identification and prediction of the high-dimensional nonlinear system into the individual study of subsystems, and thus, alleviates the difficulty of intensively handling high volume data and overcomes the curse of dimensionality. For each subsystem, Koopman bilinear form is established to efficiently identify its model by identifying isotypic eigenfunctions via the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) method with an eigenvalue-based order truncation. Extensive tests show that M-KBF can provide accurate transient dynamics prediction for the nonlinear microgrids and verify the plug-and-play modeling and prediction function, which offers a potent tool for identifying high-dimensional systems with reconfiguration feature. The modularity feature of M-KBF enables the provision of fast and precise prediction for the power grid operation and control, paving the way towards online applications.</description></item><item><title>A Generic Transient-Performance-Improved Framework for Privacy-Preserving Distributed Microgrid Controls</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10539270</link><description>Existing studies about the privacy-preserving distributed (PP-Di) controls of islanded AC microgrid (MG) rely on adding the decaying disturbance into communications, such as correlated decaying noise and exponentially decaying disturbance. However, it will degrade transient performance of islanded AC MG, such as frequency and power overshoot. In this letter, a generic transient-performance-improved framework is proposed to coordinate these PP-Di controls for this problem. This framework only requires adding two first-order observer-based dynamics to adjust the control gain in transient process. Real-time simulation platform based on NI-PXI is built to validate its advantages.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Satellite-Terrestrial Network Framework for Next Generation Smart Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10587036</link><description>Satellite Internet as a representative of 6G offers a globally resilient service of communication, navigation, timing and remote sensing at multiple temporal and spatial scales. Facing the 6G era, the next generation smart grid (NGSG) will be constructed with the assistance of a unified space-ground network. This accounts for the unified network&#8217;s attributions of wide coverage, large base of sources and loads, and the complex environment. Hence, an integrated satellite-terrestrial network (ISTN) framework is proposed in this letter. It aims at empowering the NGSG under the massive renewable energy sources integration, which includes conditions of an intelligent urban grid, a reliable remote area grid, and a resilient grid to emergency. Heterogeneous data such as remote sensing and navigation signals are aggregated and leveraged in the proposed ISTN framework. Information entropy theory is used to coordinate the space- and ground-based networks elaborately, maximizing the utilization of network resources pointedly and efficiently. A cyber-physical platform is used based on an actual LEO satellite Internet test constellation to validate the proposed ISTN, which reveals the superiority and promising future.</description></item><item><title>Enabling Reliable Water&#8211;Air Direct Optical Wireless Communication for Uncrewed Vehicular Networks: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10468635</link><description>The next generation wireless networks demand full coverage from the sky to the deep ocean, in which the water-air cross-boundary communication is a critical component in a coordinated uncrewed vehicular network that connects both uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In such a network, optical wireless communication (OWC) is an emerging and promising technology to implement direct high-speed wireless communication through the water-to-air interface. However, due to the high directionality of optical beams and the dynamics of the harsh oceanic environments, it faces significant challenges to achieve reliable and robust seamless cross-boundary communication, as the waves cause beam deflection and the mobility of the transceivers makes the link worse or even results in link disconnections. To deal with these challenges, in this paper, we investigate both static and mobile application scenarios to enable reliable water-air direct optical communications via the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches. In the static scenario, we propose an active alignment method and derive the optimal beamwidth to satisfy the requirement of bit error rate (BER) and improve the link availability. To cope with the oceanic environment-induced channel dynamics, in the mobile scenario, we design a DRL-based UAV control strategy by incorporating the extended Kalman filter (EKF) prediction technique to enhance reliable communication between the mobile transceivers. The numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed schemes achieve impressive performance in terms of energy consumption and reliable communications under both the static and mobile scenarios.</description></item><item><title>RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems With Channel Aging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10468556</link><description>Cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) are two disruptive technologies for enabling the sixth-generation network. In this paper, we investigate the effect of channel aging on the RIS-aided CF massive MIMO systems over spatially correlated channels. We consider a minimum mean square error channel estimator that facilitates the derivation of closed-form spectral efficiency expressions. For the uplink, we compare the large-scale fading decoding method with the centralized decoding method. For the downlink, we adopt the maximum ratio precoding and propose a practical fractional power control method to improve the performance. Based on the analytical framework, we unveil the interplay between channel aging, spatial correlation, and signal processing methods. Our results demonstrate that the RIS-aided CF massive MIMO system outperforms the conventional CF counterpart system in both static and mobile scenarios. Moreover, when the link is weak, the introduction of RIS can lead to even more substantial performance enhancement. Also, RIS can be deployed to compensate for system performance degradation caused by channel aging and potentially lead to energy savings, while still achieving excellent performance. Intriguingly, due to the mutual coupling of RIS element and AP antenna correlations, RIS can effectively mitigate the negative effects caused by spatial correlation among AP antennas. Furthermore, we provide a practical rule-of-thumb guideline for designing resource block length, accounting for the impacts caused by channel aging.</description></item><item><title>Goal-Oriented Transmission Scheduling for Energy-Efficient Wireless Networked Control in SAGIN: An AoI-Thresholding Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10473131</link><description>Addressing the goal-oriented design for mission-critical services like remote control, stands as a pivotal challenge in the space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN). This paper investigates an energy-efficient wireless networked control system with local and remote controllers in SAGIN. Frequent state transmission from sensor to remote controller would improve the quality of control (QoC) at the expense of nontrivial energy consumption. Nevertheless, such a tradeoff for the considered system has received little attention. In this sense, we propose a goal-oriented transmission scheduling design to balance QoC and energy consumption. In particular, we formulate an optimization problem on minimizing the weighted sum of control cost and power consumption by making decisions about whether to transmit the state or not. By formulating a Markov Decision Process framework, the optimal transmission scheduling policy is proven to have a threshold structure tied to the age of information (AoI). Then, the optimal AoI threshold is obtained by means of a discrete-time Markov chain. Equipped with this, we propose an AoI-thresholding mechanism that can provide insights into when to transmit the state in a computationally-efficient manner. Numerical results shed light on the advantages of the proposed policy over the periodical and greedy transmission policies for the considered system.</description></item><item><title>Message Passing-Based Joint Channel Estimation and Signal Detection for OTFS With Superimposed Pilots</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475591</link><description>Receivers with joint channel estimation (CE) and signal detection using superimposed pilots (SP) can achieve high transmission efficiency in orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) systems. However, existing receivers have high computational complexity, hindering their practical applications. In this work, with SP in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain and the generalized complex exponential (GCE) basis expansion modeling (BEM) for channels, a message passing-based SP-DD iterative receiver is proposed, which drastically reduces the computational complexity while with marginal performance loss, compared to existing ones. To facilitate CE in the proposed receiver, we design pilot signal to achieve pilot power concentration in the frequency domain, thereby developing an SP-DD-D receiver that can reduce the power of the pilot signal with almost no loss of CE and bit error rate (BER) performance. Extensive simulation results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed SP-DD-D receiver.</description></item><item><title>Enhancement of Direct LEO Satellite-to-Smartphone Communications by Distributed Beamforming</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475582</link><description>The Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite network is undergoing rapid development with the maturing of satellite communications and rocket launch technologies, and the demand for a global coverage network. However, current satellite communication networks are constrained by limited transmitting signal power, resulting in the use of large-size and energy-consuming ground terminals to provide additional gain. This paper proposes a novel technology called distributed beamforming to address such challenges and support direct communications from LEO satellites to smartphones. The proposed distributed beamforming technique is based on the superposition of Electromagnetic (EM) waves and aims to enhance the received signal strength. Furthermore, we utilize EM wave superposition to increase the link budget and provide the coverage pattern formed by the distributed antenna array, which will be affected by the array structure and the transmitter parameters. In addition, the impact of Doppler frequency shift and time misalignment on the performance of distributed beamforming is investigated. Numerical results show that the enhancement of the received power depends on the angle formed by those radiated beams and can be up to the square of the number of beams; namely, a maximum enhancement of 6 dB could be obtained by using two satellites and a maximum of 12 dB increase through four satellites, which provide a clear guideline for the design of distributed beamforming for future satellite communications.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Federated Learning via Joint Communication and Computation Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10476747</link><description>Federated learning (FL) is a promising distributed framework that a server leverages a large number of clients to collaboratively learn a model while keeping the privacy of their local data. However, the heterogeneity of computation and communication resources among clients, which maybe lead to the different time arriving at the server, has a negative effect on the convergence of FL algorithms because the stragglers heavily slow down the runtime. In this paper, we develop a joint optimization model of client central processing unit (CPU) frequency, channel assignment, power allocation and local model accuracy based on a designated global model accuracy to minimize the maximum delay of communication and computation of all participating clients. Unfortunately, this problem is a non-convex mixed-integer programming, which is NP-hard. Thus, an equivalent problem by transforming discrete variables into continuous ones is first developed in order to make the original problem tractable. Then we propose a novel Alternating Momentum Gradient Descent with Variable Similarity (AMGDVS) algorithm to solve the min-max problem, which incorporates a similarity index into the previous partial gradients so as to consider the interaction of variables. The proposed AMGDVS algorithm converges to the first-order stationary point with the accuracy factor being $\eta$ within $\mathcal {O}(\eta ^{-4})$ iterations. Our simulations, conducted under various parameter settings, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the average training time for learning an FL model on FMNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, both in the Independent Identically Distributed (IID) and Non-Independent Identically Distributed (Non-IID) scenarios, is noticeably reduced.</description></item><item><title>Joint Power and Pilot Length Allocation for Ultra-Reliable and High-Throughput Transmission</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10484984</link><description>Emerging services in Tactile Internet are expected to bring immersive experience for customers in watching live sports, action films, and advertisements, which demand ultra-reliable and high-throughput transmission. Since the power budget and the block length are limited for communications, allocating the transmit power and the pilot length becomes critical for efficient data transmission from the base station (BS) to the devices. In this work, taking the coding theory of finite blocklength and the resource allocation over channel estimation and data transmission into account, both data error probability and throughput are analyzed and optimized in terms of the pilot power and pilot length, respectively. It is revealed that both the data error probability and the throughput are quasiconcave and quasiconvex, respectively, with respect to ($w.r.t.$) the pilot length and the power of pilot signal from a block-level perspective. Regarding a frame consisting of multiple blocks, we propose the truncated channel inversion scheme to allocate the data transmission power over multiple blocks. Given the length of pilots, the average data error probability and the average throughput for a frame are proved to be quasiconcave and quasiconvex, respectively, $w.r.t.$ the desired power level of the received data signal. We propose a sub-optimal algorithm for frame-wise throughput maximization to derive the length of the pilots and the desired power level of the received data signal. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the fixed transmission power scheme in terms of the average data error probability for a frame by reducing an order of magnitude under the same system power constraints.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid RFF Identification for LTE Using Wavelet Coefficient Graph and Differential Spectrum</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10487783</link><description>The growing popularity of 4 G/5 G mobile devices has led to an increase in demand for wireless security. Radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) technique is an emerging approach for device authentication using intrinsic and unique hardware impairments. In this paper, we propose an RFF-based method to identify rogue/unknown long term evolution (LTE) terminals. This is achieved by combining wavelet transform (WT) coefficient graphs and differential spectrum. The proposed method involves extracting 48 levels of wavelet coefficients from the transient power-off of the physical random access channel (PRACH) signal and representing them in a WT graph. The steady-state part of the PRACH signal after a frequency domain differential processing between the adjacent spectrum is extracted. To detect unknown attack devices, an identification scheme based on an autoencoder (AE) is designed. Two different AE network structures are designed based on the proposed features, and a hybrid identification structure is proposed. An experimental evaluation system is set up with seven mobile phones from three categories and one universal software radio peripheral (USRP) software-defined radio (SDR) platform. Training and testing datasets are collected under different conditions such as location, working times, and dates. Experimental results show that rogue devices can be identified with an accuracy up to 98.84% for different categories and 90.27% for different individuals.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Task Deep Reinforcement Learning for Terahertz NOMA Resource Allocation With Hybrid Discrete and Continuous Actions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480465</link><description>Terahertz (THz) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks have great potential for next-generation wireless communications, by providing promising ultra-high data rates and user fairness. In THz-NOMA networks, efficient and effective long-term beamforming-bandwidth-power (BBP) allocation is yet an open problem due to its non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard) nature. In this article, the continuous property of power and sub-arrays ratios assignment and the discrete property of sub-bands allocation are carefully treated. In light of these attributes, an offline hybrid discrete and continuous actions (DISCO) multi-task deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed to maximize the long-term throughput. Specifically, the deployment of multi-task learning enables the actor of DISCO to smartly integrate two state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, e.g., actor-critic (AC) that only selects discrete actions and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) that only generates continuous actions. Rigorous theoretical derivations for the neural network design and backpropagation process are provided to tailor our proposed DISCO for the BBP problem. Compared to the benchmark no-learning and conventional DRL algorithms, DISCO enhances the network throughput, while achieving good fairness among users. Furthermore, DISCO consumes hundred-of-millisecond computational time, revealing the practicability of DISCO.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Based One-Bit Maximum Likelihood Detection for Massive MIMO Systems: Dithering-Aided Adaptive Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480278</link><description>In this paper, we propose a learning-based detection framework for uplink massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems with one-bit analog-to-digital converters. The learning-based detection only requires counting the occurrences of the quantized outputs of $+1$ and $-1$ for estimating a likelihood probability at each antenna. Accordingly, the key advantage of this approach is to perform maximum likelihood detection without explicit channel estimation which has been one of the primary challenges of one-bit quantized systems. However, due to the quasi-deterministic reception in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, one-bit observations in the high SNR regime are biased to either $+1$ or $-1$, and thus, the learning requires excessive training to estimate the small likelihood probabilities. To address this drawback, we propose a dither-and-learning technique to estimate likelihood functions from dithered signals. First, we add a dithering signal to artificially decrease the SNR and then infer the likelihood function from the quantized dithered signals by using an SNR estimate derived from a deep neural network-based estimator which is trained offline. We extend our technique by developing an adaptive dither-and-learning method that updates the dithering power according to the patterns observed in the quantized dithered signals. The proposed framework is also applied to channel-coded MIMO systems by computing a bit-wise and user-wise log-likelihood ratio from the refined likelihood probabilities. Simulation results validate the performance of the proposed methods in both uncoded and coded systems.</description></item><item><title>Effective Joint Scheduling and Power Allocation for URLLC-Oriented V2I Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480268</link><description>Future vehicular applications, such as safety guarantee and autonomous driving, rely on vehicular-to-infrastructure (V2I) ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). This paper investigates the flow scheduling and power allocation mechanism to improve the transmission capacity of the downlink V2I orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) URLLC network. Given the stringent latency requirements, short package transmission is adopted and the approximation of the finite blocklength codes capacity is introduced for the algorithm design. Also in the system design, we fully consider the effect of Doppler spread caused by high vehicular mobility. We formulate the problem of maximizing the number of flows that satisfy delay and reliability requirements while meeting the constrained radio and power resources. To solve this challenging non-convex problem, we propose a joint optimization framework for flow scheduling and power allocation. In the scheduling phase, we propose a deferred acceptance based flow scheduling algorithm by leveraging matching game. In the power allocation phase, we design a collection-reallocation algorithm for local power optimization while fully considering the dynamic characteristics of V2I scenarios. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme effectively enhances the system performance compared to other state-of-art mechanisms.</description></item><item><title>STAR-RIS Assisted Offloading Based on Hybrid NOMA: A Time Minimization Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10487893</link><description>The simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) has emerged as a novel concept and promising technology for future wireless networks. In this article, we propose a STAR-RIS assisted multi-access edge computing (MEC) framework, where the user offloads the tasks to multiple edge nodes, and the STAR-RIS is deployed to enable and enhance the multiple offloading links at the same time. Meanwhile, the hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (h-NOMA) is adopted to further improve the performance of the STAR-RIS assisted downlink parallel offloading. We aim to minimize the latency by jointly optimizing the offloading order and task division to the edge nodes, the time allocation for the time-division multiple access (TDMA) transmission and the NOMA transmission in the h-NOMA scheme, the transmit power and the decoding orders when employing NOMA, and the transmitting and reflecting coefficients at the STAR-RIS. To solve this highly complex optimization problem, we first derive the optimal solutions of the time allocation and task division in closed forms, and then propose a low-complexity alternative optimizing (AO) algorithm based on successive convex approximation (SCA) technique to optimize the allocation of radio resources. Simulation results show that the proposed STAR-RIS assisted offloading scheme based on h-NOMA can effectively reduce the time latency compared with benchmark schemes, especially when the number of the STAR-RIS elements is small.</description></item><item><title>Secure and Distributed IoV Data Sharing Scheme Based on a Hybrid PoS Blockchain Protocol</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480287</link><description>Internet of Vehicles (IoV) enables vehicles and other smart terminals to share data in order to improve traffic safety and efficiency. With the increase in data volume and data interaction frequency, the burden of the central server increases dramatically, and it is difficult for resource-limited vehicles to store and verify all messages in the untrusted environment as well. Therefore, a secure and distributed IoV data-sharing scheme needs to be constructed. This paper proposes a hybrid proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain consensus and constructs a secure and efficient distributed IoV data-sharing scheme based on it. In this scheme, participants can store and share data securely in a distributed way through blockchain. The hybrid PoS blockchain consensus, where block producers are chosen based on their own stakes, and multiple trusted managers supervise each other updating head blocks periodically, maintains a more secure blockchain as a consistent and tamper-proof record for data sharing, than some researches using existing consensus, as shown in the security analysis. Every entity can participate in the blockchain consensus equally, without consuming high computation power, which improves the distribution degree and achieves co-governance of the IoV system. The performance evaluation shows that referring to the Gini coefficient, our scheme achieves a higher degree of decentralization than other schemes with only RSUs participants. In this way, vehicles collaborating with roadside units, realize distributed storage and secure data sharing to whoever with their authorization.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Pricing for Vehicle Dispatching in Mobility-as-a-Service Market via Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475562</link><description>Vehicle dispatching in the mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) market has gradually become a situation of multi-service provider competition and coexistence. However, most existing research on vehicle dispatching with dynamic pricing for the MaaS market is still limited to single-service provider scenarios. In this paper, we propose an economic model that analyzes the vehicle dispatching service pricing and demand interactions between multiple mobility service providers (MSPs) and passengers, respectively. We formulate the vehicle dispatching service pricing and demand problem as a two-stage Stackelberg game under different pricing schemes, namely, independent pricing scheme (IPS) and competitive pricing scheme (CPS), considering the vehicle supply-demand relationship and market competition among the MSPs. The MSPs, as leaders, set their service pricing strategies first, and then the passengers, as the followers, determine their service demands. Due to the high-dimensional and complicated nature of the dynamic MaaS market environment, we develop a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm to achieve the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the formulated game, which indicates the optimal pricing and demand strategies for MSPs and passengers. Simulation results and analysis show that the proposed MADRL-based algorithm converges to the optimal solution and outperforms other benchmark schemes under both IPS and CPS in terms of maximizing MSPs' revenue and protecting passengers' benefits. Furthermore, the proposed MADRL-based algorithm under CPS improves MSPs' market attractiveness and long-term benefits, which encourages MSPs to participate in competitive vehicle dispatching in the MaaS market.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Efficient Resource Management for Multi-UAV-Enabled Mobile Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10477460</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely utilized to expand wireless network coverage and provide computation service for Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in signal-blocked or shadowed environments. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-UAV-enabled mobile edge computing (MEC) architecture in which multiple UAVs provide both communication and computation services for IoT devices that cannot directly access the ground edge clouds. To achieve min-max fairness of energy consumption among UAVs, we minimize the maximal energy consumption among UAVs by jointly optimizing computation offloading decisions, communication and computation resource allocation, UAV positions, and task splitting decisions, while meeting the delay requirement of all tasks. The required optimization is a large-scale mixed-integer non-linear program that is generally intractable. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm based on the successive convex approximation (SCA). The simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms various baseline schemes in processing computation-intensive and latency-critical tasks.</description></item><item><title>Task Offloading and Energy Optimization in Hybrid UAV-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10477451</link><description>The paper considers a more challenging task offloading scenario in hybrid UAV-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) systems, where multiple dual-function UAVs tour in the sky to serve ground users (GUs) by acting as edge servers or aerial relays. Since each task can be executed on GUs, UAVs and the base station (BS) in parallel, the service assignment, task splitting, trajectory of UAVs, as well as resource and transmission power of both UAVs and GUs should be jointly optimized to minimize the system energy consumption with the subjection of the maximum tolerable latency and computing limitations. To tackle such mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm is proposed in the paper to seek a close optimal solution with low-complexity. In specific, the binary service assignment and continuous task splitting are obtained by DRL, while the trajectory planning and resource scheduling are jointly optimized by SCA in sequence to speed up the convergence. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed DRL-SCA algorithm equipped with dual-function UAV scheme is more effective in making full use of the on-board resource of UAVs and reducing the overall system energy consumption.</description></item><item><title>Energy-Aware Joint Route Selection and Resource Allocation in Heterogeneous Satellite Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10496916</link><description>In order to ensure efficient data transmission from satellites to ground stations (GSs), resource allocation schemes must be designed. In cases where direct data transmission from satellites to GSs is not possible due to a dynamic network topology and limited contact time, efficient relay selection or route selection schemes should be employed. This paper considers a satellite communication network in which a number of source low earth orbit(SLEO) satellites are attempting to transmit their data flows to the designated GSs. To improve the transmission performance of the data flows, one geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) satellite and a number of relay LEO (RLEO) satellites in the network are used as relays. To maximize energy efficiency, a joint route selection and resource allocation mechanism is proposed. The energy cost of the system, which is the sum of the energy cost of the SLEO satellites and the RLEO satellites, is used to formulate the joint route selection and resource allocation as a system energy cost minimization problem. Since the original optimization problem is NP hard, it is transformed into three subproblems: inter-satellite power allocation, satellite-ground power allocation, and route selection. These subproblems are solved using a greedy algorithm, the Lagrange dual method, and a matching-based heuristic algorithm, respectively. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Multi-Objective Dynamic Offloading Scheduling for Air&#8211;Ground Cooperative MEC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10475575</link><description>Utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with edge server to assist terrestrial mobile edge computing (MEC) has attracted tremendous attention. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art schemes based on deterministic optimizations or single-objective reinforcement learning (RL) cannot reduce the backlog of task bits and simultaneously improve energy efficiency in highly dynamic network environments, where the design problem amounts to a sequential decision-making problem. In order to address the aforementioned problems, as well as the curses of dimensionality introduced by the growing number of terrestrial terrestrial users, this paper proposes a distributed multi-objective (MO) dynamic trajectory planning and offloading scheduling scheme, integrated with MORL and the kernel method. The design of n-step return is also applied to average fluctuations in the backlog. Numerical results reveal that the n-step return can benefit the proposed kernel-based approach, achieving significant improvement in the long-term average backlog performance, compared to the conventional 1-step return design. Due to such design and the kernel-based neural network, to which decision-making features can be continuously added, the kernel-based approach can outperform the approach based on fully-connected deep neural network, yielding improvement in energy consumption and the backlog performance, as well as a significant reduction in decision-making and online learning time.</description></item><item><title>ICNet: GNN-Enabled Beamforming for MISO Interference Channels With Statistical CSI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478677</link><description>This paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN) based model, termed interference channel net (ICNet), for multiple-input single-output (MISO) interference channels with statistical channel state information (CSI). After a graphic representation of MISO interference channels, the ICNet directly maps the statistical CSI to the beamforming vectors, and the attention mechanism is adopted to jointly utilize the node and edge features. Via unsupervised learning, the ICNet is able to solve the outage-constrained energy efficiency maximization problem. Numerical results show that the ICNet is with millisecond-level inference time compared to the second-level inference time of the convex optimization based algorithm and achieves less than 5% average optimality loss to the convex optimization based algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Inter-Carrier Interference Reduction Technique for Backscattered OFDM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480310</link><description>The objective of this letter is to improve the bit error performance of backscattering sensors that implement Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). Many recent works in the literature have demonstrated the implementation of OFDM transmission from backscattering tags. A persistent shortcoming in such systems is the Bit Error Rate (BER) floor due to increased levels of Inter-Carrier Interference resulting from spectral spreading. In this letter, the authors employ unused subcarriers of the OFDM modulator to design an interference cancellation signal. The time domain signal is matched to the resolution of the impedance switching states of the tag. Significant suppression of the inter-carrier interference is possible with roughly equal numbers of used and unused subcarriers. Lower interference values result in lower BER floors. Furthermore, this technique allows the use of a larger number of data subcarriers than other existing techniques in the literature. The tag energy consumption per bit can therefore be reduced.</description></item><item><title>Physical Layer Security for Near-Field Communications via Directional Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480457</link><description>Recently, near-field communications (NFCs) have drawn great attention for the near-field region expansion in the context of extremely large-scale (XL) antenna arrays, tremendously high frequencies, and new types of antennas trends. Considering the distinctive spherical wave propagation model in NFC, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) techniques, such as channel modelling and estimation as well as hybrid beamforming technologies, have recently undergone reevaluation and redesign. Concurrently, as the NFC range continues to broaden, ensuring physical layer security (PLS) has emerged as an equally urgent concern, necessitating immediate attention and resolution. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose a single-user (SU) multiple-input single-output (MISO) near-field directional modulation (NFDM) system toward secure transmissions at both angular and distance scales. Furthermore, considering the hardware cost associated with XL arrays, a fully analog secure precoding algorithm integrated beamforming with artificial noise (AN) as well as power allocation is devised under the modulus-1 constraint of the phase shifters. Finally, simulation results indicate that the proposed NFDM scheme is capable of guaranteeing security at both angular and distance scales compared with its conventional far-field counterpart.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid MRT and ZF Learning for Energy-Efficient Transmission in Multi-RIS-Assisted Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480579</link><description>The deep reinforcement learning-based transmission design for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted multiple input single output networks is investigated in this research. An energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated under constraints of the rate requirement, the power budget and the phase shift coefficient. To be adaptable to various wireless channel conditions, a novel model-based beamforming design, namely the hybrid maximum ratio transmission (MRT) and zero-forcing (ZF) scheme, is proposed in the action space. Besides, a new activation function is adopted to handle the power budget constraint. The proximal policy optimization (PPO) approach is adopted to learn the optimal policy. Numerical results validate the efficacy of the hybrid MRT and ZF scheme as well as the PPO-based algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Spectral Coexistence for Power-Harvested Multiuser Communication System With Radar</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10476770</link><description>In this paper, a co-design scheme for simultaneous optimization of the performance of radar and communication system in spectrum coexistence scenario is developed. Considering the possible information mismatch, the interference covariance matrices are reconstructed firstly. Then we adopt the signal-to-interference-plus noise ratio (SINR) on the radar side and the harvested power on the communication side as the performance indicators of the two systems, and obtain a weighted non-convex optimization formulation under the power constraints and similarity constraint. A sequential iterative optimization framework is presented to transform the non-convex problem into several single-variable subproblems, which exploits an alternating iterative procedure that combines Minorization-Maximization (MM) framework and double quadratic form optimizations with separable design (whose solution can be provided in closed-form). Finally, the merits of the proposed design are verified by simulation results.</description></item><item><title>LAPS-and-D2D Enabled Maritime Emergency Communications: Deployment Optimization and Resource Management</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478646</link><description>This paper investigates the application of low altitude platform station (LAPS) and device-to-device (D2D) techniques in maritime emergency communications. The hovering LAPS acts as an aerial base station to provide emergency telecommunications services, and the D2D technique is used to improve spectrum utilization. To make full use of the advantages of LAPS-and-D2D enabled networks, we formulate a sum rate maximization problem by jointly considering the deployment optimization and resource management (DORM). The formulated problem is constrained by the reliability and minimum capacity requirements. To solve this problem, an iterative optimization algorithm (IOA) is designed. First, by using the graphical method, the closed-form solution of optimal power allocation is derived. Next, we transform the spectrum reuse problem into a min-cost max-flow problem, and the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm is employed to solve it. Then, we present a meta-heuristic algorithm to optimize the LAPS deployment. Finally, the simulation results indicate that the proposed DORM scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art works in term of the sum rate. In addition, the convergence and performance gap of the designed IOA are demonstrated.</description></item><item><title>Photovoltaics and Agriculture Nexus: Exploring the Influence of Agrivoltaics on Food Production and Electricity Generation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10613921</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) installations contribute to more sustainable solutions in satisfying clean energy requirements and are essential to global efforts to mitigate climate change. The PV development has extensive space requirements, complicated by the increasing competition for land due to rising population growth and food demand. By installing solar panels on agricultural land, agrivoltaic (APV) offers a resource-efficient solution to the persistent problem of competition for arable lands. This study presents a systematic review of the impact of APV applications on crop yields, agricultural product quality, plant growth microclimate, power generation, human comfort level, economic benefits, and social welfare. In total, 138 APV studies were reviewed in five typical agricultural scenarios, including open-field farming, greenhouse, aquaculture, livestock farming, and forestry, and 34 articles summarized the main metrics for evaluating APV performance. The majority of studies indicate positive impacts of APV on open-field agricultural practices. APV coverage of less than 20% on the greenhouse roof has minimal adverse effects. Livestock farming APV helps reduce heat stress and improve animal welfare. Deploying APV panels in aquaculture fishery mitigates the rise in water temperature and improves water quality. The quantitative analysis and investigation of the impact of APV on agricultural production in this study help develop efficient APV systems worldwide.</description></item><item><title>Improvement of Laser Contact Opening in Bifacial PERC Solar Cells by Optimizing the Dashed Pattern</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10577474</link><description>The laser contact opening in passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) is essential for establishing contact between silicon and aluminum. On bifacial PERC solar cells, dashed patterns are commonly employed as an alternative to continuous openings to mitigate excessive losses associated with passivation film removal. In this work, we investigate the optimization of dashed patterns in detail. First, under the condition of the same 50% opening ratio, the optimal total length of segments is determined to be 1.2 mm. Subsequently, testing various opening ratio patterns on wafers with different resistivities reveals that low-resistivity wafers are better suited for low opening ratio patterns. Finally, simulation analyses using Quokka2 software assess the variations in power loss associated with different opening patterns, the simulation results align with those of experiments. This work provides a guidance for the rear-side laser opening pattern design of bifacial PERC solar cells.</description></item><item><title>Development of APCVD BSG and POCl3 Codiffusion Process for Double-Side TOPCon Solar Cell Precursor Fabrication</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10599136</link><description>This article presents a commercially viable process for fabricating a high-quality double-side tunnel oxide passivating contact (DS-TOPCon) cell precursor using atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition deposited boron silicate glass and ex situ POCl3 diffusion in a single high-temperature step, eliminating the need for additional masking and diffusion processes. A two-tier temperature profile was developed, involving a preannealing at above 900 &#176;C in nitrogen ambient followed by POCl3 diffusion at 840 &#176;C. We investigated the effect of varying preannealing temperatures, ranging from 875 to 950 &#176;C, on the passivation quality and metal-Si contact properties of both n-TOPCon and p-TOPCon layers. The resultant DS-TOPCon cell precursor after silicon nitride passivation exhibited an excellent iVOC of close to 730 mV. In addition, a rapid asymmetric poly-Si thinning technique, developed in this work, enabled adjustment of the front n+ poly-Si thickness while maintaining the rear p+ poly-Si thickness. Two types of DS-TOPCon cell architectures can be fabricated: i) full-area thin (&#8776;40 nm) n-TOPCon layer on the front and ii) selective-area thick (&#8776;200 nm) n-TOPCon fingers underneath the metal grid. Device simulations suggest that full-area DS-TOPCon cell with 40 nm n+ poly-Si and selective-area DS-TOPCon cell with 200 nm n+ poly fingers on the front, fabricated from our current DS-TOPCon cell precursor, can achieve cell efficiencies of 22.1% and 23.5%, respectively. Detailed power loss analysis and device simulation reveal that further improvements in material and device parameters have the potential to push the cell efficiencies of DS-TOPCon cell structure beyond 25%, making it a promising alternative to fabricate high-efficiency next-generation solar cells at low cost.</description></item><item><title>CdSe With Mixed Zincblende and Wurtzite Phases Grown on Lattice-Matched InAs Substrates Using Molecular Beam Epitaxy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10584072</link><description>The II&#8211;VI compound semiconductor CdSe, which has both zincblende (ZB) and wurtzite (WZ) phases with bandgap energies of 1.67 and 1.74 eV, respectively, is an ideal candidate material for the top cell in a tandem solar cell with a Si bottom cell to achieve higher power conversion efficiency. In this work, molecular beam epitaxy growth of CdSe thin films on lattice-matched InAs(100) substrates reveals a single-phase ZB structure with high crystallinity and a low defect density. In contrast, all CdSe layers grown on InAs(111)B substrates have mixed ZB and WZ phases in coexistence, as confirmed by high-resolution X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. The PL efficiencies of the CdSe layers grown on (111)B substrates are substantially lower than those grown on (100) substrates. This result is attributed to defects at the boundaries between the two different phases. Postgrowth annealing of CdSe layers grown on InAs(111)B at 250&#8211;450&#8201;&#176;C converts most of the CdSe ZB material into the WZ phase, as evidenced by improved PL efficiency and TEM images. Density functional theory simulations confirm that the formation energy difference between the ZB and WZ phases for CdSe is very small compared with other conventional compound semiconductors, which is in good agreement with the experimental observations.</description></item><item><title>Photovoltaic Cable Connectors: A Comparative Assessment of the Present State of the Industry</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10596700</link><description>The consequences of failure for balance-of-systems components (such as photovoltaic (PV) cable connectors) include offline module string(s); low system voltage; arc, ground, insulation, and overtemperature faults; triggered fuse(s); system shutdown; and fire. The degradation modes for connectors are studied here through an industry survey and its subsequent examination, which are compared with field-degraded specimens. A total of 117 specimens were obtained from a variety of locations and climates or accelerated tests. A failure analysis for connectors from PV installations was developed (and applied to 54 specimens), including nondestructive examinations (photography, a custom resistance&#8211;current scan, and X-ray computed tomography) and destructive examinations (featuring milling of the external plastic, extraction of the internal convolute spring, and potting and polishing in cross section). Surface and through-thickness composition of the metal pins and springs was quantified using scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy was used to verify the base polymer materials and compare the chemical structure of the connector body, bushing, end nut, and o-ring. Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were used to further verify the degradation of the same polymeric components.</description></item><item><title>Irradiance Monitoring for Bifacial PV Systems&#8217; Performance and Capacity Testing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10614655</link><description>Three standards for photovoltaic (PV) performance and capacity testing are evaluated for bifacial PV system reporting: performance ratio, ASTM E2848, and a new draft of IEC 61724-2. In this context, challenges and recommendations for rear irradiance instrumentation are described for three types of bifacial irradiance sensors&#8212;horizontal albedometer, backward-facing reference cells (or pyranometer), and bifacial reference module. A year of operating field data for single-axis tracked bifacial and monofacial systems was collected, including periods of high surface albedo due to snow ground cover. If snowy conditions are included, we found that all three methods performed comparably to the monofacial baseline case, but only if rear-measured irradiance is incorporated into the expected energy calculation. The lowest RMS error was obtained by following the draft IEC 61724-2 standard and using a calibrated bifacial reference module for bifacial irradiance resource. If measured rear irradiance is unavailable, field conditions either need to be filtered to avoid variable (snowy) albedo or an albedometer measurement can be used in conjunction with modeled rear irradiance along with the draft IEC procedure. Additional practical factors are described, including the proper placement of rear irradiance sensors and the proper interpretation of IEC 61724-1 bifacial performance ratio calculations.</description></item><item><title>A Global Nonlinear Model for Photovoltaic Modules Based on 3-D Surface Fitting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10568301</link><description>The main objective of this work is to propose a global nonlinear model (GNLM), valid under varying solar irradiance (G) and temperature (T) conditions, generating characteristic curves that closely replicate the actual behavior of the evaluated modules. The proposed GNLM incorporates a technique that combines surface polynomial fitting based on numerical optimization. This integration results in the creation of unique adaptable surfaces for each parameter, providing them with flexibility. Additionally, the research also aims to investigate other nonlinear global models for photovoltaic modules and conduct a comparative study of accuracy. The proposed model demonstrated significantly superior results compared with the best model evaluated in the literature for xSi modules, with a normalized mean absolute error in power (NMAEP) percentage difference of 98.21% and a normalized root mean square deviation (NRMSD) difference of 25.60%. In contrast, for mSi modules, the results showed a slight improvement over the same model, with an NMAEP percentage difference of 26.19% and an NRMSD difference of 1.52%.

ARC abrasion is often studied via accelerated lab tests, however field tests are needed to achieve real-world abrasion conditions. In this study nine types of PV modules and five types of ARC coupons were subjected to 18 months of dry-brush robot cleaning in the desert climate of Doha, Qatar. Three cleaning schedules were tested: daily, weekly, and never (reference samples subject to weathering alone). Modules&#8217; power (Pmax), current (Isc), and reflectivity changes were measured and compared between the various cleaning schedules. It was found that the abrasion resistance of PV modules varied greatly. Five kinds of module showed greater losses with more frequent cleaning, while the other four did not. Lab profilometry of the coupons similarly found large variability of the depth and quantity of scratches for different ARCs, because of the difference in ARC durability between modules, and the likelihood that different cleaning robots will vary in their harshness, it is recommended to test specific robot/module pairs in the field to be confident of their ARC degradation rate.</description></item><item><title>A Method for the Estimation of Missing Strings in Very-Large-Scale Photovoltaic Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10613882</link><description>This article presents a novel methodology to detect missing strings in very-large-scale photovoltaic (VLSPV) systems, utilizing only data acquired at the stringbox level.

Currently, the synaptic weight symbolic limitation and weight update inaccuracy are two challenging issues to be solved. In this work, a novel memristive synapse and a matched mixed-signal neuron circuit are designed to implement robust yet accurate spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning in excitatory and inhibitory synapses. To break through the weight symbolic limitation, a four memristors and two resistors (4M2R) synapse composed of 4M2R for spiking neural network (SNN) is designed. The proposed synapse can be either excitatory or inhibitory (E/I) by rationally arranging the resistors in the circuit, and it is the first of its kind, enabling Hebbian and anti-Hebbian training without additional adjusting of neural signals. In addition, the high symmetricity, linearity, and stability against device variation of the 4M2R synapse can also greatly improve the weight update accuracy. To further address the inaccurate weight update issue caused by signal complexity, a neuron circuit is designed to generate square-wave pulses for spike transmission and synaptic weight modulation. Simulations are carried out in the MATLAB Simscape as well as Virtuoso using SMIC  $0.18~\mu $ m process and a specially developed memristor model for SNN synapse simulation. The simulating results show good agreement with the weight change derived from the algorithmic methods, and the influence of weak signal-induced weight variation on circuit performance can be rigorously assessed.</description></item><item><title>Multibit Content Addressable Memory Design and Optimization Based on 3-D nand-Compatible IGZO Flash</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10521670</link><description>Content addressable memory (CAM) has been employed in various data-intensive tasks for its parallel pattern-matching capability. To enhance the density and efficiency of CAMs, emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM) technologies have been exploited in the CAM designs. Recently, the multilevel cell (MLC) characteristics of NVMs have been utilized in several analog and multibit CAM designs, achieving higher density than conventional binary/ternary CAM designs. However, these analog and multibit CAM designs are built with the practical experience of circuit designers, lacking a general analog/multibit design methodology. In this article, we propose a general and effective design and optimization scheme for multibit CAM, using a novel 3-D nand-compatible amorphous indium-gallium&#8211;zinc-oxide (IGZO) flash as a proxy of three-terminal NVM devices. The proposed scheme encodes the multibit data into the flash devices, enabling the 3-D nand flash array to operate as an ultradense nand or nor CAM without significant structural change. For further performance optimization, we propose a design space exploration scheme for optimal CAM parameters. Evaluation results suggest that the CAM design based on our proposed design and optimization scheme achieves over  $35\times $  area per bit saving compared with the representative ferroelectric field effect transistor (FeFET)-based multibit CAM, and a  $38.1\times $  energy-delay-area product (EDAP) improvement over the state-of-the-art analog CAM, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Channel Package-Scale Galvanic Isolation Interface for Wide Bandgap Gate Drivers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10495721</link><description>This article presents the design of a three-channel package-scale galvanic isolation interface for SiC and GaN power switching converters. The isolation interface consists of two side-by-side co- packaged chips fabricated in a low-cost 0.32- $\mu \text{m}$  bipolar CMOS&#8211;DMOS (BCD) technology and includes three isolation data channels based on RF-coupled integrated microantennas. The isolation interface provides a channel for the gate driver control, a bidirectional channel for diagnostic, and a channel for the isolated power supply control. They use on&#8211;off keying (OOK)-modulated RF carriers of 1.5, 0.5, and 1.5 GHz, respectively. The galvanic isolation interface provides a maximum signal rate of 2 and 1.9 MHz for the driver and the power control channels, respectively, whereas the diagnostic channel guarantees half-duplex bidirectional communication up to 15 MHz. Thanks to the package-scale isolation approach, both reinforced galvanic isolation and first-rate common-mode transient immunity (CMTI) are achieved. High immunity to adjacent channel crosstalk is guaranteed by using channel frequency/physical separation. To best of the authors&#8217; knowledge, this is the first implementation of a package-scale galvanic isolation interface with three independent communication channels, including a bidirectional channel, in silicon technology.</description></item><item><title>A Power-On-Reset Circuit With Accurate Trigger-Point Voltage and Ultralow Typical Quiescent Current for Emerging Nonvolatile Memory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10494042</link><description>In this article, a power-on-reset (POR) circuit with accurate trigger-point voltage and ultralow typical quiescent current for emerging nonvolatile memory (NVM) is presented. To keep the trigger-point voltage from the effect of process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) and supply ramp rate variations, low-cost current generators and a current comparator are adopted with brown-out detection (BOD). A protection circuit is utilized for correct operations in different BOD events. Meanwhile, delay blocks are utilized to generate reliable pulse signals that are less influenced by temperature and supply ramp rate. The simulation results show that the trigger-point voltage is 2.08 V with a temperature coefficient (TC) of 81.8 ppm/&#176;C and a deviation to the ramp time of 9.91% for a wide ramp time range from  $10 ~\mu \text{s}$  to dc. In addition, the reset duration time of the POR pulse is also reliable.

This mixed-computation approach uses 4-bit Posit (Posit4), which has higher precision around 0, for representing weights with high sensitivity, while it uses 4-bit FixP (FixP4) for representing other weights. A heuristic for analyzing the importance and the quantization error of the weights is presented to assign the proper number system to different weights. In addition, a gradient approximation for Posit representation is introduced to improve the quality of weight updates in the backpropagation process. Due to the high energy consumption of the fully Posit-based computations, neural network operations are carried out in FixP or Posit/FixP.

It embeds error detection (ED), correction, and latching circuits within a flip-flop (FF) with an additional 15 transistors to monitor critical paths. Notably, iEDCL&#8217;s error-aware capability remains stable despite clock latency and parasitic effects, relieving designers of extensive involvement and eliminating false errors. iEDCL is automatedly implemented in an ARM Cortex-M0 processor at 55 nm without extra architecture modifications, incurring only a 6.78% area overhead. An adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) loop enables automatic operation, achieving high energy efficiency beyond the point of the first failure while maintaining a predefined error rate. Measurement results obtained from different dies at various temperatures demonstrate significant energy savings achieved by the iEDCL processor, with up to 16.9% and 49.1% reductions compared to critical baseline and signoff designs, respectively, while maintaining a 5% error rate at a 16 MHz frequency.

This research meticulously explores polynomial multiplication from the context of algebraic structures by introducing a novel hetero-blend recursive multiplier that harnesses the strengths of the contemporary state-of-the-art (SOTA) designs. The heterogeneous-blend recursive multiplier (HRM) adeptly merges the footprint efficiency of the Karatsuba multiplier (KM) and the compute-latency benefits of the overlap-free KM (OKM) at higher stages, while at lower bounds, it capitalizes the optimal balance of footprint and compute-latency benefits of the schoolbook multiplier (SBM). To further enhance the performance, HRM integrates the heterogeneous term division throughout its stages which is a characteristic find taken from the prior work on M-term nonhomogeneous Karatsuba multiplier (MNHKA). Furthermore, a MATLAB framework has been devised to expedite the exploration process in the finite field design space resulting from the heterogeneous usage of the M terms across multiple stages. The presented HRM design undergoes comprehensive evaluation when benchmarked against contemporary SOTA designs including KM, OKM, their corresponding homogeneous M term variants referred to as M-term Karatsuba multiplier (MKM), M-term OKM (MOKM) alongside recent variants of composite M-term Karatsuba multipliers (CMKA), MNHKA, and equivalent overlap-free variant M-term nonhomogeneous overlap-free Karatsuba multiplier (MNHOKA). The field-programmable gate array (FPGA) synthesized results for the HRM designs on Zynq ZCU-104 board showcase a best-case of 17.288% lookup table (LUT) savings, 5.68% reduction in delay, and 20.88% gain in area-delay product (ADP) compared with the optimal SOTA design, while also revealing a 13.49% reduction in LUT usage, 5.45% decrease in delay, and 12.97% improvement in ADP when compared with the best among MNHKA and MNHOKA designs. Furthermore HRM designs synthesized on the Cadence GPDK45 library achieved a best-case footprint saving of 16.18%, a critical path delay improvement of 29.53%, a remarkable 45.66% gain in the ADP, a substantial 30.37% reduction in power consumption, and a noteworthy 38.63% improvement in power per area when compared with the optimal SOTA design. In comparison to the leading MNHKA and MNHOKA designs, the HRM designs exhibit a best-case footprint improvement of 5.77%, 8.31% reduction in delay, 16.76% enhancement in ADP, a significant 20.18% power savings, and a notable 17.71% improvement in power-per-unit-area (PPA).

This article proposes a 112-channel system-on-chip (SoC) design for neural signal acquisition and processing, comprising full-channel read-out circuits, neural signal-processing accelerators, and a 32-bit RISC-V core. A clock-domain-crossing (CDC) structure is devised to minimize data storage overhead in read-out circuits, facilitating comprehensive data acquisition and high-throughput simultaneous transmission from all channels. The channel-specific processing unit incorporates hardware-efficient designs for lossless compression, spike detection, and extraction of spike features. A multistage predictor module serves the dual purpose of narrowing data distribution during compression and signal augmentation during spike detection. The proposed design was fabricated in 40-nm technology with an area of 6.67 mm2. The acquisition of 112 channels achieves a peak data rate of 57.3 Mbps, with a total power consumption of 3.07 mW, wherein 0.87 mW is attributed to the read-out circuits. The processing accelerators feature an area consumption of 0.011 mm2/ch, and a minimal power consumption of only  $0.2~{\mu }$ W/ch under a 32-kHz clock.

With the recent advances of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology, in particular, the necessity to endow interconnected devices with security facilities has increased as well. In this context, the efficient implementation of ROs on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) is crucial, even though it hides some pitfalls. This article presents a new design strategy for multistage ROs relying on the carry chains (CCs) available into modern FPGA devices. Several configurations of ROs designed as proposed here have been characterized in terms of hardware costs, jitter, and temperature/voltage sensitivity. In all the evaluated cases, the proposed design allows to achieve predictable routing schemes through the automatic place and route (P&amp;amp;R), while reducing slice occupancy and energy consumption by up to 50% and 44%, respectively, in comparison with the traditional lookup table (LUT)-based ROs. When realized on a Artix-7 device, the basic version of the proposed oscillator realized using 33 inverting stages allows obtaining multiphase outputs oscillating at 29.7 MHz with a standard deviation less than 10 kHz. The analysis conducted also demonstrates the high flexibility of the novel circuits, such as the possibility to easily change their behavior depending on the target application requirements. As an example, by exploiting additional pass-through elements, the proposed scheme achieves a sensitivity of 49 kHz/&#176;C that is more than 4 times higher than that shown by the corresponding traditional LUT-based competitor, thus making it more suitable for thermal monitoring applications.</description></item><item><title>A Design Framework for Generating Energy-Efficient Accelerator on FPGA Toward Low-Level Vision</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559268</link><description>Low-level vision algorithms play an increasingly crucial role in a wide range of applications, such as biomedical, security, and autopilot. The low-level vision accelerators have also been extensively researched. As low-level vision is often deployed in embedded devices, its accelerators need to achieve high energy efficiency. Meanwhile, the broad application scenarios of low-level vision contribute to its rapid iteration. Designing energy-efficient accelerators for quickly evolving low-level vision algorithms demands substantial effort. Therefore, a design framework specifically tailored for the generation of low-level vision accelerators is urgently needed. In this article, we propose an end-to-end algorithm-hardware generation framework, EffiVision, on field-programmable gate array (FPGA), aimed at generating highly energy-efficient dedicated accelerators for low-level vision neural networks. EffiVision proposes a hardware template that features multiple parallelisms and large architecture exploration spaces specifically designed to accommodate the characteristics of low-level vision networks. Then, it employs activation-weight aware mixed-precision quantization and FPGA-aware NNLUTs to search the suitable hardware parameters within the hardware template, generating highly energy-efficient accelerators tailored for low-level vision networks. We used EffiVision to perform hardware generation for three low-level vision neural networks fast super-resolution convolutional neural network (FSRCNN), denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNN), and demosaicing convolutional neural network (DMCNN) on Xilinx FPGA development boards, achieving the best energy efficiencies of 174.9, 97.8, and 92.7 GOPS/W, respectively. The generated accelerators of FSRCNN and DnCNN are  $1.11\times $  and  $3.37\times $  more efficient than previous works.</description></item><item><title>A 40-Gb/s PAM-3 Receiver With Modified Summer-Merged Slicers and PRTS Checker</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10517958</link><description>This article presents a 40-Gb/s (25.6 GBaud) quarter-rate receiver utilizing three-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM).

Particularly, a coupled technique with bandpass (CTB) characteristic between the kth output node and the ( $k+1$ )th input node of amplification units (AUs) is adopted in the DPA design. It generates an additional signal reuse path (SRP) to reuse part of the output signal to superimpose the input signal, and then they will be reamplified to the output artificial transmission line (O-ATML). Moreover, due to the bandpass characteristic, the signal reuse can be manipulated to target the upper cutting edges of the working band to alleviate sharp gain and power roll-off. By carefully controlling the SRP, the overall gain, output power, and bandwidth are enhanced and extended. The systematic design approach for the DPA is detailed with circuit implementations and optimizations. To validate the proposed concept, a DPA MMIC prototype is implemented and fabricated in a commercial 0.25- $\mu $ m gallium nitride (GaN)-on-silicon carbide (SiC) high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) process. It shows the compact layout within a die size of 3.36 mm2. Under 28-V VDD power supply, the measured results show a flat  $14.8\pm 1.0$ -dB small-signal gain with 10.0-GHz wide operating bandwidth and good impedance matching conditions. A saturated output power ( ${P} _{\text {sat}}$ ) of 7.25 W with peak power-added efficiency (PAE) exceeding 38.7% is achieved. The proposed DPA obtains around 1.54&#8211;2.16-W/mm2 power density associated with an average PAE of 34.5% over the entire frequency range.</description></item><item><title>ALT-Lock: Logic and Timing Ambiguity-Based IP Obfuscation Against Reverse Engineering</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10559389</link><description>We present a logic ambiguity-based intellectual property (IP) obfuscation method that replaces traditional key gates with key-controlled functionally ambiguous logic gates, called LGA gates. We also protect timing paths by developing timing-ambiguous sequential cells called TA cells. We call this locking scheme ambiguous logic and timing logic locking (referred to as ALT-Lock). ALT-Lock ensures a two-pronged system-level security scheme where the attacker is forced to unlock not only combinational logic obfuscation but also timing obfuscation. We show that a combination of logic and timing ambiguity (TA) provides security against oracle-guided attacks. This method is superior to other traditional IP protection schemes such as combinational or sequential locking as it guarantees security against both oracle-guided and oracle-free attacks, while ensuring low power, performance, and area (PPA) overhead.</description></item><item><title>Symmetric and Multiphase-Interleaved Ladder Bucks for DC Capacitors Elimination</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10510403</link><description>To improve power density, a symmetric switched-capacitor (SC) ladder buck (SLB) is proposed in this brief that eliminates the fixed ladder in an SC ladder buck (SCLB) by tying the dc nodes in two 180&#176;-phase-shifted cells together. Unlike flying capacitor multilevel converters (FCMCs) that minimize the inductor current ripple, the ladder topology within an SCLB splits the inductor current optimally among the ladder switches, such that the overall equivalent output resistance is minimized. M-phase interleaving is proposed in this brief to allow SLB to regain this current splitting capability when operating via duty cycles larger than 0.5. Simulation results of a six-level four-phase design in 180-nm CMOS verify the performance advantages of the proposed topology.</description></item><item><title>An Unconditional Evenly Spaced STRO With a New Mitigated Drafting Effect Muller C-Element</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10520312</link><description>Muller C-element (MCE) can be utilized in synchronous circuits by forming an oscillator so-called self-timed ring oscillators (STROs).

The differential-like OTA consists of two asymmetric branches. The inverting branch used for multichannel inputs has more inverters in parallel than that of the noninverting branch used for reference. Two virtual rails with very low impedance are designed in the differential-like OTA to effectively reduce the noise-efficiency-factor (NEF) and crosstalk in input channels. The NEF and the effective average current per channel decreases as the number of channels increases. Furthermore, by optimizing the current ratio of the inverting and the noninverting branches of the OTA, the NEF of the proposed amplifier is minimized and approaches the NEF of an ideal inverter of  $\sqrt {2}/2$  as the channel counts increase to infinity. The area per channel is reduced even more significantly as the channel counts increase. The proposed amplifier architecture with 4-channel, 16-channel, and 64-channel configurations were fabricated and measured. The results show that the noise, power, and area performance were all improved by integrating more channels in parallel. For the 64-channel amplifier, the measured NEF is 0.84, the effective average current per channel is 422 nA and the area per channel is only 0.044 mm2.</description></item><item><title>An Enhanced Class-F Dual-Core VCO With Common-Mode-Noise Self-Cancellation and Isolation Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10453607</link><description>In this article, an enhanced class-F voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with common-mode-noise self-cancellation (CM-NC) and common-mode-noise isolation (CM-NI) technique is proposed. With the proposed CM-NC technique, the common-mode-noise current of the drain coil and that of the nearby source coil are in the opposite direction. Therefore, the magnetic fields generated by the two coils cancel each other, which reduces the noise injected into the VCO from power supply and the ground node. Moreover, the principle of decoupling between the two inductors is also employed to eliminate the influence of the common-mode tail inductor on the differential mode. By winding the gate coil into a double-turn structure, the coupling noise from the drain inductor to the gate is opposite to the induced current of the gate coil, thereby cutting off the noise coupling path from the drain to the gate. Thanks to the dual-core 8-shaped inductor structure, the phase noise (PN) is improved without increasing the area, compared with existing methods using separated and dedicated tail filtering inductors. The VCO is fabricated in a 65-nm complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technology. The measured tuning range is 21.7% from 11.5 to 14.3 GHz. The PN and figure of merit (FoM) at 1-MHz offset are &#8722;119.2 and 192.8 dBc/Hz, respectively. The power consumption across the frequency tuning range is 5.6&#8211;10 mW.

A 27-Gb/s transceiver is implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process employing the proposed modulation. A PAM-8 transmitter is implemented on the same chip for comparison purposes. Compared to the PAM-8 modulation, the proposed SNRE-8 modulation shows an average SNR improvement of 10.6 dB at the near-end eye at the cost of 6.6% eye width reduction. With the aid of a time-domain feed-forward equalizer (FFE) and a continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE), the proposed SNRE-8 transceiver achieves a bit error rate (BER) of  $10^{-8}$  on a 9-dB loss channel with an energy efficiency of 5.39 pJ/bit.</description></item><item><title>A 26-Gb/s Framed-Pulsewidth Modulation Transceiver for Extended Reach Optical Links</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10477935</link><description>This article proposes a high-speed framed-pulsewidth modulation (FPWM) transceiver that applies a time-domain modulation scheme for increased spectrum efficiency. The achieved coding gain is 75%, indicating that the minimum pulsewidth is increased by 1.75 times compared to an NRZ scheme with an identical data rate. Such bandwidth reduction renders dispersion tolerance both in copper and optical channels. The encoder and decoder employ successive approximation (SA) and weighted sum (WS) algorithms for power-and-area efficiency. The FPWM demonstrates an 8-dB SNR gain over NRZ at 15-km single-mode fiber (SMF) transmission while maintaining identical back-to-back performance. The FPWM scheme shows 6-dB higher receiver sensitivity at a bit error rate (BER) of 2e-5 than the PAM-4 signaling in 26-Gb/s back-to-back transmission and achieves 4-dB SNR gain at 20-km transmission. The test chip is fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process and packaged in a flip-chip chip scale package (FCCSP). The test chip occupies  $2.2\times2.0$  mm, including bidirectional two lanes and two phase-locked loops (PLLs), while it consumes 262 mW per lane from a 0.9-V supply. The measured Tx random jitter is 265 fs $_{\mathrm {rms}}$ .</description></item><item><title>A Wireline Transceiver With 3-bit per Symbol Using Common-Mode NRZ and Differential-Mode PAM-4 Signaling Techniques</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10423028</link><description>This article presents a wireline transceiver using 3-bit per symbol signaling techniques that can simultaneously modulate and demodulate the common-mode (CM) 1-bit non-return to zero (NRZ) and differential-mode (DM) 2-bit pulse amplitude modulation 4 (PAM-4) signals (CMDM-8). The driver of the transmitter (TX) configured with two different types of current mode PAM-4 drivers generates CMDM-8, a mixed signal of single NRZ and differential PAM-4. If the common-mode voltage (VCM) of the two types of PAM-4 drivers is different, the VCM of the CMDM-8 signals swings between the two different VCM even if the two PAM-4 drivers generate the identical PAM-4 signal in the DM. Therefore, the TX can generate the NRZ signal in the CM while transmitting the PAM-4 signals. At the receiver (RX), the CMDM-8, which combines NRZ and PAM-4 signals, is divided into NRZ and PAM-4 signals in the analog front end. The divided analog signals are converted to the 3-bit digital data in the decoder. The 3-bit decoder recovers the NRZ and PAM-4 signals to the original data. When 2 bits are recovered from the PAM-4 signal, the VCM of the PAM-4 signal is not constant due to the residual NRZ signal. Thus, the proposed PAM-4 decoder applies an offset-based PAM-4 decoding method to achieve robustness against the VCM change. The prototype was fabricated with a 28-nm CMOS technology and had a maximum data rate of 48 Gb/s. The transceiver with an area of 0.117 mm2 enabled a bit error rate (BER) of 10 $^{-12}$  at 9.08-dB attenuation and had a power efficiency of 4.40 pJ/bit.</description></item><item><title>A Fully Integrated Multi-Phase Voltage Regulator With Flying-Capacitor-Based Inter-Inductor Current Self-Balancing Scheme and Charge-Recycling Gate Driver</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10430195</link><description>This article presents a fully integrated voltage regulator (FIVR) featuring a high power density, fast dynamic voltage scaling (DVS), and self-balanced inductor currents. The proposed two-phase 2L1C buck converter topology can 2 $\times $  reduce the number of power switches and flying capacitors (CF) compared to the conventional two-phase three-level (2P3L) converters while inheriting the benefit of a lower switching voltage. The single-CF-based self-balancing of the inductor currents with no extra overhead is a key contribution to this work. For the high scalability of the 2L1C topology, the inter-channel balancing (ICB) scheme is also presented. Moreover, the proposed charge-recycling gate driver is capable of reducing the switching power loss. The proposed two-phase FIVR chip with on-chip spiral inductors of 2 nH was fabricated in a 55-nm CMOS process.

The proposed double charging keying (DCK) uplink data modulation method assisted by a dynamic zoom control breaks the trade-off between power delivery to the load (PDL) and uplink data such that the high data-rate uplink data telemetry no longer limits the amount of PDLs. Furthermore, DCK alleviates the design difficulty in simultaneous uplink data telemetry and RR. The dynamic ZOOM-based digital control algorithm is employed to ensure reliable uplink data telemetry and rapid transient response of SIDO-RR with two  $\Delta \Sigma $ -loops under distance variations.

Battery-free communication based on wireless power transfer (WPT) can eliminate the battery to reduce the size of a wireless implant, realizing minimally invasive surgery. However, conventional battery-free implants suffer from a short communication range, such as inductive coupling, near-infrared (NIR) transmission, and active body-channel communication (BCC), which cannot apply to deep brain zones. Ultrasonic power transfer and communication benefit from a low channel loss, but the low carrier frequency leads to a low data rate, which is not able to transfer full-span neural signals such as spikes and multichannel signals. In this work, a galvanically-switching passive-BCC technique is proposed for neural implants, to extend the effective range of both power transfer and wireless communication. The brain tissue is utilized to form a galvanic loop for power delivery, while the neural-recording data switch the loop current to conduct passive BCC. The proposed technique is implemented in a neural recording chip fabricated in a 55-nm CMOS process. Through-tissue measurement shows that the chip realizes a battery-free communication range of 5.5 cm, with a bit-error rate (BER) of  $4.4 \times 10^{-6}$ . In the in-vivo demonstration, a 5.9-mm3 flexible prototype with the proposed chip inside is fully implanted into a Sprague&#8211;Dawley rat, where the neural signals are read battery-free through the passive-BCC technique.</description></item><item><title>A 125 &#956; m-Pitch-Matched Transceiver ASIC With Micro-Beamforming ADC and Multi-Level Signaling for 3-D Transfontanelle Ultrasonography</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10418877</link><description>This article presents a pitch-matched transceiver application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) for a wearable ultrasound device intended for transfontanelle ultrasonography, which includes element-level 20-V unipolar pulsers with transmit (TX) beamforming, and receive (RX) circuitry that combines eightfold multiplexing, four-channel micro-beamforming ( $\mu $ BF), and subgroup-level digitization to achieve an initial 32-fold channel-count reduction. The  $\mu $ BF is based on passive boxcar integration, merged with a 10-bit 40 MS/s SAR ADC in the charge domain, thus obviating the need for explicit anti-alias filtering (AAF) and power-hungry ADC drivers. A compact and low-power reference generator employs an area-efficient MOS capacitor as a reservoir to quickly set a reference for the ADC in the charge domain. A low-power multi-level data link, based on 16-level pulse-amplitude modulation, concatenates the outputs of four ADCs, providing an overall 128-fold channel-count reduction. A prototype transceiver ASIC was fabricated in a 180-nm BCD technology, and interfaces with a 2-D PZT transducer array of  $16\times16$  elements with a pitch of  $125 ~\mu \text{m}$  and a center frequency of 9 MHz. The ASIC consumes 1.83 mW/element. The data link achieves an aggregate 3.84 Gb/s data rate with 3.3 pJ/bit energy efficiency.

However, the number and density of the tactile sensors are limited by factors such as routing complexity, signal latency, and power consumption. Inspired by neural signal processing, we present a multichannel capacitive interface circuits that read out the sparse tactile signals in an event-driven (ED) manner. A self-reconfigurable successive-approximation-register capacitance-to-digital converter (SR SAR CDC) is proposed to reduce power consumption in passive-sampling (PS) mode and to achieve high resolution in noise-shaping (NS) mode. To support parallel recording in NS data converters, we propose a 2 $^{N}$  oversampling-rate (2 $^{N}$ -OSR) code division multiplexing (CDM) technique. Besides, an ED inter-integrated circuit (ED-I2C) protocol is proposed to reduce communication data burden and routing complexity.

Though integral (INT) CIM chips are emerging, the floating-point (FP) CIM chip has not been well explored. The high-accuracy demand of larger models and complex tasks requires FP computation. Besides, most of the neural network (NN) training tasks still rely on FP computation. This work presents an energy-efficient FP CIM processor. It is observed that most of the exponent values of FP data are concentrated in a small region. Therefore, the FP computations are divided into intensive and sparse parts and then executed on an intensive-CIM sparse-digital architecture. First, an FP-to-INT CIM workflow for the intensive FP operations is designed to reduce the CIM execution cycles. Second, a flexible sparse-digital core is proposed for the remaining sparse FP operations. Utilizing both the intensive-CIM and sparse-digital cores, this work can achieve both high energy efficiency and identical accuracy to the FP algorithm baseline. Considering the FP CIM execution flow, a CIM-friendly low-bit FP training method is proposed to further reduce the execution cycles. Besides, a low-MAC-value (MACV) CIM macro is designed to utilize the more random sparsity brought by FP alignment. The 28-nm fabricated chip shows 275&#8211;1615-TOPS/W@INT4 and 17.2&#8211;91.3-TOPS/W@FP16 macro energy efficiency from dense to the average sparsity on the tested models.</description></item><item><title>RoboVisio: A Micro-Robot Vision Domain-Specific SoC for Autonomous Navigation Enabling Fully-on-Chip Intelligence via 2-MB eMRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10445424</link><description>This article presents RoboVisio, an efficient and highly flexible domain-specific system-on-chip (SoC) for vision tasks in fully autonomous micro-robot navigation.

Combining both processing schemes into a single PE array future-proofs the architecture, facilitating next-generation CNN-heavy vision algorithms, while saving 40% area and leakage with no power overhead and throughput loss, compared with two separate array implementations. To further improve energy and area efficiency, the design incorporates a number of key features: 1) 2-MB magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM) for non-volatile fully-on-chip weight storage; 2) a unified image-activation memory (IAMEM) with block-swapping-based input/output image buffering that reduces buffer footprint by 50% and eliminates data copy for multi-frame buffering; and 3) a combination of weight buffering and CNN loop ordering that reduces weight memory system power by 75%. Fabricated in 22-nm CMOS, the design achieves 0.22 nJ/pixels for Harris corner feature detection (a classic or non-CNN vision task) and 3.5 TOPS/W (16-bit OP) for CNN, a 40%&#8211;170% efficiency improvement over state-of-the-art edge machine learning (ML) SoCs using non-volatile memory (NVM).</description></item><item><title>FlexSpin: A CMOS Ising Machine With 256 Flexible Spin Processing Elements With 8-b Coefficients for Solving Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10412172</link><description>Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are essential in various applications, including data clustering, supply chain management, and communication networks. Many real-world COPs are non-deterministic polynomial-time hard problems intractable using classical computers. Ising machine, the hardware accelerator based on the Ising model and annealing operation, has gained much attention as an alternative for solving COPs. The COPs are mapped to the Ising model, and their optimal/near-optimal solutions are explored by the intrinsic convergence property of the Ising machine. However, prior Ising machines based on locally connected spins have limitations in solving hard COPs due to significant overhead while mapping the Ising model to the inflexible hardware topology. In this work, we propose a scalable CMOS Ising machine with a network of flexible processing elements (PEs) to map and solve complex COPs with minimal overhead.

However, implementing ODL on battery-limited edge devices poses significant challenges due to the generation of large-size intermediate data during ML training and the frequent data movement between the processor and memory, resulting in substantial power consumption. To address this limitation, certain ML accelerators in edge devices have adopted a processing-in-memory (PIM) paradigm, integrating computing logic into memory. Nevertheless, these accelerators still face hurdles such as long latency caused by the lack of a pipelined approach in the training process, notable power and area overheads related to floating-point arithmetic, and incomplete handling of data sparsity during training. This article presents a high-throughput super-pipelined PIM accelerator, named SP-PIM, designed to overcome the limitations of existing PIM-based ODL accelerators. To this end, SP-PIM implements a holistic multi-level pipelining scheme based on local error prediction (EP), enhancing training speed by 7.31 $\times $ . In addition, SP-PIM introduces a local EP unit (LEPU), a lightweight circuit that performs accurate EP leveraging power-of-two (PoT) random weights. This strategy significantly reduces power-hungry external memory access (EMA) by 59.09%. Moreover, SP-PIM fully exploits sparsities in both activation and error data during training, facilitated by a highly optimized PIM macro design. Finally, the SP-PIM chip, fabricated using 28-nm CMOS technology, achieves a training speed of 8.81 epochs/s. It occupies a die area of 5.76 mm2 and consumes between 6.91 and 433.25 mW at operating frequencies of 20&#8211;450 MHz with a supply voltage of 0.56&#8211;1.05 V. We demonstrate that it can successfully execute end-to-end ODL for the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets. Consequently, it achieves state-of-the-art area efficiency (560.6 GFLOPS/mm2) and competitive power efficiency (22.4 TFLOPS/W), marking a 3.95 $\times $  higher figure-of-merit (area efficiency  $\times $  power efficiency  $\times $  capacity) than previous work. Furthermore, we implemented a cycle-level simulator using Python to investigate and validate the scalability of SP-PIM. By doing architectural experiments in various hardware configurations, we successfully verified that the core computing unit within SP-PIM possesses both scale-up and scale-out capabilities.</description></item><item><title>iMCU: A 28-nm Digital In-Memory Computing-Based Microcontroller Unit for TinyML</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10436137</link><description>Tiny machine learning (TinyML) envisions executing a deep neural network (DNN)-based inference on an edge device for improving battery life, latency, security, and privacy. Toward this vision, recent microcontroller units (MCUs) integrate in-memory computing (IMC) hardware to leverage its high energy efficiency and throughput in vector&#8211;matrix multiplication (VMM). However, those existing works require large IMC hardware, severely increasing the area overhead. In addition, most existing works use analog&#8211;mixed-signal (AMS) IMC hardware, exhibiting limited robustness over process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Finally, none can support a practical software development framework such as TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TFLite-micro). Due to these limitations, those MCUs did not present the performance for the standard benchmark MLPerf-Tiny, which makes it difficult to evaluate them against the state-of-the-art neural (not necessarily IMC-based) MCUs. In this article, we design a new IMC-based MCU, titled iMCU, for TinyML to address those challenges. In the design process, we: 1) define the optimal set of acceleration targets and 2) devise an area-efficient computation flow that requires the least amount of IMC hardware yet still provides a significant acceleration. In addition, we develop: 1) state-of-the-art digital IMC macros and 2) create the accelerator based on the macros, which can support the proposed computation flow in a fully pipelined manner. Combining those innovations, we prototyped the iMCU in a 28-nm CMOS. The measurement results show that the iMCU significantly outperforms the prior IMC-based MCUs in compute density, energy efficiency, and SRAM density (total SRAM size/total SRAM area). It also achieves a compact footprint of 2.73 mm2.</description></item><item><title>Scaling-CIM: eDRAM In-Memory-Computing Accelerator With Dynamic-Scaling ADC and Adaptive Analog Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10438359</link><description>This article presents Scaling-computing-in-memory (CIM), an energy-efficient embedded dynamic random access memory (eDRAM)-based in-memory-computing (IMC) accelerator with a dynamic-scaling readout for signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) boosting and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) overhead reduction.

The proposed ACAID autonomously increases the supply current at the onset of the tracking phase, achieving a high slew rate. As the driver output voltage gradually follows the input signal in the RC-settling or hold phase, the supply current successively diminishes back to the original low quiescent level. The required sensing and actuating circuits for current adaptation are inherent components in the adopted capacitive feedback topology. A prototype version of the proposed ACAID has been designed and fabricated in a  $0.35\thinspace \mu {\mathrm { m}}$  CMOS process, along with integrated charge programming circuits and a 10-bit successive approximation register ADC. With  $0.5\thinspace {\mathrm { pF}}$  sampling capacitors loading the driver, the proposed ACAID achieves  $-70.1\thinspace {\mathrm { dB}}$  total harmonic distortion (THD) with a  $100\thinspace {\mathrm { kHz}}$  input signal with  $2.8V_{\mathrm { pp}}$  amplitude. When connected to an on-chip ADC with a  $200\thinspace {\mathrm { kHz}}$  sampling rate, the measured effective number of bits (ENoB) near the Nyquist rate is 9.1. The proposed ACAID saves more power as the input frequency increases or when the portion of the tracking period reduces. The prototyped driver circuit can save 49.5% power consumption when the input frequency is  $100\thinspace {\mathrm { kHz}}$  with a 10% duty cycle for tracking.

Within the IDAC, a reference voltage is driven to resistor legs, obtaining an accurate current with high Rout. A  $1^{\mathrm {st}}$  order loop filter utilizes an inherently linear, zero-static-power, passive integrator. An isolation of the integrator from external sensor capacitance is obtained by a cascode transistor, enabling the use of the passive integrator. During the Zoom&#8217;s SAR phase, a binary search detects the approximate signal level and provides zoomed references for the Sigma-Delta phase, where fine conversion is performed. The dynamic mode tracks the comparator output data to determine when the input signal is close to the references and updates them accordingly. This paper is the first to propose a dynamic zoom ADC which utilizes a single DAC. An over-voltage detector detects integrator voltages exceeding the supply level, a result of high input currents, and prevents damage to the circuit. A 65nm implementation achieved a competitive dynamic range of 125dB, an SNR of 91dB and an FoM of 192dB. The design occupies 0.08 mm2, and a state-of-the-art power consumption of 11.4uW was measured. The dynamic mode supports up to 78Hz inputs, and an SFDR of 90.4dB was measured.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Memristor Based Distributed Decision Tree Circuit for Cybersecurity Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10537617</link><description>Cybersecurity at the edge requires fast computing in energy-constrained environments. Decision trees can provide an explainable solution for network intrusion detection with high detection accuracy at the packet level. However, their hardware implementation needs to support efficient real-time operation. In this paper, we propose a spatially distributed decision tree for network intrusion detection, using memristor-based chiplet leaves. Each chiplet processes an input by comparing it to a predefined boundary stored in the memristor cell and provides a binary output to select one of the interconnected leaves on the lower level, with an estimated power consumption in a 130nm node design of  $389~\mu $ W. The delay is  $2.5~\mu $ s for one inference decision. This chiplet approach is reconfigurable and in line with the natural architecture of decision trees. It also supports the prototyping with known good dies, overcoming the non-idealities challenge prevalent in memristor technologies. Our memristor-based decision trees show high intrusion detection accuracy of 82%, 84%, and 73% on the benchmark UNSW, CIC-IDS, and ACI-IoT datasets respectively, considering 6-bit device precision in one memristor vs. three memristor per boundary configurations. This distributed approach opens the way to utilizing memristor technology despite device defects for applications in need of local real-time computing.</description></item><item><title>A 50-Gb/s PAM-4 Receiver With Adaptive Phase-Shifting CDR in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10516468</link><description>This paper presents a 50-Gb/s receiver (RX) with an adaptive phase-shifting (APS) phase detector (PD) for four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) clock and data recovery (CDR). The APS PD adopts a  $\beta $  detector to achieve a unique locking point that resolves the dead-zone problem caused by the combination of the conventional baud-rate PD and adaptive decision feedback equalizer (DFE). The APS CDR is configured with a sign-sign minimum mean squared error (SS-MMSE) PD and an addition of a digital coefficient which is adaptively controlled through the  $\beta $  detector by detecting pre-cursor inter-symbol interference (ISI) dependency of 1-level transitions. Therefore, the proposed CDR does not rely on external coefficients. Furthermore, adaptive programmable gain amplifiers (PGAs) and DFE are implemented with the APS CDR to compensate the pre and post-cursor ISIs, and main-cursor level. Since the adaptive equalizers and the APS CDR share the error samplers, no additional analog hardware is required. Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS technology, a prototype PAM-4 RX operates at 50 Gb/s and occupies an active area of 0.16 mm2. The RX tested over a 25.3-dB loss channel achieves a bit error rate (BER) of less than  $10^{-12}$  and energy efficiency of 2.52 pJ/b.</description></item><item><title>A 0.6 V, 1.74 mW, 2.9 dB NF Inductorless Wideband LNA in 28-nm CMOS Exploiting Noise Cancellation and Current Reuse</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10557511</link><description>This paper proposes an inductorless wideband common-gate (CG)-common-source (CS) noise-cancelling (NC) low-noise amplifier (LNA) with current reuse (CR) for ultra-low voltage (ULV) application. In the conventional NC LNA with CR, to reuse the DC current of the auxiliary amplifier, three transistors are stacked in a single branch, leading to a reduced voltage headroom. Moreover, additional inductor and capacitors are required, resulting in a large silicon area. In the proposed work, the DC current of the auxiliary amplifier can be reused without using any inductor. Meanwhile, only two transistors are stacked in a single branch, making it suitable for ULV application.

The design procedure relies on a modified analytical role-exchange Doherty-Chireix continuum theory which doubles the design space for the realization of high-efficiency PAs with a mode of operation continuously changing between the Chireix mode and two role-exchange hybrid Doherty-Chireix outphasing modes as the frequency varies up and down, respectively. Using this theory, a mixed-mode CM-OPA with constant output power back-off level and constant saturated power is developed. The CM-OPA theory is first verified at the current-source reference planes for a frequency range from 1.3 GHz to 2.0 GHz for a GaN HEMT. The proposed CM-OPA is then implemented at the package reference planes using the embedding model to synthesize the combiner circuit across the entire frequency bandwidth. The 1.3 to 2.0 GHz bandwidth-enhanced CM-OPA was fabricated and characterized using both continuous-wave and modulated signals. When driven by a 20-MHz LTE signal with 7.1 dB peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR), the proposed CM-OPA achieves better than -45 dBc adjacent channel leakage ratio (ACLR) and higher than 44% power-added efficiency (PAE) after digital predistortion linearization at 1.3/1.6/1.8 GHz.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Design of a Sub-Sampling PLL of Low Phase Noise and Low Reference Spur</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10489983</link><description>This paper presents an analog low-power sub-sampling phase locked loop (PLL) that tackles the reference spur caused by VCO load modulation from the sub-sampling operation.

Histogramming is a common technique employed to detect, analyze, and store enormous volumes of data in real-time, making it useful for industrial applications in fields such as biology, chemistry, medical imaging, and spectroscopy. Due for them programming simplicity and low-cost large amount of memory, general-purpose temporal computing processors are commonly used, but they lack the ability to perform parallel computation at high-performance. Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is a powerful parallel computing solution proposed by both the scientific and industrial worlds, but it is equipped with little memory for these applications. Thus, a hybrid spatial/temporal computing histogram generator has been proposed, which uses a low-area multi-channel histogramming engine in programmable logic which is expanded thanks to an external Double Data Rate Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (DDR) driven by a MicroBlaze Soft Processor Core.

However, further improvements in computing energy efficiency are still desirable for resource-constrained conditions and practical applications. Therefore, in this work, a memristive analog transiently chaotic neural network (TCNN) system is proposed to solve the traveling salesman problems (TSPs), which is consisted of 1) a memristor array to perform matrix-vector multiplication for the network iteration; 2) neuronal modules and nonlinear activation function modules to emulate the basic functions of the network; 3) chaotic simulated annealing (CSA) modules to improve the solution performance at extremely low hardware overhead. Based on these, after mapping the TSPs onto the memristor array, the proposed TCNN can self-iterate to convergence states to solve the problems with high performance. Compared to prior analog-digital mixed ones, the analog system can eliminate the extra control and data conversions during the network solving process, and achieve an  $8\times $  reduction in the total energy consumption in consecutive solving tasks.</description></item><item><title>Quantification of Cascading Failure Propagation in Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10497182</link><description>This paper studies cascading failure propagation in power systems and presents methods for the quantification of important properties of failure propagation.

Its hardware realization is challenging due to the complex exponential and reciprocal operations. Existing studies applied piecewise models to approximate sigmoid function and employed numerical methods or non-uniform input segmentations to mitigate fitting inaccuracies. However, the breakpoints introduce inevitable approximation precision loss. Besides, additional fitting processes greatly increase hardware complexity and power consumption. This paper presents a hardware-friendly sigmoidal approximation from the perspective of probability theory. We find that for a given input, the output of a sigmoid function can be approximated by the probability that the sum of this input and a Gaussian random variable is greater than or equal to zero. As the derived theorem does not involve piecewise expressions, the precision loss caused by the breakpoint issue is avoided. A low-complexity binary-search-based address localization method is proposed to optimize our theorem for hardware implementation. For the optimized scheme, an efficient implemented circuit is also presented. Our scheme&#8217;s approximation ability and hardware efficiency are validated through software modeling and FPGA- and ASIC-based experiments. Feedforward neural network-based classification applications demonstrate that building networks with the proposed sigmoid approximator has only a tiny recognition rate loss.</description></item><item><title>Stabilization of Noisy Sampled-Data Networked Control Systems: Application to Interleaved Flyback Modular Integrated Converter Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10485572</link><description>This paper is concerned with noisy sampled-data networked control systems with stochastic network-induced delays and noisy sampling intervals using a stochastic discrete integral quadratic constraint (DIQC) approach.

Due to its inherent ability of voltage amplification, the transformer-based voltage-multiplier becomes prevalent in step-up converters which are the inevitable parts in the usage of low-voltage renewable resources. Though its feasibility has been verified in many researches, an uncertain error in voltage conversion ratio exists between the reality and ideal, which leaves a theoretical gap. Accordingly, the key affecting characteristics, the reverse recovery process of the leakage inductance, is considered and analyzed in this paper.

In this regard, emerging RRAMs have attracted considerable interest for their unique qualities like low power consumption, high integration potential, durability, and CMOS compatibility. Using RRAMs to imitate the more analog storage behavior of brain synapses is also a promising strategy for further improving memory density and power efficiency. However, RRAM devices display strong stochastic behavior, together with relaxation effects, making it more challenging to precisely control their multi-level storage capability. To address this, researchers have reported different multi-level programming strategies, mostly involving the precise control of analog parameters like compliance current during write operations and/or programming voltage amplitudes. Here, we present a new fully digital relaxation-aware method for tuning the conductance of analog RRAMs. The method is based on modulating digital pulse widths during erase operations while keeping other parameters fixed, and therefore requires no precise alterations to analog parameters like compliance currents or programming voltage amplitudes. Experimental results, with and without relaxation effect awareness, on a 64 RRAM 1T1R HfOx memory array of cells, fabricated in 130nm CMOS technology, indicate that it is possible to obtain 2-bit memory per cell multi-value storage at the array level, verified 1000 seconds after programming.</description></item><item><title>An Inductance-Variation-Insensitive Buck Converter Using a Dynamic Ramp Compensation With Slope Sensing Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10462485</link><description>This brief introduces a current-mode DC-DC buck converter that operates without performance degradations, even when the inductance value changes. The proposed circuit can be widely utilized to ensure the stable operation of various systems, as inductor values in PMICs may fluctuate despite being identical components. The proposed Inductance-Variation-Insensitive (IVI) buck converter directly senses the rate of change of inductor current and transmits information about the output voltage and inductance to a dynamic ramp generator. The dynamic ramp generator produces a ramp signal proportionate to the sensed inductor current slope, thereby maintaining a deadbeat state and preventing subharmonic oscillations. This innovative approach enables the converter to function seamlessly across a wide range of output values while maintaining overall stability.

It consists of a common-source transistor and a passive impedance network whose order can be increased via a passive-impedance-network extension. To increase bandwidth and reduce circuit area, the network inductors are reduced by a factor of  $\boldsymbol {N^{2}}$ , where  $\boldsymbol {N}$  is the Norton-transformation coefficient. The viability of the topology is experimentally demonstrated with a single-stage 5th-order APF, which exhibits a delay of 75 ps with a 10% bandwidth from 0 to 16.4 GHz. The 65-nm-CMOS 5th-order APF occupies only 0.046 mm2 and draws 1.92 mA from a 1.3-V supply.</description></item><item><title>Compact Quadruple-Mode FSIW Filtering Power Divider With High Isolation Using Embedded Capacitive Isolation Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10453320</link><description>In this brief, a new compact filtering power divider (FPD) with high isolation utilizing embedded capacitive isolation network (CIN) is proposed, which is based on the quadruple-mode folded substrate integrated waveguide (FSIW) resonator. The dual-mode stepped-impedance stub-loaded resonator (SISLR) is the first embedded in the closed dual-mode FSIW to achieve the quadruple-mode resonator with reduced size. In addition, the CIN containing two interdigital capacitors is embedded in two hybrid resonators, which greatly improves the isolation of output ports as well as further effectively reduces the size of the FPD. In final, a prototype with 3-dB fractional bandwidth of 15.2% is designed and fabricated at 4.98 GHz ( $f_{0}$ ), and its insertion loss is 1.47 dB. The isolation and upper-stopband rejection are better than 25.2 dB, and 20 dB extended to  $1.97f_{0}$ , respectively. It occupies only 0.26  $\lambda_{g}^{2}$ , where  $\lambda_{g}$  is the guided wavelength at  $f_{0}$ .</description></item><item><title>A Digitally Controlled Bidirectional 24&#8211;32-GHz Variable Gain Phase Shifter in 45-nm SOI CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10466373</link><description>This brief presents a novel topology for a bidirectional variable gain phase shifter (VGPS) circuit. The proposed VGPS circuit includes an in-phase-power-splitting stage that evenly divides the input signal. These two resulting signals are then directed into two separate phase-only tunable components achieved through phase shifters (PSs). Careful selection of specific phase settings for the two PSs yields the desired overall gain and phase shift when their outputs are combined. The operational principle and theoretical analysis of the proposed VGPS circuit are provided. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed topology, a VGPS circuit demonstrator was implemented using 45 nm Silicon-on-Insulator CMOS technology. The demonstrator incorporates two reflection-type phase shifters and non-isolated splitters/combiners at the input/output, fitting within a compact area of  $0.179~mm^{2}$ . Measurement results reveal excellent gain and phase tuning ranges of 20 dB (ranging from -7.5 dB to -27.5 dB) and 360&#176;, respectively. Moreover, the demonstrator maintains precise control over phase and gain ranges with a tuning step of 5.6&#176;/1 dB while ensuring total root mean square phase and gain errors remain below 1.6&#176; and 0.25 dB, respectively, across a bandwidth spanning 24-32 GHz.</description></item><item><title>A 100-MHz High-Efficiency Cross-Coupled Stacked Rectifier in Isolated DC&#8211;DC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10466661</link><description>A 100-MHz high-efficiency cross-coupled stacked rectifier in an isolated power transfer system is presented.

The unique design approach involves segmenting the flipping stages, enabling the FI-SSHIC to execute 17 phase flips utilizing merely a diminutive inductor of  $5\mu \text{H}$  and 8 compact capacitors. By circumventing the traditional full bridge rectifier (FBR) and streamlining the switch count, this brief&#8217;s flipping efficiency soars to an impressive 96.3%. When juxtaposed with SSHC and SSHI, utilizing identical capacitor and inductor dimensions, our design yields a 15.1% and 59.3% enhancement in output power, respectively.

The augmented complex-valued minimum error entropy with fiducial points (ACMEEF) adaptive algorithm has achieved good estimation for power system frequency. However, it only considers the clean input signals. For noisy inputs, the ACMEEF algorithm will yield a biased estimation. To solve this problem, the augmented complex-valued minimum total error entropy with fiducial points (ACMTEEF) algorithm is proposed in this brief, which incorporates the MEEF criterion into the framework of total least squares (TLS) and performs well for noisy input and impulsive noise disturbance. In addition, the proposed ACMTEEF algorithm can still estimate the system frequency accurately under three-phase unbalance. Then, the theoretical performance of the ACMTEEF algorithm is analyzed, and the superiority of the ACMTEEF algorithm is demonstrated through simulation experiments.</description></item><item><title>Linearization of Load Mismatched Power Amplifiers Using Reflection-Aware Augmented Polynomial Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10466712</link><description>Wireless transmitters are affected by the reflection caused by an impedance mismatch between the power amplifier&#8217;s (PA) output and the antenna&#8217;s input. Isolators can lessen the output mismatch of the PA, but they add the bulk to the transmitter. A reflection-aware augmented PA modeling and Digital Predistortion (DPD) technique are proposed to reduce the influence of the dynamic varying reflection due to the output-load mismatch and the PA&#8217;s nonlinearities. This Augmented model includes a term that characterizes the mismatched effect. The proposed DPD with a single set of coefficients is robust and can mitigate the dynamic varying output-load mismatch with the PA nonlinearity.</description></item><item><title>A Hash-Based Clustering System Software for Intermittent Computing Devices With NAND Flash Memory</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10477547</link><description>In recent years, the intermittent computing devices have become increasingly widespread and result in a greater demand for storage space. In particular, NAND flash memory is well-suited as a storage medium for the intermittent computing devices, but its &#8220;out-of-place&#8221; update characteristic leads to a garbage collection (GC) mechanism to reclaim invalid pages when the number of free pages becomes insufficient. The previous studies have shown that a suitable separation of hot and cold data (i.e., a clustering method) can significantly reduce the overhead of GC and improve the performance. However, the previous studies are not suitable for the intermittent computing devices that are equipped with the limited volatile memory space and very low-computing power. Therefore, we will propose a hash-based clustering system software for the intermittent computing devices to provide a suitable separation of hot and cold data. The experimental results show that the proposed method with low-computational time and low-volatile memory space can achieve a reduction of 8%&#8211;10%, 8%&#8211;10%, 10%, and 5%&#8211;7%, in page reads, page writes, block erases, average number of erases per block, and a reduction of 8%&#8211;11% in write amplification when compared to the previous methods (such as a DBSCAN-based clustering method and a K-means clustering method). Additionally, the proposed method can efficiently recover to the most recent state when the intermittent computing devices experience power outages.</description></item><item><title>DRAM-Based Acceleration of Open Modification Search in Hyperdimensional Space</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10484999</link><description>Mass spectrometry, commonly used for protein identification, generates a massive number of spectra that need to be matched against a large database. In reality, most of them remain unidentified or mismatched due to unexpected post-translational modifications. Open modification search (OMS) has been proposed as a strategy to improve the identification rate by considering changes in spectra, but it expands the search space exponentially. In this work, we propose HyperOMS, an algorithm-hardware co-design for boosted OMS, to cope with the enlarged database and expanded search space. HyperOMS encodes spectral data into binary vectors and performs the efficient OMS in high-dimensional space. We accelerate the HyperOMS algorithm using a DRAM-based processing-in-memory accelerator, which combines processing-using-memory and near-memory processing technologies. In order to maximize the parallelization and efficiency of the accelerator, we optimize the data allocation and devise an approximation strategy for similarity computation. Experimental results show that the HyperOMS accelerator yields up to  $3.8\times $  speedup and  $119\times $  higher energy efficiency compared to running HyperOMS on GPU, and up to  $99\times $  speedup and  $1984\times $  higher energy efficiency over the state-of-the-art OMS tool, ANN-SoLo (Bittremieux et al., 2019), while providing comparable search quality to competing tools.</description></item><item><title>Delaying Crash Consistency for Building A High-Performance Persistent Memory File System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10466391</link><description>Persistent memory (PM), with its low-latency, byte-addressability, and nonvolatility, sparks various PM file systems. Nevertheless, we observe that these file systems can waste more than 50% PM I/O bandwidth, hindering the value of PM. Our in-depth analysis reveals that this can be rooted in their strong consistency assumptions that require synchronized PM I/O for strict data integrity. Nevertheless, these I/Os, including attribute updates, space management, and journaling, are generally small, random, and fail to match with the PM I/O characteristics. We present HUNTER, a POSIX-compliant PM file system that aims to unleash PM I/O performance with strict data integrity. Our key insight is delaying crash consistency with emerging flush-on-fail (FoF) hardware. We achieve this insight by first leveraging a PM-simplified soft update mechanism to persist metadata (i.e., consistent view) in the background; while maintaining up-to-date states in DRAM (i.e., latest view) for instantaneous user responding. Compared to prior works, HUNTER carefully decouples the latest view from the consistent view, and thus, background operations will not block the foreground paths, which fully exploits soft update efficiency. Under this architecture, FoF hardware allows a residual energy window for state synchronization during system failures. However, ensuring strict data integrity is still nontrivial due to existing deficient sync mechanisms that might either hide the benefits of soft update or fail to flush all states during the FoF window. We propose collaborated synchronization that bridges the two views to minimize PM I/O to address the issue. Our extensive experiments show that HUNTER can achieve 1.35&#8211; $7.51\times $  I/O throughput compared to existing PM file systems. Under the strict workload configurations, HUNTER outperforms the fastest PM file system by 72%&#8211;122%.</description></item><item><title>A Task-Adaptive In-Situ ReRAM Computing for Graph Convolutional Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10463614</link><description>ReRAM-based computing-in-memory (CiM) architecture has been considered a promising solution to high-efficiency neural network accelerator, by conducting in-situ matrix multiplications and eliminating the movement of neural parameters from off-chip memory to computing units. However, we observed specific features of graph convolutional network (GCN) tasks pose design challenges to implement a high-efficiency ReRAM GCN accelerator. The ultralarge input feature data in some GCN tasks incur massive data movements, the extremely sparse adjacency matrix and input feature data involve the valid computation, and the super-large adjacency matrix that exceeds available ReRAM capacity causes frequent expensive write operations. To address the above challenges, we propose TARe, a task-adaptive CiM architecture, which consists of a hybrid in-situ computing mode to support the input feature in crossbar computing, a compact mapping scheme for efficient sparse matrix computing, and a write-free mapping to eliminate write activities in the computations with the super-large adjacency matrix. Additionally, TARe is facilitated with a task adaptive selection algorithm to generate optimized design schemes for graph neural network (GNN) tasks that have various operand sizes and data sparsity. We evaluate TARe on 11 diverse GNN tasks and compare it with different design counterparts, and the results show that achieves 168.06 $\times $  speedup and 10.95 $\times $  energy consumption reduction on average over the baseline in common GCN workloads.</description></item><item><title>FireFly v2: Advancing Hardware Support for High-Performance Spiking Neural Network With a Spatiotemporal FPGA Accelerator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478105</link><description>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are expected to be a promising alternative to artificial neural networks (ANNs) due to their strong biological interpretability and high energy efficiency. Specialized SNN hardware offers clear advantages over general-purpose devices in terms of power and performance. However, there is still room to advance hardware support for state-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN algorithms and improve computation and memory efficiency. As a further step in supporting high-performance SNNs on specialized hardware, we introduce FireFly v2, an field-programmable gate array (FPGA) SNN accelerator that can address the issue of nonspike operation in current SOTA SNN algorithms, which presents an obstacle in the end-to-end deployment onto existing SNN hardware. To more effectively align with the SNN characteristics, we design a spatiotemporal dataflow that allows four dimensions of parallelism and eliminates the need for membrane potential storage, enabling on-the-fly spike processing and spike generation. To further improve hardware acceleration performance, we develop a high-performance spike computing engine as a backend based on a systolic array operating at 500&#8211;600 MHz. To the best of our knowledge, FireFly v2 achieves the highest clock frequency among all FPGA-based implementations. Furthermore, it stands as the first SNN accelerator capable of supporting nonspike operations, which are commonly used in advanced SNN algorithms. FireFly v2 has doubled the throughput and DSP efficiency when compared to our previous version of FireFly and it exhibits  $\times 1.33$  the DSP efficiency and  $\times 1.42$  the power efficiency compared to the current most advanced FPGA accelerators.</description></item><item><title>Randomized Cholesky Factorization With Threshold-Based Multisampling for Power Grid Simulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10478099</link><description>Transient simulation of large power grids (PGs) can be extremely challenging because linear equation systems with millions of unknowns need to be solved at each time step. The iterative equation solvers can be more scalable and efficient than direct solvers, thanks to the preconditioning approaches. Recently, randomized Cholesky factorization (RChol) was proposed, showing promising performance in preconditioning symmetric diagonally dominant M-matrices (SDDMs). However, it does not allow to include more fill-ins, making it less flexible and less efficient in problems like PG transient simulation. In this work, a RChol with a threshold-based multisampling strategy (RCholT) is proposed. RCholT allows to control the sparsity of preconditioners by a user-defined threshold and can construct more effective preconditioners than RChol. As the result, the RCholT-based transient simulator is  $1.7\times $  faster than the RChol-based one and  $2.3\times $  faster than the graph sparsification-based one on SDDM and PG benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Fast Constraints Tuning via Transfer Learning and Multiobjective Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10472311</link><description>As the complexity of very-large-scale integration (VLSI) increases, empirically determining the design constraints necessary to achieve the optimal power, performance, and area (PPA) within the electronic design automation (EDA) workflow becomes more challenging. Design space exploration is capable of effectively and automatically identifying the design constraints required to attain the optimal PPA in VLSI designs. However, the absence of prior knowledge can lead to less efficient explorations. This article proposes a novel fast constraint tuning framework via transfer learning and multiobjective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) to find the optimal design constraints. First, we introduce transfer learning into MOBO by Gaussian Copula and transform the PPA data into residual observations. We propose to transfer the prior information of the implemented technologies to the advanced technology to optimize the parameter design space under the advanced technology. Second, we propose Gaussian process regression with an auto-encoder-based deep kernel as a surrogate model in MOBO. The auto-encoder-based deep kernel can extract more input features to make the surrogate model more precise. We employ the batch uncertainty-aware search acquisition function to improve exploration efficiency. Using this surrogate model and this acquisition function in MOBO can reduce the amount that EDA tools need to run. The average EDA tools running times of the proposed model is 204, and the average ADRS is 0.0373. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, experiments on a CPU design reveal that a higher-quality Pareto frontier can be provided with a shorter running time.</description></item><item><title>On Legalization of Die Bonding Bumps and Pads for 3-D ICs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10485210</link><description>As state-of-the-art 3-D IC place-and-route flows were designed with older technology nodes and aggressive bonding pitch assumptions, they introduce an unacceptable number of 3-D via overlap violations during routing in real-world scenarios. Specifically, when dealing with higher via pitch to wire size ratios using more advanced technology nodes than they were designed for, these flows struggle to comply with width and spacing rules. In this article, we propose a novel 3-D via legalization stage and a subsequent refinement stage during routing to address this issue. Two independent via legalization methods are introduced: a force-based algorithm and a bipartite-matching algorithm with Bayesian optimization. Our two legalization methods, along with the refinement stage, are compatible with various process nodes, bonding technologies, and partitioning styles. By implementing the modified 3-D routing with the proposed legalizers, we successfully eliminate all 3-D via overlap violations while minimizing the impact on performance, power, or area.</description></item><item><title>SPADIX: A Highly Efficient Accelerator for Solving 3-D Partial Differential Equations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10480702</link><description>Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) holds immense significance in numerous scientific and engineering fields. While analytical solutions to PDEs are often restricted to simple cases, numerical methods offer powerful techniques to approximate solutions for complex PDEs. Previous works have proposed customized accelerators to address the compute- and memory-intensive aspects of numerical PDE solvers. However, these approaches primarily focus on 2-D PDEs and encounter challenges in scaling to support 3-D PDEs due to increased complexity and computational demands. In this article, we introduce Spadix, a highly efficient hardware accelerator designed for numerical 3-D PDE solvers. Spadix leverages a customized processing element (PE) array architecture specifically tailored to the compute and data access patterns in 3-D PDEs. The PE incorporates techniques such as temporal and spatial data reuse to minimize data accesses, enhancing overall performance and energy efficiency. Additionally, Spadix supports the checkerboard method for numerical PDE solvers, which exhibits a faster convergence rate compared to the Jacobi method without compromising parallelism. Our evaluation demonstrates that Spadix achieves an average  $8.4\times $  speedup with  $9.2\times $  energy reduction over NVIDIA RTX3090 GPU and a  $9.7\times $  speedup with  $3.2\times $  energy reduction over Alrescha, the state-of-the-art PDE-solving accelerator.</description></item></channel></rss>
