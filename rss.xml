To solve this problem, in this article, an inherent switching reallocated CPS-PWM is proposed for MMC. Based on arm current directions, switching states of submodules (SMs), voltage sorting and carrier sorting results, proposed method divides SMs and carriers into inserting and bypassing groups for each, enabling switching reallocation within these four cooptimized groups to inherently balance capacitor voltages. This effectively prevents additional switchings. Besides, most computations of the proposed CPS-PWM are logical operations implemented in FPGA, so proposed method can achieve reallocation frequency equal to sampling frequency. Unlike other CPS-PWM based methods for voltage balancing, the inherent switching reallocated CPS-PWM not only has superior converge speed in dynamic processes which accommodate a wide power range, but also has excellent balancing accuracy especially considering capacitance differences. Owing to appropriate reallocation principles, the proposed CPS-PWM has lower switching loss compared to existing carrier reallocation methods. Finally, the feasibility and superiority of the proposed method are validated by simulation and experiment results.</description></item><item><title>Current Sensor-Less Dead Time Distortion Compensation in Three-Phase PWM Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003407</link><description>Dead-time distortion is a typical problem in pulse width modulation (PWM) voltage source inverter (VSI). Accuracy in current polarity detection is a major issue in implementing dead-time distortion compensation successfully. This article proposes a power function-based current sensor-less dead-time distortion compensation technique in three-phase PWM VSI. The power function, when developed by applying instantaneous power theory (IPT) directly, may not be able to detect the current polarity accurately. This has been investigated in detail in this article. In the proposed technique, this problem is overcome by sensing and utilizing the pole voltage of the inverter and developing the power function for each phase using IPT with significant modification to make it applicable to each phase individually. There is no requirement of topological modification or additional hardware in the power circuit for implementing such compensation. This reduces the overall cost and complexity of the set-up. The scheme is capable of automatically correcting the dead-time distortion, even in case of online load change. The attractive feature of this scheme is its simple principle, allowing it to be implemented in low-cost digital controllers. Validation of the proposed compensation technique is executed in digital simulation and through experiments in laboratory.</description></item><item><title>Small-Signal Behavioral Model and Voltage Control Parameter Optimization for MMC Considering Internal Dynamics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10969575</link><description>The modular multilevel converter (MMC) has become a pivotal solution for renewable energy integration and HVdc transmission systems credited to its modular scalability, high efficiency, and low distortion. Nevertheless, the intricate internal dynamics, including circulating current and submodule capacitor voltage dynamics, have a significant impact on its control performance. To address this issue, this article proposes a novel equivalent impedance circuit model that incorporates coupled circulating current and capacitor dynamics to optimize ac voltage control for the MMC.

The proposed model enhances the accuracy of voltage control performance prediction compared to conventional models, enabling targeted controller tuning that improves voltage dynamic response and stability performance. Finally, detailed simulation and experiment results under various conditions verify the accuracy of the proposed model and the effectiveness of the control optimization strategy.</description></item><item><title>An Improved Electromagnetic-Structural Coupling Vibration Model of Wound Core Under SPWM Excitation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10973174</link><description>The modeling and analysis of transformer core electromagnetic vibration considering hysteresis and magnetostrictive effects are challenging multiphysical problems. For SPWM application scenarios, a new vibration-predicting method of the wound core based on electromagnetic-structural coupling model is presented. First, the magnetostriction neural network model based on time-domain characteristics (MNNM-TD) of core strips is established. Compared with the conventional Jiles&#8211;Atherton&#8211;Sablik (J-A-S) physical model, MNNM-TD can more accurately describe the features of the magnetostriction under SPWM excitation. Second, a variable-parameter J-A model based on the simplified Newton's method is presented to obtain the precise flux density distribution. Then, an improved electromagnetic-structural coupling vibration model is built, which is an anisotropic model that simultaneously considers core saturation, hysteresis, and magnetostriction characteristics. Finally, the proposed wound core vibration model is verified by experiments. Under SPWM excitation, the errors of the main components of the acceleration level spectrum are less than 1.65 dB. This article realizes the accurate prediction of the wound core vibration under SPWM excitation, which will contribute to the development of vibration suppression technology for the power electronics system.</description></item><item><title>ZVS Boundary Analysis and Optimization Strategy of Phase-Shift Values for Three-Level Dual-Active-Bridge Converters Using Harmonic Decomposition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10977021</link><description>The dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter, comprising a primary-side three-level neutral-point-clamped bridge and a secondary-side H-bridge, represents a promising topology for voltage conversion applications between medium-voltage dc and low-voltage dc.

The proposed model offers a more accurate and simpler alternative to the conventional minor-loop criterion and the generalized Nyquist stability criterion for studying the stability of a Droop-GFM converter, as it accounts for loading effects and uses only two transfer functions. Formulated in the $\alpha \beta$ frame, the model consists of only two balanced impedances, offering a clearer physical interpretation of the impedance asymmetry introduced by droop control, in contrast to dq-frame impedance matrix models. The model describes frequency coupling effects (the mirror frequency problem) across the entire frequency range, providing both a geometric and physical understanding of this phenomenon. It allows determination of the bandwidth of the frequency coupling region, and how this region changes based on the droop coefficients and the loading condition of the Droop-GFM converter. The theoretical findings are validated experimentally using a Droop-GFM converter in three distinct scenarios, including: weak power grid operation, a change in the droop coefficients, and a change in the power grid impedance.</description></item><item><title>Multifrequency Model of Dual Active Bridge Resonant Converters With Phase-Shift Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002737</link><description>The dual-active-bridge (DAB) resonant converters are a cluster of efficient bidirectional dc-dc converters. It is commonly a challenge to obtain the analytic expressions of the control-to-output transfer functions especially in multi-element resonant converters. In this article, the multifrequency modeling technique is adopted to derive the general small-signal model for DAB resonant converters with various resonant tanks. The analytic expression of phase-shift-angle-to-output-voltage transfer function as well as the general control block diagram of DAB resonant converter is obtained. It is interesting to see that the models are different depending on primary side phase shift or secondary side phase shift. To have a clear picture of the differences, order reductions of the models are conducted with the example of the DAB series resonant converter. Finally, the prototype of the DAB series resonant converter is built in the lab, and the phase-shift-angle-to-output-voltage transfer function is measured, which successfully verifies the validity of the proposed model.</description></item><item><title>Time Domain Analysis and Gain Curve Modeling of Fractional-Order Full-Bridge LLC Resonant Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003900</link><description>This article adopts fractional calculus and its Laplace transform to model and analyze the fractional-order full-bridge LLC resonant converter (FO-FBLLC), which aims to extend the topology to fractional-order domain and construct a FO dc model of FO-FBLLC.

The model represents the mosfet as an equivalent conductance and considers the effects of the switching junction capacitance as well as the gate drive circuit, on the transient behavior of the switching device.

However, commercial curve tracer instruments can only measure a limited range of conduction characteristics at low drain-source voltage biases. In addition, the long dynamic settling times intrinsic to commercial curve tracers introduce self-heating (SH) artifacts that compromise the accuracy of the resulting characterization data. These limitations prevent SiC mofsetmodels from accurately predicting dynamic switching events and short-circuit failures. Alternative characterization methods are difficult to implement, do not provide a holistic data set, and are susceptible to measurement and VTH hysteresis errors. This article proposes an advanced experimental conduction characterization approach that can accurately characterize SiC mofsets at high-voltage and high-current without SH or VTH hysteresis errors. The method provides lower-error measurements than commercial curve tracers at the same operating conditions while also expanding the characterization range to high voltages. The measured results encompass the entire I&#8211;V space and can be used to model SiC mofsets without combining data from multiple instruments. The proposed method is used to characterize and model a SiC half-bridge power module, which is shown to be more accurate than a model generated with commercial curve tracer data.</description></item><item><title>A Passive Lossless and Nonshoot-Through Soft-Switching High Power Density Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10976580</link><description>Soft switching technique is the main method to increase the inverter switching frequency and thus improve the power density, which is one of the current research hotspots. Inverter soft switching needs to operate in four quadrants, wide range, time-varying load current conditions, the realization of the more complex. At this stage, soft-switching inverters are mainly based on bridge circuits, and the intertwined soft-switching and shoot-through deadtime problems in bridge circuits are one of the difficulties in limiting the improvement of inverter switching frequency and power density. To solve this problem, a passive lossless and nonshoot-through soft-switching inverter is designed in this article, which fundamentally eliminates the constraints of shoot-through to soft-switching of the inverter. The four-quadrant operating mode is given, in which the high-frequency chopper bridge operates at unidirectional voltage and current conditions, thus achieving full-load range soft switching using passive coupled inductors. Increased switching frequency and the size of the filtering components is significantly reduced. This article analyses the specific operating modes, soft switching conditions, losses, parameters, and control methods. A 1-kW prototype is established, and the results of the experiment verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis. The prototype achieves the power density of 5.8 kW/L and the peak efficiency of 97.1% at 400&#8201;kHz.</description></item><item><title>Core Loss Calculation Method Considering Leakage Flux Induced Power Loss for Nanocrystalline Core High-Frequency Transformer Under Load Condition</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981945</link><description>Besides the main flux-induced core loss, high flux density, and normal leakage flux in surface ribbons of nanocrystalline core can produce excess leakage flux core loss (LFCL) and leakage flux eddy current loss (LFECL), which are usually overlooked in core loss calculation. In this paper, total core loss of nanocrystalline core HFT under load condition is proposed to be calculated by summation of main flux induced core loss, LFCL and LFECL. The LFCL is proposed to be calculated by improved generalized Steinmetz equation based on practical flux density distribution and the LFECL is proposed to be calculated by Fourier superposition method based on LFECL resistances. Further, the impacts of surface ribbons saturation on LFCL and LFECL are analyzed. A three-dimensional finite element simulation method is proposed to calculate flux density and eddy current density distributions. A LFCL attenuation factor and a LFECL multiplication factor are proposed to correct LFCL and LFECL considering saturation. A HFT prototype is made and calorimetric method is applied to measure core loss. Without considering LFCL and LFECL, core loss calculation errors can exceed 60%. With the proposed method, leakage flux power loss calculation errors are within 15% and total core loss calculation errors are within 10%. The LFCL and LFECL are negligible in nanocrystalline core loss. The proposed method can guide nanocrystalline core HFT design.</description></item><item><title>Partial Discharge Behavior of High-Frequency Transformer Insulation Under High-Voltage PWM Stress</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10989053</link><description>As the voltage levels of solid-state transformers (SSTs) increase using medium-voltage switches, high-frequency transformers (HFTs) used inside SSTs are subjected to increased electrical stress. This stress, characterized by high voltage, high-frequency pulsewidth modulation (PWM) voltage, can cause insulation partial discharge (PD) and potentially lead to failure of the HFT insulation system. While PD behavior under power-frequency sinusoidal voltage has been extensively studied, the behavior of HFT insulation under PWM square pulse conditions is less well understood. To address this gap, a high voltage high-frequency PWM voltage PD test platform is developed and high-frequency current transformer (HFCT) and ultra-high-frequency (UHF) antenna are used for PD signal detection. PD tests are performed under a variety of PWM conditions including PWM frequency, rise time, voltage amplitude, and different insulation layers to thoroughly investigate the HFT insulation behavior. The PD characteristics of repetitive PD inception voltage and phase-resolved PD patterns at different PWM conditions are recorded and analyzed under PWM conditions. In addition, this article explores the underlying PD mechanisms of the HFT insulation under high-frequency PWM stress, providing insights to explain the observed test results. The findings from this research provide essential references and lay a solid foundation for future advances in optimal design, health monitoring, reliability analysis, and lifetime prediction for HFTs in power electronics applications.</description></item><item><title>Integrated Inductor-Transformers for High-Frequency Converters: An Overview</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002523</link><description>Integrated inductor-transformers, eliminating the need for external series inductors, provide disruptive improvements toward compact, efficient, and cost-effective converters in industries such as automotive and data center power supplies.

While previous studies have used thermal cycling tests ranging from &#8722;40 to 250 &#176;C, in situ observations of degradation in AMB-AlN have not been reported. In this work, internal cracking and 3-D deformation of AMB-AlN substrates were monitored by acoustic emission (AE) and digital image correlation (DIC) methods, respectively, throughout successive thermal cycles. The AMB-AlN substrates were significantly delaminated after eight thermal cycles. In the first five cycles, negligible deformation and delamination were observed by 3-D DIC and scanning acoustic microscopy. The cracks detected by AE produced low-amplitude signals only around &#8722;40 &#176;C. From the sixth to eighth cycles, the AE signal increased rapidly with the clear deformation of the substrate and depended on the temperature. A good correlation was found between the accumulated number of cracks detected by AE and the height of the Cu delamination from the substrate determined by DIC. In light of these findings, the delamination of the AMB-AlN substrate was attributed to the propagation of cracks in the substrate and their interconnected growth.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Enhanced Fault-Tolerant Full-Bridge Modular Multilevel Converters Using Reconfiguration During Open-Circuit Failures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982046</link><description>Modular multilevel converters (MMCs) are widely used in various applications due to their scalability, efficiency, and fault-tolerant capabilities. This article proposes a fault-tolerant methodology tailored for full-bridge (FB) submodules (SMs) in MMCs to enhance system reliability under open-circuit faults (OCFs) in insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs).

Accurate fault detection and localization are achieved through established methods, such as state observers and voltage comparisons. It is shown using MCS that the proposed method can improve the 17 kV 10 MVA converter reliability by almost 25% over solely redundancy-based solution for given lifetime requirements. Finally, using a lab-scale FB MMC prototype, it is experimentally shown that the proposed reconfiguration technique can successfully localize the fault and revert to normal operating requirements by shifting from FB to HB SM configuration in approximately 20 ms of fault initiation.</description></item><item><title>An Overview of Digital Twin Technology for Power Electronics: State-of-the-Art and Future Trends</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11005593</link><description>Power electronic systems (PESs) are pivotal in power generation, transmission, and diverse industrial applications.

However, under unbalanced grid conditions, the grid current becomes distorted, and the dc voltage exhibits a secondary ripple. To solve these problems, this article proposes a high gain proportional resonant (HGPR) ripple suppression method, the ripple suppression speed of the HGPR is faster than that of proportional resonant controllers, compared to quasi proportional resonant controllers, the HGPR controller offers higher gain and reduced steady-state error while maintaining a similar bandwidth and thus not affecting the stability of the system while maintaining the same parameter configuration. Compared with the existing dc voltage ripple suppression methods, the method proposed in this article has stronger ripple suppression capability, lower computational complexity, and excellent dynamic performance. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed HGPR method can achieve low ripple dc voltage and low total harmonic distortion of current under grid voltage unbalance.</description></item><item><title>Modeling and Decoupled Control of the Three-Level Interleaved DC&#8211;DC Converter With Coupled Inductors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10971249</link><description>For emerging high power dc&#8211;dc applications, such as those in power-to-x and energy storage systems, the three-level interleaved converter with coupled inductors offers several advantages, such as increased voltage and current ratings and a strong reduction of the output current ripple.

While larger dc-link electrolytic capacitors can help mitigate this issue by reducing neutral-point voltage oscillations, they also lead to a substantial increase in the volume of converters. This article presents consolidated carrier-based DPWM strategies capable of mitigating input current distortion by rectifying the vector synthesis error induced by oscillated NP voltages. Therefore, even with smaller dc-link capacitances, the improved input current performance can still be preserved. Moreover, the proposed methods employ only fundamental algebraic functions, helping conserve the limited hardware resources of the digital processor. Ultimately, an experimental prototype has been constructed to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed strategies.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time Optimal Control of Dual-Bridge Series Resonant DC&#8211;AC Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980455</link><description>Control plays a critical role in achieving efficient operation of dual-bridge series resonant dc&#8211;ac converters (DBSRC). However, realizing real-time, optimal, and robust control of DBSRC to maximize its efficiency is generally difficult, due to the complex interplay of control variables, efficiency, power demand, and voltage conversion ratio requirements. Here, we propose an optimal control strategy for DBSRC, suitable for real-time closed-loop controller implementation. The key to the strategy is the development of a closed-form analytical solution of the optimal control variables for maximum system efficiency and output power regulation. Detailed derivation of the optimal control solution is provided. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated on a 200-W DBSRC prototype.

The generated power is delivered to the grid by way of two paths: one via a passive rectifier and line-frequency inverter, and the other through an active rectifier and an inverter operating at switching frequencies higher than their respective fundamental frequencies, with the maximum power processed only 10% of the rated power. The remaining power is processed using the line-frequency path, employing reliable, efficient, and inexpensive diodes and switches. An analytical design framework shows that the high-frequency switch volt-ampere rating can be reduced by 67.9%.

Most of the TLIs in the literature either work on a buck or boost mode of operation. This article presents a new reduced-component five-level transformerless inverter (RC5LTLI) with a common ground configuration (CGC) for dual modes (buck and boost) of operation. Dual-mode operation enables the generation of output voltage across a wide range of input voltages while using a relatively small number of power components to achieve a five-level output. The CGC helps maintain a nearly constant common mode voltage and minimizes leakage current (LC). The level-shifted pulsewidth modulation generates the required gate pulses of RC5LTLI. A proportional resonant controller is used to perform the closed-loop operation of the inverter. The advantage of RC5LTLI can be found by conducting a comparative study with the similar existing art of literature. Further, losses and stress across the power components are analyzed using the PLECS simulation. The performance of RC5LTLI is verified experimentally for $1-\phi$ system for dual mode operation under unity power factor, lagging power factor, and the changes in input voltage. The practical feasibility of the RC5LTLI harmonic profile of the experimental prototype at 1 kW is studied on a power quality analyzer and matched to the European Energy Standard DIN VDE 126-1-1 that obeys the current and voltage limits and LC less than 300 mA. Last, the tested efficiency of the inverter system is 97.5% for the 1 kW load.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability Analysis of Multiparallel Grid-Forming Converters Considering Active and Reactive Power Control Coupling and Current Limiting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10982104</link><description>During fault recovery stage, multiparallel grid-forming (MP-GFM) converters may retrigger the current limiter, leading to transient synchronization instability. While most existing studies focus on the transient synchronization stability (TSS) of single converters, and the well-established TSS studies designed for synchronous generators are not directly applicable to MP-GFM converters due to two key differences: active and reactive power control loop (ARPCL) coupling and current limiting. This article aims to address the TSS issue of MP-GFM converters during fault recovery stage, considering these two factors. First, a mathematical model of a system with MP-GFM converters is developed, considering ARPCL coupling and current limiting. Then, for the first time, the current limiting constrained largest estimated domain of attraction (CL-LEDA) is defined and constructed. Specifically, unlike traditional energy function (EF) that only considers active power control dynamics, an analytical EF that incorporates ARPCL coupling is proposed in this article. Furthermore, considering current limiting constraint, a new idea to calculate the critical energy value is proposed based on LaSalle's invariance principle. Then, the CL-LEDA can be constructed by the obtained EF and critical energy value. Provided that the operating state is located within this CL-LEDA at fault clearance moment, all MP-GFM converters will achieve transient stability, without triggering current limiting during faults recovery stage. Finally, experimental results based on RT-LAB hardware-in-the-loop and complete hardware-based experimental verify the analysis.</description></item><item><title>Modeling Method for DFIG-Based Wind Farm in High-Efficiency Real-Time Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) Simulations</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988635</link><description>With the increasing integration of renewable energy into power systems, electromagnetic transient simulation has become indispensable for accurate system analysis. However, the complexity of wind turbine modeling, characterized by a large number of electrical nodes, poses significant challenges and necessitates substantial real-time simulation hardware. Existing methods for reducing circuit complexity improve simulation efficiency, but are each associated with inherent limitations. Aggregation methods sacrifice considerable internal station information, while existing decoupling techniques are constrained by specific requirements. This article proposes a real-time simulation model for a doubly fed induction generator-based wind farm (WF) using latency decoupling and a multilevel nested fast and simultaneous solution approach, effectively reducing node count while preserving internal details. A WF test model is implemented in real-time digital simulator (RTDS) for validation.

The MMDC is composed of numerous insulated gate bipolar transistor-based switches, which may impose an open-circuit fault (OCF). When an OCF occurs in the switch of the MMDC, the internal voltage and current may severely distort, potentially affecting the safe operation of the system. To address this issue, this article proposes a quasi-two-level modulation based OCF diagnosis and fault-tolerant operation method for an MMDC, which utilizes the signal synthesis of arm current and arm voltage modulation. First, the relationship between fault arm current and modulation wave is revealed. Based on this, a fault diagnosis algorithm is proposed to accurately identify the faulty arm and the fault type, without requiring additional sensors or complex calculations. The MMDC is then controlled in the proposed fault-tolerant mode by actively modifying the modulation wave until the specific faulty submodule is located and bypassed. This reduces voltage and current distortion. Subsequently, the modulation wave automatically returns to normal, allowing the system to quickly recover. Verification results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately and rapidly diagnoses the OCF and achieve fault-tolerant operation.</description></item><item><title>Model Predictive Power Control for High-Frequency Link Matrix Converter With Phase Compensation Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994363</link><description>High-frequency link matrix converter (HFLMC) is suitable for the battery testing instrument due to the characteristics of high efficiency and high reliability.

Active power control (APC) and phase-locked loop (PLL) are essential considerations while reactive power control (RPC) is often deemed negligible, particularly in stiff grid. However, such assumptions may be inappropriate. Therefore, this article aims to comprehensively examine the effects of APC and RPC on the inertia for doubly fed induction generator-based WTs. Firstly, phase motion models are developed by incorporating various combinations of control loops, including APC, RPC, and different PLL configurations. Subsequently, the impacts of the APC and RPC on the inertia are examined in detail. The analysis reveals that the APC diminishes inertia, whereas the RPC significantly enhances the inertia. Additionally, special attention should be given to phase characteristics of the inertia transfer function, as they can substantially influence inertial performance. Furthermore, an improved frequency support method is proposed, which achieves superior frequency response without necessitating the PLL bandwidth to be adjusted to extremely low values, such as 1 Hz or lower. Finally, the analysis and the proposed method are validated through experiments.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-High-Voltage Gain DC&#8211;DC Converter Based on Three-Winding Coupled Inductor With Ripple Free Input Current and Soft Switching for Renewable Energy Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994321</link><description>High-gain dc&#8211;dc converters are an important link for connecting low-voltage renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaics, to the high-voltage dc bus. This article presents a nonisolated ultra-high-voltage gain converter based on a three-winding coupled inductor for distributed renewable energy applications. The input inductor and clamping capacitor greatly reduce the input current ripple, so that tiny filter capacitors are required at the input port. Moreover, zero-voltage-switching and zero-current-switching of switches and diodes, respectively, are implemented, which effectively improves the efficiency of the proposed converter. In addition, the low-voltage stress of the semiconductor devices and the small number of components are also significant advantages of the proposed converter compared to existing topologies. The aforementioned features, as well as the common grounding of input and output, make the proposed topology a desirable solution for transformer less renewable energy systems. The operating principles, steady-state performance, design considerations, control method and dynamic modeling, and performance comparison of the proposed dc&#8211;dc converter have been demonstrated in this article. Finally, experimental results for a 500 W laboratory prototype with an input voltage of 30&#8211;40 V and a regulated output voltage of 400 V are shown to confirm the operation of the proposed converters.</description></item><item><title>Voltage Feedforward Damping Control Based on Duffing&#8211;Hopf Oscillator for Parallel Grid-Forming Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10995238</link><description>Oscillator-based grid-forming (GFM) control, such as dispatchable virtual oscillator and Andronov&#8211;Hopf oscillator control, offers a rigorous analytical framework with enhanced synchronization, lower harmonic, and faster dynamic response but lacks effective inertia support. Insufficient inertia will impair the stability and reliability of the power system, especially in the system with parallel inverters. To fundamentally solve the issue of insufficient inertia in traditional oscillator-based GFM control, a Duffing&#8211;Hopf oscillator control is proposed. The second-order Duffing&#8211;Hopf oscillator control ensures inertia and damping properties within the active power control loop. Furthermore, a q-axis component of the point of common coupling (PCC) voltage feedforward damping control is proposed to suppress active power oscillation during load fluctuations in the parallel system. The feedforward component provides extra damping power by indirectly incorporating the grid frequency into the active power control loop without relying on a phase-locked loop. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional oscillator-based GFM control, the Duffing&#8211;Hopf oscillator control provides enough inertia and damping ratio to alleviate the rate of change of frequency, and the q-axis component of PCC voltage feedforward control can effectively suppress the power oscillations caused by inconsistent control parameters.</description></item><item><title>Wide Voltage Range Efficiency Enhancement Scheme for Input-Parallel-Output-Series DAB Converters in 800 V DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10999069</link><description>Input-parallel-output-series dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter presents an appealing approach in energy storage integrated high-voltage dc microgrids. The wide voltage range of the energy storage battery introduces significant challenges to the optimal design of the DAB converter. To cope with this issue, this article proposes a hybrid modulation scheme to enhance the wide voltage range efficiency. It combines asymmetrical pulsewidth modulation (APWM), phase-shift modulation, and coupled inductor modulation, aimed at optimizing circulating currents and extending the zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) range across wide voltage and load ranges. APWM ensures that the primary and secondary voltages are aligned through the intermediary dc blocking capacitor. Meanwhile, the coupled inductor modulation achieves an adaptive equivalent series inductance. The operational modes of this modulation scheme are outlined, with a thorough analysis of the relationship between root-mean-square (rms) current, phase shift ratio, voltage gain, and output power. Based on these insights, a control strategy is developed to extend the ZVS range with reduced rms currents. To validate the concept, a 2-kW, 100-kHz prototype is designed and tested. The prototype interfaces a 200&#8211;400 V battery port to an 800 V dc bus. Recorded efficiencies peak at 98.3% in forward mode and 98.2% in backward mode, with consistently high performance maintained across wide voltage and load ranges.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Constraints Model Active Mismatch Predictive Control for Power Converters of Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11006519</link><description>Model predictive control (MPC) is widely employed for power converters in energy storage systems.

However, standard model predictive control suffers from a high dependency on model parameters. To solve this issue, a novel finite set subspace predictor-based predictive voltage control strategy is proposed in this article, aiming to improve the robustness of the controlled system while maintaining the attractive features of standard FCS-MPC. Specifically, by replacing the original physical model with a subspace predictor at each operating point, the optimal control input can be directly obtained according to the reference output trajectory, and the control action can be executed without knowing the system structure and load parameters. This method uses only historical input&#8211;output data in the prediction process, thereby avoiding performance degradation caused by variations in load parameters. Finally, experiments on a three-level neutral-point clamped inverter validate the proposed design.</description></item><item><title>Long-Horizon MPC Reference Generator for Circulating Currents in Modular Multilevel Converter-Based Variable-Speed Drives</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869501</link><description>The article introduces a circulating current reference generator based on a constrained model predictive control (MPC) in modular multilevel converters (M2C) for drive applications.

The optimal control problem is decomposed into smaller subproblems, which allows the utilization of an iterative algorithm based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to efficiently solve the optimization problem. As a result, the ADMM-based reference generator enables a considerably extended prediction horizon, which enhances M2C performance, particularly in balancing and mitigating low-frequency oscillations in capacitor voltages during challenging operating conditions like low-speed and high-torque scenarios. The proposed control is validated by experimental results using an M2C with four cells per cluster driving a 3 kW induction machine.</description></item><item><title>Terrace-Shaped Core Design Method for Inductive Power Transfer System Considering Uniform Magnetic Flux Distribution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10852559</link><description>Inductive power transfer (IPT) has attracted a lot of attention, and it has a tendency toward high-power applications. However, the problem of nonuniform magnetic flux distribution exists and is unsolved in IPT systems, which will cause unbalanced core loss and local heat, lowering the system&#8217;s stability. Therefore, a novel terrace-shaped core made of nanocrystalline flake ribbon (NFR) is proposed and investigated to balance the magnetic flux in the core for curved double-D couplers. Unlike merely increasing the core thickness in the center area, the terrace-shaped NFR (T-NFR) can realize uniform magnetic flux distribution and balanced temperature along the core.

However, for the PSFB WPT system, switching loss is a key factor affecting the system efficiency. Single-side PSFB can regulate the power, but hard switching results in low efficiency and EMI problems. Dual-side PSFB can realize ZVS throughout a wide power range, but at the cost of high conduction loss and turn-off loss at light load. In this article, a WPT converter combining tandem half bridge (THB) and active rectifier (AR) is proposed to reduce the switching loss of the system at light and medium loads.

Model-based control is widely used in converters due to its ease, but it poses challenges when dealing with inaccurate models, critical loads, and multidisturbances.

Their flexibility comes from the possibility to store hydrogen, decoupling electric consumption from hydrogen demand. Therefore, they can help in the integration of more renewable energies by the provision of grid services, such as frequency regulation. Alkaline electrolyzers (AELs) are the most mature and cost effective technology for large-scale hydrogen applications. However, their slow dynamics do not allow a fast response. Therefore, their combination with energy storage systems (ESSs) into hybrid hydrogen systems (HHSs) enhances their flexibility and fast response for frequency regulation. Supercapacitors (SCs) are suitable ESS technology in this application due to the high power and low energy required. A decentralized dynamic power sharing control is proposed for an AEL/SC HHS to provide frequency regulation with scalability. The control strategy respects the slow dynamics of the AEL, while the use of the SC is optimized by the automatic recovery of the dc bus voltage and SC state of charge (SoC). The decentralized approach of the control strategy enables easy expansion of the system, essential for large-scale hydrogen systems. The effectiveness of the method in large-scale power systems, as well as its scalability is shown in simulation results. The control strategy is validated with experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Dynamic Analysis of Photovoltaic to Virtual Bus Parallel Differential Power Processing Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856681</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) to virtual bus parallel differential power processing (PDPP) architecture can mitigate mismatch losses among PV strings.

However, while operating as a voltage source that is synchronized via active power regulation, the GFM converter exhibits insufficient damping, particularly when synthetic inertia is incorporated for frequency support. To address this concern, this article has developed active-damping control schemes using fractional-order regulators. Differing from the existing control approaches, which may significantly alter the inertial response quantified using an inertia constant, the proposed controls are developed to introduce adequate damping for both power set-point tracking and external disturbances, while maintaining the original explicit relationship between the GFM converter's inertial response and the inertia constant. In this context, a preferable inertial response, precisely defined by the inertia constant as specified by certain grid codes, along with adequate damping, is achieved simultaneously. The effectiveness of the proposed controls has been validated though both theoretical analyses and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Design-Oriented Small-Signal Stability Assessment of Grid-Following Inverter-Based Resources Based on Virtual Dynamic Short-Circuit Ratio</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856703</link><description>Small-signal instability may occur when parallel grid-following inverter-based resources (IBRs) are connected to a grid with low strength, i.e., a weak grid. In such a weak grid, changes in output power and the number of IBRs can significantly impact the small-signal stability margin. However, the short-circuit ratios (SCRs) currently used for small-signal stability assessment of the IBR plant are static indices, and the difference in the IBR plant impedance with different total output power is not considered, resulting in inaccurate stability assessment results. Moreover, the stability margin expressed by the existing SCRs under different operating conditions is not unified. Therefore, the virtual dynamic short-circuit ratio (VDSCR) is proposed in this article, which converts the stability margin of the IBR plant under different working conditions to the rated single IBR unit, so that the proposed VDSCR is accurate and unified. Based on the VDSCR, the IBRs control is designed under the fluctuation of total output power and grid impedance, which can keep the small-signal stability margin at the set value. While ensuring the small-signal stability of the IBR plant, the control performance of the IBRs is further optimized through the control design based on VDSCR. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Optimal FNN-Based Energy Management System With High Real-Time Performance and Good Interpretability for Battery in Grid-Connected Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858356</link><description>In this article, a novel energy management system (EMS) is presented for a grid-connected microgrid using the fuzzy neural network (FNN), aiming to minimize the mismatch between renewable power generation and load power demand in the microgrid by controlling the battery charge/discharge power in real time, so as to effectively promote the local consumption of renewable energy.

To overcome these issues, this article proposes a partial-power converter for BESS. It stacks voltage-tuning bridge and reversal-blocking chopper on battery pack with their dc-links crossly connected through a three-port dc&#8211;dc circuit. The dc&#8211;dc circuit provides isolated low-impedance channels for automatically clamping dc-link voltages. This ensures the linear voltage regulation in normal state and immediate short-circuit-current blocking under fault condition. As compared to the prior arts, the proposal achieves: 1) linear voltage regulations in wide range through step-up and step-down operations guided by pulse width modulation without any dead zones; 2) immediate dc fault blocking by deenergizing short circuit loop rather than by interrupting the current, thereby avoiding spike and stickiness issues; and 3) around 0.5% enhancement in power efficiency due to the fully resonant dc&#8211;dc unit with low switching losses, and the substitution of the two anti-series switch in dc breaker by the one in reversal-blocking unit. The entire system achieves the maximal power efficiency of 98.93%. The feasibility of the proposal is fully confirmed by the experiments rated at 350-V 3.5-kW.</description></item><item><title>A Multifunctional Arc Suppression Device Based on Hybrid Grid-Connected Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856704</link><description>Since the voltage amplitude of the arc suppression device is different during the normal operation and single line-to-ground fault, the problems of high cost and low module utilization rate are serious. An integrated grid-connected converter (IGCC) with reactive power compensation and fault regulation ability is proposed. First, the topology and operation mechanism of IGCC are introduced in this article. A common unit combining neutral point clamped (NPC) and cascaded H-bridge is formed by improving the traditional arc suppression device. By adding a fourth leg in the NPC module and connecting with the arc suppression inductance, the integration of the two structures is realized. The access of NPC unit not only reduces the number of modules of traditional arc suppression device, but also provides an integrated port for arc suppression device and reactive power compensation device. Second, the parameters of active and passive part of IGCC are optimally designed to ensure the stable operation of IGCC. In addition, compared with existing schemes, the superiority of IGCC in cost and volume is proved. Finally, the correctness, feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed topology and functions are verified by the simulation and experiment results.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Modeling of Battery-Based Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869498</link><description>This article presents a data-driven modeling methodology applied to a battery-based power system comprising a power converter and an electric machine.

In particular, the proposed approach considers the battery as the supplying element of a broader system comprising power electronics converters and direct-current motors, paying special attention to the battery open-circuit voltage curve estimation. This approach successfully yields a state-space representation that optimally describes the more essential variables, such as motor speed and output voltages of the converter and battery. Consequently, the proposed approach allows the generation of higher-order models representing transient and rapid dynamics and facilitates the identification of parameters that define reduced-order models describing slower dynamics. This streamlines the implementation of adaptive control strategies, providing an effective tool for their development and execution.</description></item><item><title>Attention-Based UAV Trajectory Optimization for Wireless Power Transfer-Assisted IoT Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879146</link><description>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in wireless power transfer (WPT)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) systems face the following challenges: limited resources and suboptimal trajectory planning. Reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning schemes face issues of low search efficiency and learning instability when optimizing large-scale systems. To address these issues, we present an attention-based UAV trajectory optimization (AUTO) framework based on the graph transformer, which consists of an attention trajectory optimization model (ATOM) and a trajectory lEarNing method based on actor&#8211;critic (TENMA). In ATOM, a graph encoder is used to calculate the self-attention characteristics of all IoTDs, and a trajectory decoder is developed to optimize the number and trajectories of UAVs. TENMA then trains the ATOM using an improved actor&#8211;critic method, in which the real reward of the system is applied as the baseline to reduce variances in the critic network. This method is suitable for high-quality and large-scale multi-UAV trajectory planning. Finally, we develop numerous experiments, including a hardware experiment in the field case, to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the AUTO framework.</description></item><item><title>Assessment of the DSC Technique for Positive-Sequence Extraction in Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858480</link><description>In the context of electrical power systems, where nonlinear loads, power converters, and exogenous disturbances can significantly distort electrical signals, there remains a critical need to accurately extract signal parameters useful for various essential tasks, including monitoring, synchronization, and protection. Traditionally, a positive-sequence filter, often based on the well-established Park filter, has been used to mitigate these disturbances. However, the delayed signal cancellation technique (DSC) has gained prominence as a viable alternative, offering similar advantages to the Park filter, but without the need for phase feedback. This growing interest in DSC has led to numerous studies that aim to refine its original concept. However, these efforts have not comprehensively evaluated the DSC alongside the Park filter to discern and quantify its benefits and drawbacks. Inspired by the fact that the DSC exhibits spectral replica, characterized by high-gain repeating side lobes in its frequency response, this article aims to conduct a thorough comparative analysis between the DSC technique and the conventional Park filter. The primary objective is to quantitatively evaluate both approaches in positive-sequence extraction tasks, thereby shedding light on their practical advantages in scenarios marked by signal distortion and perturbations.</description></item><item><title>A Fault-Tolerant Control for Hybrid Active Neutral-Point-Clamped Converters With Shared Redundant Unit Under Multiswitch Open-Circuit Fault</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10870874</link><description>Hybrid active neutral-point-clamped (HANPC) converters comprising silicon and silicon carbide devices are promising topologies in middle-low power conversion systems. The reliable operation of such converters is highly desirable, which depends on effective fault-tolerant schemes. However, existing schemes do not provide HANPC converters with the ability to tolerate the failures of multiple outer-switches with satisfactory fault-tolerant performance in terms of neutral-point voltage balancing and rated output voltage. To address this issue, the shared redundant unit is configured into HANPC converters. The matched fault-tolerant control strategy is proposed with rearranged switching sequences by utilizing the available space vector. In this context, the feasible region of the designed vector sequence (FRDVS) for fault-tolerant operation of HANPC converters is defined. Subsequently, the boundaries of FRDVS are quantitatively analyzed under different power factors. The improved fault-tolerant scheme allows the continuous operation of HANPC converters at rated capacity during the fault period, even up to open-circuit faults at all outer-switches. Experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed fault-tolerant scheme.</description></item><item><title>Multiobjective Optimization Control for Nonideal Single-Inductor Dual-Output Buck Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10858475</link><description>Single-inductor dual-output (SIDO) buck converter has been widely applied in fields of portable electronic products and smart homes due to their advantages of small size and multiple outputs. However, cross regulation seriously deteriorates the stability of the converter. In addition, parasitic parameters of circuit components reduce the conversion efficiency of the converter and have a significant impact on cross regulation. To suppress the cross regulation and improve the conversion efficiency of the nonideal SIDO buck converter, a multiobjective optimization control strategy is proposed. Considering the parasitic parameters of circuit components, a large signal model of the converter is established, and a predictive equation is constructed based on the model predictive control theory. Furthermore, an objective function for optimizing output error is established based on weighting the output voltage error and inductor current error. Then, a method is proposed to achieve real-time correction of the state variable reference values. The power loss of the system is analyzed and weighted onto the objective function to improve the conversion efficiency. Compared with the common mode voltage-differential mode voltage control method, simulation and experimental results show that the proposed strategy provides smaller cross regulation and better dynamic performance. The conversion efficiency is improved by 6.6%.</description></item><item><title>A Quasi-Noncascaded DC-Link Voltage Predictive Control of a PWM Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10875037</link><description>The main function of pulse-width modulation (PWM) converters in many applications is to control the dc-link voltage with good dynamic performance and strong disturbance rejection capability. Finite-control-set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) is known for its merits in both the above aspects, especially the noncascaded FCS-MPC control structure. However, as to be discussed in this article, the noncascaded FCS-MPC cannot be used to directly control the dc-link voltage of PWM converters, due to the problem of multiequilibrium points caused by the essential nonlinear characteristic of PWM converters. Hence, a quasi-noncascaded dc-link voltage predictive control structure is proposed for the first time, which keeps the outstanding dynamic performance and strong disturbance rejection capability of noncascaded FCS-MPC while avoids overcurrent caused by the unexpected equilibrium points. In addition, the proposed method can inherently handle the parameter mismatch issue, which is an important merit for MPC. Experimental results validate the theoretical analysis and performance of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>A Robust Open Circuit Fault Detection and Localization Scheme for HERIC PV Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10855000</link><description>Transformerless inverters are widely used to integrate the photovoltaic (PV) source into the distributed generation system. Within the converter, an open-circuit (OC) switch fault may lead to the partial or total failure of the converter. To address this issue, a new technique for detecting and localizing OC switch faults based on pole-to-pole voltage (voltage measured across the inverter output terminals) is proposed. The proposed variables for fault detection and localization (FDL) are continuously generated with every sampled pole-to-pole voltage and are compared with threshold values which are immune to parameter variation. As a result, OC is detected and located within a switching cycle for the ac side bypass switches. For localizing the OC fault in the H-bridge, the converter is reconfigured once the fault in the H-bridge switch is detected using pole-to-pole voltage. The input voltage required for the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is estimated from the voltage measured with the new sensor arrangement for pole-to-pole voltage measurement. This makes the number of sensors the same as in a conventional converter. The viability and effectiveness of this approach are demonstrated through simulation studies on the highly efficient and reliable inverter concept (HERIC) inverter, a popular transformerless inverter topology. Additionally, a laboratory prototype is developed to validate the practical applicability of the method.</description></item><item><title>Extended Kalman Filtering for Floating Capacitor Voltage Estimation on Triple Star Bridge Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10871191</link><description>Modular multilevel cascade converters (MMCCs) have emerged as one of the most attractive topologies for medium and high-voltage applications due to their modularity, scalability, redundancy, and high power quality. Voltage balancing in power submodule (SM) capacitors plays a critical role in the internal energy balancing of the MMCC, making monitoring SM capacitor voltages a crucial task. However, achieving higher operating voltages requires a substantial increase in the number of voltage sensors and communication lines. This escalation in hardware complexity renders the system more reliant on sensors, reducing its reliability. Several techniques for estimating capacitor voltages have been presented to address this control and design burden. This work proposes an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based observer for capacitor voltage estimation of all SMs in a triple-star bridge converter (TSBC). The proposed approach operates effectively under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions during transients and steady-state operation, enabling a decoupled controller using just one voltage and one current sensor per cluster. Experiments conducted in a TSBC composed of 27 SMs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach during transients and steady-state operation.</description></item><item><title>Dual Storage Power Management for Energy Autonomous Microsystems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854998</link><description>A major challenge towards enabling energy autonomous microsystems is cold-starting, especially in real use case environments which are often uncertain and involve long inactivity periods. In this article, a dual supercapacitor storage power management architecture is proposed, with the primary storage capacitor providing fast start-up and the secondary providing a large energy buffer. The circuit introduces a combination of a MOSFET switch and a buck converter that can handle efficient charge transport and eliminate leakage between the two storage capacitors, leading to faster cold starting. A start-up time reduction of more than two orders of magnitude over conventional solutions is experimentally demonstrated, for a 1.5 mF/470 mF supercapacitor combination, without a compromise in overall efficiency. The various functional modes of the system are experimentally analyzed, using an inductive power line energy harvester with currents that correspond to an industrially defined aircraft sensor use case. For example, 11 mW and 32 mW regulated output was measured from a 10 A and 15 A rms, 500 Hz power line, respectively. The architecture is configurable and can be dynamically parametrized and controlled to optimize power routing according to functional priorities by the microcontroller of the powered system.</description></item><item><title>A Noninvasive Resonant Galvanometer With Multiple Measurement Ranges</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869509</link><description>Noninvasive, real-time monitoring of large-span currents in power grid and electric vehicles remains a challenge. A resonant galvanometer (RGM) achieving multiple measurement ranges with a single sensing unit is proposed in this article. An electromagnetic torque introduced theory for ac measurement is established to analyze the deviated output voltages, which have not been well physically interpreted and theoretically characterized so far. The deviated output voltages are defined as two asymmetric subpeaks for the first time. According to the Euler&#8211;Bernoulli beam theory, two asymmetric subpeaks have the potential to achieve multirange measurement with the main peak, which is at the magnetic field gradient extremum and directly opposite to the cable. A multirange sensing mechanism is proposed with three peaks, comprised of two newly defined asymmetric subpeaks and one main peak. Measurement ranges of the two subpeaks are two and five times than that of the main peak, respectively. Geometrical design of the sensing unit is analyzed to further adjust the multiranges via three peak values. A prototype with a single sensing unit is designed and fabricated to achieve multiple measurement ranges, and its practical applications in power grid and electric vehicles are also considered.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Method for Identifying the Reverse Recovery State of Thyristors Based on Gate Voltage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10875032</link><description>As a critical power electronic device in dc transmission systems, thyristors are highly favored for their low conduction loss, excellent surge capability, economic efficiency, and reliable current-carrying performance. However, in key applications such as commutation converters, active inverters, and circuit breakers, accurately determining the off-state of thyristors remains a significant challenge for the reliable operation of these systems. The traditional method relies on detecting the reverse recovery current flowing through the thyristor to determine its off-state. This method is often plagued by detection difficulties, high costs, and insufficient accuracy, and no new methods for detecting the off-state of thyristors have been proposed for decades. To address the difficulty in recognizing the off-state of thyristors, this article proposes a novel method for identifying the reverse recovery state of thyristors based on the gate voltage of the thyristor. This method eliminates the need to measure the high current on the primary side, requiring only the measurement of a small voltage on the secondary side to accurately determine the thyristor's reverse recovery state. Experimental validation confirms the feasibility of this approach. The proposed method offers advantages such as low cost and ease of integration, providing an effective solution for identifying the reverse recovery state of thyristors in existing equipment.</description></item><item><title>Ripple Free Modulation Method for Parallel Hybrid DC&#8211;DC Converter to Mitigate DC Link Filter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856685</link><description>The development of dc grids requires compact, economical, and efficient means of dc&#8211;dc integration. The parallel hybrid converter (PHC) is a suitable candidate for dc&#8211;dc integration due to its low energy storage requirement (ESR), soft switching, low submodule (SM) and switch count. However, the requirement of large dc side filtering and harmonic voltage injection (HVI) have been crucial limitations of the PHC.

Small-signal stability is a representative issue. Though, existing frameworks either ignore the uncertainties of renewables, or only focus on the worst case. In this regard, this paper establishes a small-signal stability constrained stochastic-robust optimal power flow (OPF) model, which aims to optimize the expected cost of scheduling results with respect to the probability distributions of uncertainties while ensuring the small-signal stability requirement even in extreme scenarios. However, the synergy of uncertainties and the complicated small-signal stability mechanism significantly increase the solving difficulty. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework to overcome this challenge. First, we solve the stochastic OPF without small-signal stability constraints. For those results that do not meet the stability requirements, we use them as initial points to locate the effective boundary of the OPF feasible region where the robust small-signal stability requirement is satisfied. The effective boundary location is realized in an iterative manner. Then, in the neighborhood of this effective boundary, we construct a linear surrogate expression to represent the original robust small-signal stability constraint with Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and sample weighted support vector machine (swSVM). Finally, we solve the OPF model with the surrogate constraint. Moreover, we further propose a constraint correction strategy to guarantee the stability requirement. Case studies verify that the proposed method can acquire economical operation schemes and meet the robust small-signal stability requirement at the same time.</description></item><item><title>A Self-Supervised Pre-Learning Method for Low Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839636</link><description>As wind power is becoming a major energy source of power systems, the risk of power shortages due to its intermittent low power output is growing. Accurate forecasting of low wind power is crucial for mitigating these impacts. However, conventional methods struggle with few-sample issues due to the infrequent occurrence of low wind power, limiting accuracy improvements. To address this, a self-supervised pre-learning method is proposed to forecast low wind power occurrence period and output, leveraging the similarities and differences among low output samples to enhance forecasting accuracy. Low wind power output is decomposed into low wind power events (LWPE), which represent the occurrence timeframe, and low wind power processes (LWPP), which represent the power sequences. For LWPE forecasting, a siamese residual shrinkage network based on contrastive learning is introduced. This network pre-learns LWPE features from sample pairs to mitigate the impact of imbalanced sample distribution. For LWPP forecasting, a pattern recognition-based embedded forecasting framework is proposed, embedding typical LWPP fluctuations into the prediction network to improve fit under limited sample conditions. A case study on 3 wind farm clusters shows that this method improves LWPP forecasting accuracy from 84.99%-86.6% to 89.97%, outperforming traditional methods without pre-learning.</description></item><item><title>Estimation of Stability Region for Grid-Forming Inverters Considering Switching Characteristics via Constructing Damping-Reflected Energy Functions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843855</link><description>Grid-forming (GFM) inverters have been widely used as the interface between renewable energy sources and power grid. During low voltage ride through (LVRT) period, to limit the fault current, GFM inverters will experience the switching of control strategy, which makes the transient stability of GFM inverters exhibit different features from that of synchronous generators (SGs). In this paper, considering the switching characteristics induced by virtual impedance (VI), the framework of predicting the transient stability of GFM inverters during the fault period and after fault clearance is established from the perspective of energy. To reduce the conservativeness of the stability region, a uniform energy function considering the damping dissipation and the dynamics of reactive power control loop is constructed for the transient stability analysis of GFM inverters. Compared with existing approaches, the stability region estimated by the proposed energy function can intuitively show the effect of damping, and effectively reduce the degree of conservatism in transient stability prediction. Finally, simulation and hardware-in-loop experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method in the transient stability prediction of GFM inverters with switching characteristics.</description></item><item><title>A Decentralized Demanded Power Tracking and Voltage Control Method for Wind Farms Based on Data-Driven Sensitivities</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10848501</link><description>Efficient power dispatch in wind farms (WFs) hinges on precise demanded power tracking. This study proposes a decentralized WF power tracking and voltage control method based on data-driven sensitivities (DDSs). This method relies only on local operational variables for model predictive control (MPC), achieving near-global optimal solutions. With a backpropagation algorithm, a new sensitivity calculation method is designed to yield DDSs by computing the gradients of a global mapping model (GMM). The voltage DDSs can be derived simply by calculating the gradient of the voltage GMM and can replace the voltage sensitivities in traditional MPC methods. The power DDSs establishes linear relationships between the power outputs of different wind turbines (WTs), simplifying the WF state-space equations to local prediction models for reducing the quadratic programming dimensions. The three control modes designed based on DDSs enable control without WF line parameters, reduce computational complexity, or combine both effects. The variable spacing constraint linearization method transforms nonlinear constraints into linear ones, addressing the nonlinear coupling between control variables. Testing on a WF with 32 WTs in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method comparable to centralized control methods.</description></item><item><title>Approximately Adaptive Distributionally Robust Optimization for Energy and Reserve Dispatch</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10849978</link><description>This paper proposes two novel paradigms of approximately adaptive distributionally robust optimization (AADRO) for the energy and reserve dispatch with wind uncertainty. The piecewise linear policy-based AADRO (PLP-AADRO) approximates the adaptive optimization-based recourse decision as piecewise affine adjustment, while the piecewise value function-based AADRO (PVF-AADRO) approximates the quadratic recourse problem as piecewise linear recourse problems. Moreover, an equal probability principle is developed to achieve a high-quality segmentation of the wind power ambiguity set. Consequently, the distributionally robust quadratic cost constraint can be decomposed into decoupled piecewise constraints, allowing the dispatch problem to be formulated as a less-iterative or even non-iterative program. The two-stage AADROs with polyhedron supported uncertainties are first recast precisely as tractable forms with semidefinite constraints, by employing duality theory and S-lemma. Then, the distributionally robust cost constraint in PVF-AADRO is handled by dual vertex generation, and the bilinear terms in both AADROs are addressed by alternating optimization. Numerical simulations verify the efficiency of AADROs in approximating the strict adaptive distributionally robust optimization, and their adaptability in different cases is discussed.</description></item><item><title>Inertia Transmission Control of Full-Power Converter Variable-Speed Pumped Storage System for Grid Frequency Support</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10852016</link><description>Full-power converter variable-speed pumped storage (FPC-VSPS) is a promising technique for flexible power regulation in small-scale distributed hydroelectric power plants. However, conventional vector control limits the synchronous motor of the FPC-VSPS from providing inertia support to the power grid. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces an inertia transmission control for FPC-VSPS based on the concept of DC voltage synchronization. Firstly, the control incorporates the DC capacitor power equation into the GSC control. To enable inertia transmission from the FPC-VSPS synchronous machine, the DC capacitor dynamics are fed into both the speed and torque control of the MSC. Secondly, a torsion spring-rigid body equivalent model is introduced based on the inertia transmission process, analyzing the effects of physical parameters, control coefficients, and transmission delays on the inertia transmission performance. Theoretical analysis and simulation results reveal that the inherent physical differences and transmission delay have a negative impact on the effectiveness of the inertia transmission. Consequently, a DC capacitor design method based on inertia matching is proposed, accounting for the constraints of physical inertia matching, system stability, and operational security. Finally, simulations and experiments prove the necessity of inertia matching and verify the effectiveness of the proposed control to cope with frequency fluctuations in both pumping and generating modes.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Grid-Forming Undersea Pumped Storage to Enable 100% Renewable Offshore Oilfield Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854915</link><description>To advance carbon reduction of the offshore oilfield power system (OOPS), the grid-forming undersea pumped storage system (GFM-UPSS) emerges as a promising solution. This paper introduces a novel framework for a 100% renewable OOPS utilizing the GFM-UPSS. Firstly, the control strategy of the GFM-UPSS is presented. It consists of the grid-side converter (GSC), machine-side converter (MSC), and reversible pump-turbine (RPT) to achieve frequency and voltage regulation. A steady-state model is then developed detailing the water head, power, and volume of the spherical shell. In addition, the paper explores the converter parameter impacts on the GFM-UPSS transient model and derives the closed-form solutions. With the steady-state model, an optimal sizing method is presented and economic advantages in the marine environment are studied for the GFM-UPSS. Finally, EMT simulations are conducted to assess the frequency &amp; voltage stabilities and verify the effectiveness of the GFM-UPSS in enabling a 100% renewable OOPS. The optimal sizing results show that construction costs, mainly for OWP, are dominated and are influenced by sphere radius, placement depth, and start-stop cycles, while a 2.5 capacity ratio between OWP and GFM-UPSS consistently emerges as optimal. Moreover, analysis of transient stability shows that it improves with higher frequency &amp; voltage modulation coefficient and lower virtual impedance. The impact of RPT and MSC, mainly on frequency regulation, is determined by the DC droop coefficient and turbine inertia.</description></item><item><title>A Coordinated Adaptive SMC Method for Frequency Regulation Control in Power Systems With Multiple Wind Farms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10855531</link><description>The extensive integration of renewable energy resources inevitably gives rise to the complex and uncertain power system, where the somber matter of frequency instability becomes apparent. This article presents a coordinated adaptive radial basis function neural network (RBFNN)-based sliding mode control (CAR-SMC) to reduce the frequency deviation and oscillation of the uncertain power system comprising multiple wind farms. Firstly, the SMC is aimed at establishing the upper layer control law of the frequency regulation controllers. Then, the uncertainties are represented with RBFNN, and an adaptive law is employed to estimate the uncertainties online rapidly and realize the free-chattering of SMC. Furthermore, since a single SMC is only capable of handling a single control input system, a power distribution law based on momentum is proposed to implement the multiple control inputs of the AR-SMC, and also coordinate the frequency regulation abilities of wind turbines and energy storage systems (ESSs). Eventually, the proposed CAR-SMC is validated on a modified IEEE 39-bus system. The simulation results demonstrate that CAR-SMC can enhance the frequency stability in the presence of disturbances and uncertainties during steady-state operation, as well as in under-frequency and over-frequency scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Ultra-Short-Term Spatio-Temporal Wind Speed Prediction Based on OWT-STGradRAM</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10869841</link><description>Taking into account the orientation and distance characteristics of wind turbine stations in wind farms can improve the accuracy of wind power prediction.

However, current methods are affected by the intermittent, non-stationary and stochastic nature of solar energy and thus cannot satisfy the requirement of high-precision forecasting. To this end, we propose a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) forecasting method based on bubble entropy and smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) regularization, called BesFCM. This method first utilizes bubble entropy to fuse two mode decomposition methods to improve the representation of PV data to capture effective features with significant stability and discriminative ability, then employs a FCM with a combination of fuzzy logic, neural networks, and expert systems to model solar PV power generation, and finally develops a high order FCM learning method based on SCAD regularization to alleviate the overfitting problem, enhancing the robustness and generalization ability of forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate that the BesFCM achieves the best overall performance on PV power datasets from multiple sampling intervals in multiple regions of Belgium compared to multiple state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness for solar power generation forecasting, providing support and reference for improving the quality of smart grid dispatch and reducing spare capacity reserves.</description></item><item><title>Analysis and Suppression for Temporary Overvoltage Considering Dynamic Interactions Between LCC-HVDC and Renewable Energy Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874178</link><description>Temporary overvoltage (TOV) severely restricts the development and utilization of renewable power resources (RPRs), especially when RPRs are delivered through the line commutated converter-based high voltage direct current (LCC-HVDC) system. To reveal the TOV mechanism for the sending system during commutation failures (CFs), the transient process of the system is partitioned into different stages, where the evolution of the system trajectories is analyzed. On this basis, the variation of AC voltage and DC current considering complex dynamic interactions between LCC-HVDC and renewable energy Plants (REPs) during repetitive CFs (RCFs) is clearly quantified. After revealing the impact of control parameters of both REPs and the LCC-HVDC on the TOV during RCFs, a collaborative optimization method for control parameters is proposed for TOV suppression. Moreover, when the blocking after the RCF tends to be inevitable, the optimal blocking moment is determined to inhibit the TOV caused by HVDC blocking. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods are verified with EMT simulations of a typical benchmark system.</description></item><item><title>Hybrid Modeling and Switching Control of Electric Vehicle Aggregation for Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10878811</link><description>The aggregation and control of massive electric vehicles (EVs) are crucial for grid frequency regulation (FR). However, challenges such as disordered charging, high computational and communication burdens need to be addressed. To this end, a hierarchical hybrid modeling and switching control method for EV aggregation (EVA) is proposed. For modeling, a hybrid state set for EVs comprising three discrete states and one dynamic state is established at the local level. The dynamic state's flexibility allows EVs to charge orderly while considering user demands. At the aggregation level, a Markov-based EVA state space model is designed, integrating the user's willingness-to-pay (WTP) index and hybrid state. It estimates the EVA's FR capacity (FRC) with a lower communication burden and reduces computational burden by simplifying control dimensions. For control, a model predictive control (MPC)-based state switching method is designed at the aggregation level, considering user's FR willingness and power cancellation issue. Furthermore, a predictive compensation mechanism is designed to address model parameter errors resulting from asynchronous control cycles. At the local level, a probabilistic response method is proposed for responding to dispatched control signals, which reduces battery degradation through the state of charge (SOC) based response probability generation. Simulation results validate the method's effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Coordinated Control Strategy for Enhanced Performance of Energy Storage System in Secondary Frequency Regulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879267</link><description>This paper presents a hierarchical coordinated con-trol strategy designed to enhance the overall performance of the energy storage system (ESS) in secondary frequency regulation (SFR). The strategy includes three layers: the system layer, the ESS operation layer, and the coordination control layer. In the system layer, a detailed frequency response model of the multi-area interconnected system is developed. The intrinsic mech-anisms of timing, depth, and the effect of ESS and conventional generating unit (CGU) in SFR are revealed through the sen-sitivity analysis of the power allocation factor. Furthermore, a sensitivity-based adaptive power allocation strategy for ESS and CGU is proposed, which improves the SFR effect while reducing the ESS power and maintaining the state of charge (SOC). In the ESS operation layer, the ESS is divided into two components for integration, employing a monotonic charge-discharge strategy to reduce lifetime degradation caused by frequent charging and discharging, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. In the coordination control layer, considering the power prediction and the ESS operating state, a SOC optimization strategy based on the double-input fuzzy control (DIFC) is proposed. It further dynamically corrects the power allocation factor based on fuzzy rules, optimizing the SOC level to ensure the bidirectional SFR capability of ESS under all conditions. The case studies validate the overall SFR performance of the proposed strategy with different scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Spatiotemporal Graph Contrastive Learning for Wind Power Forecasting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879260</link><description>Accurate and robust wind power forecasting plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and stability of the power system. Hybrid spatiotemporal forecasting models based on graph convolutional networks have received widespread attention due to their advantages in spatial feature extraction. However, these methods are susceptible to the quality of the generated graph due to data noise and missing issues, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning model based on spatiotemporal graph contrastive learning to address the above issues. Specifically, the model's encoder combines an adaptive graph convolutional network with LSTM to capture fine-grained spatiotemporal dependencies. To enhance the robustness of the encoder against data noise, we apply feature-level and topology-level data augmentation techniques to the model's input and design two contrastive learning auxiliary tasks from the temporal and spatial dimensions, respectively. Furthermore, to capture more comprehensive spatial correlations, we construct an adaptive graph by fusing the static graph with a learnable parameter matrix. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed model significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.</description></item><item><title>A Carryover Storage Valuation Framework for Medium-Term Cascaded Hydropower Planning: A Portland General Electric System Study</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884034</link><description>Medium-term planning of cascaded hydropower (CHP) determines appropriate carryover storage levels in reservoirs to optimize the usage of available water resources. This optimization seeks to maximize the hydropower generated in the current period (i.e., immediate benefit) plus the potential hydropower generation in the future period (i.e., future value). Thus, in the medium-term planning, properly quantifying the future value deposited in carryover storage is essential to achieve a balanced trade-off between immediate benefit and future value. To this end, this paper presents a framework to quantify the future value of carryover storage, which consists of three major steps: i) constructing a deterministic model to calculate the maximum possible hydropower generation that a given level of carryover storage can deliver in the future period; ii) extracting the implicit locational marginal water value (LMWV) of carryover storage for each reservoir by applying a partition-then-extract algorithm to the constructed model; and iii) developing a set of analytical rules based on the extracted LMWV to effectively calculate the future value. These rules can be seamlessly integrated into medium-term CHP planning models as tractable mixed-integer linear constraints to quantify the future value properly, and can be easily visualized to offer valuable insights for CHP operators. Finally, numerical results on Portland General Electric's CHP demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented framework in aiding medium-term CHP planning to identify suitable carryover storage strategies.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Hydrogen Production Dispatch of Networked Hydrogen-Based Microgrids via a Distributed Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884064</link><description>Hydrogen has drawn significant attention due to its long-term storage capability and wide industrial applications. How to efficiently utilize renewable energy to maximize hydrogen production of a group of spatially distributed electrolyzers is a fundamental problem urgently needed to be solved. This paper is the first to attempt to address the problem by proposing a hydrogen production dispatch (HPD) model for hydrogen-based microgrids with proton exchange membrane electrolyzers. Considering the limited communication and privacy requirement of distributed energy systems, a distributed hydrogen production dispatch framework is constructed. The original nonconvex optimization problem is transformed into a convex form. Furthermore, it is proven that the marginal hydrogen production benefit of each electrolyzer should be equal for the optimal hydrogen production dispatch via Lagrangian duality. By setting the marginal hydrogen production benefit as a consensus variable, a novel distributed consensus-based dispatch algorithm is developed, in which an event-triggered communication scheme is introduced to alleviate the communication burden. It is demonstrated that the proposed algorithm achieves linear convergence. Results of the case study indicate that the proposed strategy yields the optimal hydrogen production benefit, which is increased by 9.43% compared to on-site hydrogen production and demonstrates excellent solving efficiency especially for large-scale systems.</description></item><item><title>Transient Frequency-Voltage Support Strategy for VSC-MTDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farms Based on Perturbation Observer and Funnel Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884062</link><description>To address the transient frequency and voltage stability challenges posed by low-inertia offshore wind farms (OWFs) connected through voltage source converter (VSC) based multi-terminal high voltage direct current (VSC-MTDC) system, a nonlinear perturbation observer and funnel control-based transient frequency and voltage support (PFTFVS) control strategy is proposed for VSC-MTDC integrated OWFs system. This approach utilizes improved estimation ability of the observer and adaptive feature of the funnel controller to enhance transient support capability and disturbance rejection performance of the system. The strategy comprises three parts: 1) an adaptive transient frequency support and rotor speed control method for wind turbines is devised to enhance the frequency support capability of OWFs; 2) considering the energy storage capability of DC capacitor in VSC-MTDC system, a transient frequency support controller is designed for VSC station to swiftly manage transient frequency variations; and 3) utilizing the rapid power regulation ability of VSC-MTDC, a transient voltage support controller is developed for VSC station to enhance voltage stability and boost the power transmission capacity. Finally, dynamic simulations of VSC-MTDC integrated OWFs system are built to verify the validity and robustness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Integration of Electrical Energy Storage in Wave Energy Hardware-in-the-Loop Test Rigs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887246</link><description>This paper presents a design methodology for integrating an electrical energy storage unit into a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test rig for wave energy converters (WECs). Typically, the power production from WECs is characterised by pronounced fluctuations at low frequency and high peaks compared to the average. Wave energy test rigs should be able to reproduce these variations to impose realistic conditions to the device under test. Thus, the grid connection of the rig must be sized to cope with high peaks, and additional measures may be required to avoid disturbances on nearby loads and negative effects on voltage quality. The integration of electrical energy storage can smoothen power fluctuations and mitigate these drawbacks, while resulting in lower installation and operating costs. The design methodology indicates how to effectively size the storage unit and which technology to favour based on the type and duration of test campaigns. Numerical simulation results are presented for a dual HIL test rig and operational profiles of three different WEC technologies. For designs with energy storage lifetime shorter than the calendar life, sensitivity analyses indicate that the rig's annual utilisation rate and the level of accelerated testing have a significant effect on the storage energy requirements.</description></item><item><title>Station-Network Cooperative Optimization Planning of Urban Integrated Energy System Considering Heat Storage Capacity of Heat Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891182</link><description>Heat storage capacity of heat network in urban integrated energy system (UIES) has the potential to significantly improve the operational flexibility of the system. To obtain the optimal UIES planning scheme, a UIES station-network cooperative optimization planning (UIES-SNCOP) method considering heat storage capacity is proposed. First, a heat network operation model under constant flow-variable temperature considering flow direction depiction is established for solving the problem that the existing model cannot be directly applied to UIES-SNCOP because the flow direction of pipeline cannot be predetermined. Then, a radial structure-oriented topology model of distribution and heat networks is developed to ensure the radiality of energy supply network while also reducing planning cost. On this basis, a UIES-SNCOP model based on information gap decision theory and stochastic optimization is constructed to realize the co-optimization of the siting and sizing of energy station and topology of distribution and heat networks. Finally, a solution method of UIES-SNCOP model based on relaxation-contraction coupled McCormick envelope is proposed for effectively improving the accuracy of solution result. The planning of UIES is conducted on an urban topology containing 55 nodes to test the performance of the proposed method, and simulation results indicate that the proposed method outperforms other existing methods in terms of reducing planning cost, ensuring radial structure of the energy supply network, utilizing heat storage capacity and enhancing solution accuracy.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Adaptive Robust Model for AC Network-Constrained Unit Commitment in Power Systems With Uncertain Wind Power</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891662</link><description>With wind power being extensively integrated into power systems, its inherent uncertainty and variability pose significant challenges to the power system operational security. Traditional robust optimization methods capture the worst-case scenario, which results in overly conservative decisions, with insufficient considerations on AC network constraints in power systems. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a novel adaptive robust AC network-constrained unit commitment (AC-NCUC) model that considers both the AC network security and the uncertainty of wind power output in power systems. More specifically, a convex polyhedral uncertainty set is constructed to characterize the uncertain wind power output. Here, the conservativeness of UC dispatch decisions can be adjusted by modifying the size of the convex polyhedral uncertainty set. Then, we combine Benders&#8217; decomposition and Newton-Raphson methods to solve the AC-NCUC model for the optimal dispatch decisions. Simulation results on the modified IEEE 6-bus and IEEE RTS 79 systems validate the rationality and validity of our proposed approach. The proposed AC-NCUC model effectively maintains the system security while ensuring economic effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Power Control in Wind Farms for Gearbox Load Reduction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891746</link><description>Rapid power and torque fluctuations in time-varying conditions increase the fatigue load and failure rate of wind turbine (WT) gearboxes. In this study, an optimal power control method is proposed for a wind farm (WF) to improve the power flow and service quality, allowing the WF to track the power demand instructions from the transmission system operator while minimizing the fluctuations of vibration displacements inside the gearbox. A comprehensive dynamic model of the gearbox is developed by analyzing the transmission mechanism of key gearbox components, such as the planet carrier, planet gears, sun gears, and spur gears, describing the correlation between the internal vibration and mechanical torque and power output. Then, an optimal power control problem is formulated based on model predictive control to suppress the fatigue load while tracking power. Furthermore, a fatigue evaluation system is built based on the real-time vibration state inside the gearbox to characterize the service quality of WTs and guide the power generation of the WF. This approach provides a safety-oriented boundary regarding the WT fatigue load in the optimal power dispatch issue of WFs to suppress potential WT failures. Case studies in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Deterministic Forecasts and Prediction Intervals for Wind Speed Using Enhanced Multi-Quantile Loss Based Dilated Causal Convolutions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891745</link><description>With rising wind power penetration into power systems obtaining wind speed forecasts with associated uncertainty becomes crucial for better planning and dispatch. This study proposes an enhanced multi quantile regression-based loss function specially tailored to train models to generate both deterministic forecast and the corresponding prediction intervals. Though the regression architecture of the model plays an important role in extracting precise forecasts, however, its efficiency is often ignored which may be a downside for short term forecasting scenarios where model training time may also be a significant factor. The present study therefore designed a multi-scale dilated convolution-based architecture for enhanced efficiency. The architecture generates predictions at different scales which are combined using particle swarm optimization to obtain optimal forecasts. The model is trained using the proposed loss function on datasets from both NREL simulations and operational Chinese state grid measurements across three different locations. The proposed model exhibits excellent forecasting performance in comparative experiments with both simulated and real-world operational datasets.</description></item><item><title>Stability Region Estimation and Decentralized Transient Control for Parallel Grid-Tied Grid-Forming Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892023</link><description>Renewable energyes are highly penetrated in power system through Grid-forming inverter (GFMI). Transient stability of single GFMI system under severe grid fault has been thoroughly analyzed in recent years, but quantitative analysis for parallel grid-tied GFMI system is rarely studied. To fill this gap, the large signal equivalent model of parallel system considering the interaction between inverters is newly built. Based on the model, the Lyapunov function incorporating kinetic energy, potential energy, damping dissipation, and interaction energy is constructed for accurate stability region estimation. Then, the effect of control parameters on stability region is analyzed, indicating that increasing damping, reducing inertia, and lowering reference power of one GFMI can deteriorate stability margin of parallel GFMI system due to the enlarged interaction power, which is distinct from single GFMI system. For this, a decentralized transient control that adaptively adjusts damping, inertia, and reference power is proposed to guarantee transient stability and achieve low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) for parallel system without relying on communication, system information. Finally, simulation and experimental tests validate the correctness of theoretical analysis and the effectiveness of proposed control.</description></item><item><title>Aggregation Feasible Region of Full Power Spectrum Electric Vehicles Based on Polyhedron Projection</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10900425</link><description>The aggregation of electric vehicles (EVs) can take full advantage of the power flexibility of EV clusters, based on the aggregation feasible region (AFR) of EVs. However, existing aggregation techniques of conventional distributed energy resources (DERs), exhibit significant inaccuracies or require excessive computational efforts when applied to EVs with high power and small capacity. To solve this problem, an iterative method based on the high dimensional polyhedron projection principle is proposed to derive the exact AFR formula for the full power spectrum of EVs, and the limitations of the existing analytical AFR are revealed. The results reveal that the exact AFR is a set of linear inequalities, whose coefficients can be represented in binary code, and the complexity of the right side is linear with the number of EVs, making it highly conducive to programming calculations. Moreover, this paper proposes a simplified practical AFR based on the exact AFR, which reduces computational complexity. Numerical simulation cases demonstrate that the accuracy of this simplified approach is still higher than that of existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Matrix Adaptive Correction-Based Dynamic Dimensionality Reduction Method for Voltage-Related TSCOPF in Bulk Power Systems With High Wind Power Penetration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902439</link><description>Transient security-constrained optimal power flow (TSCOPF) is an important class of problems for system operation. Several challenges arise when dealing with bulk power grids, including the large size and complex transient voltage behaviors. This paper aims to address such hurdles by proposing a dynamic dimensionality reduction matrix adaptive correction (DDR-MAC) algorithm, which can effectively evaluate proper Volt/Var levels to guarantee secure system operation. First, this paper performs dimensionality reduction processing at the bus and device levels to obtain a low-dimensional model with dominant modes, which solves the problems of high-order and large computational volumes of differential equations. Moreover, a dimensionality reduction error assessment model is established to ensure reduced-order accuracy. Then, the reduced-order TSCOPF model is equivalently decomposed into a mixed-integer linear optimization model and a combined coefficient correction model for system dynamic constraints and steady-state nonlinear constraints. Furthermore, a secant/tangent sensitivity adaptive correction method is presented to achieve fast computation. The DDR-MAC approach is verified across differently scaled IEEE test systems and the Nordic test system and can improve computational efficiency by 49.07% while offering higher accuracy than traditional computation methods.</description></item><item><title>Decentralized Synthetic Inertia Control for Two-Area Power Systems With Wind Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10906542</link><description>Modern power systems may experience decrease in stability due to the increased integration of variable generation sources that depend on power electronics converters. A common control strategy is to incorporate synthetic inertia from wind turbines, typically using state-feedback control in a single-area power system model that assumes uniform frequency. As power systems become more interconnected, different frequency behaviors can emerge in multiple areas, casting doubt on current methods that do not consider multi-area stability. Furthermore, most single-area synthetic inertia methods ignore the limitations of communication systems in real power systems. This paper proposes a decentralized synthetic inertia control strategy for a two-area power system with wind power. This approach accounts for the actual behavior of power systems in different areas and the limitations of communication systems in real scenarios. Numerical results, derived from dynamic models using actual operating data from the Chilean Power System, demonstrate that the decentralized control performs comparably to centralized control in maintaining power system stability and optimizing frequency nadir. However, the decentralized control has the advantage of relying solely on local variables, eliminating the need for communication links between areas during operation.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Strategy for Frequency Regulating and MPPT for Photovoltaic Sources Based on a Novel Three-Parameter Characteristic Curve</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10907967</link><description>The large-scale integration of Photovoltaic (PV) sources may reduce system inertia and power quality, resulting in increased frequency fluctuations and diminished system stability due to lack of the primary frequency regulation (FR) capability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified strategy for frequency regulating and Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) for PV sources to provide ancillary services to the power grid. The strategy employs a specifically designed active power control (APC) method to enable rapid and flexible power adjustments of PV sources, with which further FR function may be achieved. The presented APC algorithm adopts an iterative technique with a novel three-parameter PV characteristic curve, making it possible to reconstruct the real-time PV generation model, clarify the relationship between the system frequency, output power, and operating voltage. Its high control accuracy, fast convergence rate, and strong explainability offer significant practical value. Additionally, this adaptive control strategy features autonomous switch between the FR and MPPT modes adapting to real-time irradiation changes, without the need for additional irradiation or temperature sensors. The integration enhances both solar utilization efficiency and the FR capability, while eliminating the controller transitions during operating mode switches. Hardware-in-the-loop tests validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Online Monitoring of Battery Degradation for Enhanced Power Smoothing of PV Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908680</link><description>In pursuit of a carbon-neutral future, the integration of photovoltaic (PV) power plants into the electrical power grid is expanding. Although beneficial, this expansion presents challenges due to weather-induced variability, which destabilizes the grid and causes voltage and frequency deviations. A viable solution is the use of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) alongside PV power plants. However, conventional controllers, which lead to uniform and frequent charging cycles, accelerate degradation and reduce efficiency in BESS. To address this, this paper proposes segmenting the BESS units into distinct charging and discharging groups, effectively minimizing battery cycling and enhancing their lifespan. The controller dynamically assigns batteries to each group based on power fluctuation forecasts using a power-sharing model. This model manages battery activation, enables inter-group support, and balances degradation by monitoring BESS charge levels and assessing battery health through an online system. This controller, coupled with a degradation balancing layer, strategically prioritizes units based on their cycling age. The proposed technique was rigorously tested and experimentally validated, demonstrating that it significantly reduces battery degradation to a maximum of 0.099%, in stark contrast to the up to 4.41% observed with conventional controllers.</description></item><item><title>State Transfer Induced Transient Synchronization Instability of GFM-VSC: Analysis and Improvement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909647</link><description>The operation mode of grid-forming voltage source converters (GFM-VSCs) may switch between voltage source mode (VSM) and current source mode (CSM) under some situations such as grid faults, owing to the current limitation control. During the mode-switching process, there is state transfer from the final state of the last mode to the initial state of the next mode, which impacts the transient synchronization stability (TSS) of GFM-VSCs. This paper primarily focuses on analyzing and improving the TSS of GFM-VSCs by considering the effect of state transfer. A novel transient instability mechanism is revealed through the existence analysis of equilibrium points. It clarifies that the state transfer may cause the operating trajectory during faults to bypass the stable equilibrium point in CSM before diverging to the next cycle, thereby resulting in transient synchronization instability. Besides, to further analyze the TSS of mode-switched VSCs considering the dynamics during faults, multiple Lyapunov functions are adopted to derive the TSS criteria and boundaries. It has been identified that lowering the minimum critical current and adjusting the saturated current phase in accordance with virtual power angle (VPA) dynamics can enhance the TSS. Therefore, a VPA feedback-based current limiting strategy is proposed to safeguard GFM-VSCs against overcurrent and ensure the TSS. The validity of the new transient instability mechanism and the efficacy of the proposed strategy are confirmed through simulations of a GFM-VSC connected to an IEEE 39-bus power grid and hardware-in-the-loop experiments.</description></item><item><title>Assessing Dynamic Reserves vs. Stochastic Optimization for Effective Integration of Operating Probabilistic Forecasts</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909649</link><description>Probabilistic forecasting is becoming pivotal in utilities' decision-making processes, offering an accurate portrayal of plausible forecast deviations as opposed to deterministic forecasting which only focuses on the expected forecasted variables. Two methods, dynamic reserve and stochastic optimization, have been used to integrate probabilistic forecasts into power system operational planning. Dynamic reserve predicts system reserve requirements based on observed (from historical observations) or expected (from probabilistic forecasts) uncertainty spreads. This approach has a low computational burden, but it is commitment and dispatch agnostic. Stochastic optimization, on the other hand, considers multiple scenarios simultaneously (from probabilistic forecasts), allocating recourse across the commitment and dispatch variables, but demanding high computational resources and time. The selection between these methods depends on utility requirements and specific situations. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of both methods using a calibrated real-size system representing the Southern Company for medium and high solar penetration levels. Additionally, it proposes a hybrid dynamic reserve and stochastic optimization approach with a risk evaluation pre-scheduling procedure to enhance decision-making.</description></item><item><title>Minimax Regret Robust Co-Planning of Transmission and Energy Storage Systems With Mixed Integer Recourse</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909558</link><description>The growing penetration of renewable energy sources, with intermittent and uncertain nature, brings new challenges to the secure and efficient operation of power systems. Expanding transmission networks and utilizing energy storage (ES) have been introduced as effective solutions to address these challenges. This paper presents a minimax regret robust co-planning model with mixed integer recourse for transmission and ES systems, designed from the perspective of a central planner. The model considers a polyhedral uncertainty set for future peak load growth, while uncertainties in wind farm expansion are addressed through internal scenario analysis. This approach will guarantee the robustness of investment decisions and provide the central planner with a clear picture of the maximum regret among all possible scenarios. Furthermore, the proposed minimax regret framework facilitates strategic planning for ES installation after the resolution of long-term uncertainties. In this paper, we reformulate the model into a standard min-max-min problem, in which the maximization level is only over uncertainties. Subsequently, a five-level solution strategy based on a modified nested column and constraint generation decomposition technique is represented to deal with the intractability and complexity of the problem caused by binary variables of transmission lines and ES blocks. The model is finally evaluated through comprehensive simulation studies to verify its tractability, practicality, and effectiveness.</description></item><item><title>A Dynamic Model-Based Minute-Level Optimal Operation Strategy for Alkaline Electrolyzers in Wind-Hydrogen Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912757</link><description>Maintaining the export power of wind-hydrogen systems within a stable range is critical for power system security. However, this is challenged by the mismatch between large time-scale of alkaline electrolyzer (AWE) scheduling strategies and the short-term fluctuations of wind power. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel minute-level optimization strategy for AWE operation. Developing effective small time-scale strategies requires a detailed consideration of AWE dynamics. To this end, we first introduce its steady-state electrochemical characteristics and third-order dynamic models for both temperature and Hydrogen-to-Oxygen (HTO) ratio. Based on these refined models, we develop an AWE optimization framework that enables electrolysis power to track minute-level wind power fluctuations by dynamically adjusting fine-grained variables, such as the lye flow rate, cooling flow rate, and pressure, at 1-minute intervals. To overcome the computational challenges posed by the detailed modeling, we propose an improved model predictive control (MPC) framework. This framework incorporates model simplifications to improve computational efficiency, along with an optimization-simulation iterative procedure to ensure operational feasibility. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed strategy extends the AWE load range by 13.8% and reduces wind power curtailment by 15.06%. Additionally, synergies among control variables enable the system to achieve a balance between operational efficiency, stability, and security, highlighting the potential of this approach to enhance the performance of wind-hydrogen integrated systems.</description></item><item><title>Promote Data Sharing in Integrated Power-Traffic Networks: A Coalition Game Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10910214</link><description>Accurately estimating spatial-temporal electric vehicles' (EVs) charging demands is crucial for the secure and economic operation of power systems. At present, the distribution system operator (DSO) relies on historical data collected at each charging station to estimate future EV charging demand. However, the station-level forecast disregards EVs' spatial correlations within traffic networks (TNs) and might suffer significant forecast error, forcing the DSO to make conservative scheduling at the expense of operation economics. To this end, this paper proposes to leverage cross-sector information (i.e., traffic demand data and network parameters in TNs) to enhance forecast accuracy and avoid over-conservative operations. To facilitate the data sharing among the DSO and TN data holders (i.e., traffic authority and navigation App. companies), we adopt the Coalition Game theory to uncover how these entities could cooperate to benefit each other, and to fairly allocate the extra profits (i.e., the operational cost reduction induced by the improved forecasts) among themselves. The conditional value-at-risk theory is adopted to model the risk-averse behavior of the DSO. In case studies, we reveal the non-negligible impact of TN condition variations on EV charging distributions. Moreover, numerical results show that sharing high-quality traffic data contributes to the reduction in DSO's operating cost by utmost 20.8% as compared to the current practice without data sharing.</description></item><item><title>An Optimization Framework for Component Sizing and Energy Management in Electric-Hydrogen Hybrid Energy Storage Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10915713</link><description>This paper proposes an optimization framework to address the component sizing and energy management problems in an electric-hydrogen hybrid energy storage system connected to a wind turbine. The total cost of the hybrid system is minimized using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In particular, four decision variables are optimized: the electrolyzer (EL) size, the supercapacitor (SC) size, and two parameters in the energy management strategy (EMS). To determine the power split factor for the wind power, the EMS introduces an artificial potential field (APF) and defines a virtual force based on the SC state of charge (SOC). Two APF parameters are optimized to tune the power allocation between the EL and the SC: the shaping parameter of the virtual force and the basis parameter of the power split factor. Since the cutoff frequency of the low pass filter (LPF) in the EMS is adaptively updated based on the optimized APF parameters, the proposed framework is referred to as the &#8220;OP-APF&#8221; framework. The effectiveness of the OP-APF framework is validated by performing MATLAB and real-time simulations. Compared to three baseline frameworks, OP-APF is more effective in reducing the system total cost, controlling the SC SOC, and alleviating the EL degradation.</description></item><item><title>Photovoltaic Power Prediction Considering Multifactorial Dynamic Effects: A Dynamic Locally Featured Embedding-Based Broad Learning System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916943</link><description>Accurate photovoltaic power (PVP) prediction is a prerequisite for the efficient and stable operation of new power systems. While existing research has extensively explored the relationship between global factors such as temperature, irradiance, and photovoltaic power, the local dynamic impacts of these factors are often overlooked, which may reduce the accuracy of predictions. To address this issue, this paper considers the dynamic interrelationships among multiple factors and proposes a dynamic locally featured embedding-based broad learning system (DLFE-BLS) algorithm for PVP prediction. Firstly, a novel dynamic phase space reconstruction method (DPSR) is proposed to characterize the dynamic properties of multivariate data. Furthermore, a dynamic local featured embedding (DLFE) algorithm is introduced to extract local dynamic features from multivariate data. Finally, by integrating the dynamic reconstruction and dynamic feature extraction processes into the broad learning system (BLS) framework, we propose the DLFE-BLS algorithm to improve the accuracy of PVP prediction. Case studies have shown that DLFE-BLS outperforms other models in terms of prediction accuracy. Additionally, it has the highest accuracy when applied to transfer prediction.</description></item><item><title>Optimal VSG BESS Sizing for Improving Grid-Following Converter Stability Under Various Dispatch Scenarios and Grid Strengths</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924310</link><description>As renewable energy integration increases, ensuring stability of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs) in weak grids is crucial, as grid-following (GFL) converters often become unstable under such conditions. Integrating virtual synchronous generator (VSG) batteries has shown potential to improve GFL stability, but determining the optimal size of the VSG required for stability remains an open question. Existing research typically relies on small-signal or impedance models for stability analysis, which are only valid at a single operating point and do not consider the full range of operating conditions, including various dispatch scenarios and grid strengths. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel methodology to visualize the system's stable operating region, offering insights into stability boundaries across various real power and grid impedance variations. Additionally, it introduces an optimal VSG battery sizing strategy that accounts for these variations, ensuring stability while minimizing VSG capacity. The strategy's effectiveness is validated through comprehensive PSCAD simulations, demonstrating its reliability across a wide range of real power and grid impedance operating points.</description></item><item><title>Fast Centralized Model Predictive Control for Wave Energy Converter Arrays Based on Rollout</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10923686</link><description>Centralized control of wave energy converter (WEC) arrays for grid-scale generation can achieve higher energy production than decentralized (independent) control, due to its capability of fully exploiting mutual radiation effects. However, the state-of-the-art centralized model predictive control (CMPC) is significantly more computationally challenging than decentralized MPC (DMPC), since the number of control moves to be optimized grows in proportion to the number of WECs. In this paper, a fast CMPC controller is proposed, whose idea is to optimize only the first few control moves while rolling out future system trajectories using a fixed controller. A linear, two-degree-of-freedom (2-DoF) controller with a sea-state-dependent control coefficient tuning strategy is further proposed to serve as the rollout controller. It is shown that the proposed rollout-based CMPC (R-CMPC) can maintain almost the same energy production as conventional CMPC under a wide range of sea states, while significantly reducing the optimization dimension (in the studied case, by a factor of 6), enabling ultra-fast online computation (about 40 times faster than conventional CMPC).</description></item><item><title>Energy Management of Multi-Energy Communities: A Hierarchical MIQP-Constrained Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10923740</link><description>This paper proposes a hybrid mixed-integer quadratic programming-constrained deep reinforcement learning (MIQP-CDRL) framework for energy management of multi-energy communities. The framework employs a hierarchical two-layer structure: the MIQP layer handles day-ahead scheduling, minimizing operational costs while ensuring system constraint satisfaction, while the CDRL agent makes real-time adjustments. The goal of this framework is to combine the strengths of CDRL in addressing sequential decision-making problems in stochastic systems with the advantages of a mathematical programming model to guide the agent's exploration during the training and reduce the dependency on opaque policies during real-time operation. The system dynamics are modeled as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), which is solved by a model-free CDRL agent built upon the constrained policy optimization (CPO) algorithm. Practical test results demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in improving the optimality and feasibility of the real-time solutions compared to existing stand-alone DRL approaches.</description></item><item><title>Complex Variable Design for Power Control of Grid-Forming Inverter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854804</link><description>The analysis and design of the grid-forming (GFM) power loop and decoupling control can be challenging due to the coupled high-order system, where active and reactive power controls are typically designed separately using a dual-input-dual-output model.

Managing frequency, voltage, and power dynamics in microgrids under varying conditions, however, poses significant challenges. This paper proposes an adaptive, data-driven secondary control framework for real-time tuning of hierarchical controllers in both islanded and grid-connected modes. The approach employs a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Virtual Reference Feedback Tuning (VRFT) method with a novel low-memory formulation optimized for digital signal processor (DSP) implementation. Integrated with a performance detector, it enables automated controller retuning during open- and closed-loop operations, ensuring robust reference tracking and dynamic performance under disturbances.

The results highlight the proposed method&#8217;s practical applicability, offering a scalable solution for microgrid management in real-world conditions.</description></item><item><title>Uninterruptable Hierarchical Distributed Coordinated Control Scheme of Islanded AC/DC Microgrid Clusters Under Grid-Forming Converter Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10974648</link><description>Grid-forming converter faults in islanded hybrid AC/DC microgrid clusters could lead to voltage and frequency instability risk in the subgrid, thus threatening system operating safety. To solve this issue, this paper has proposed an uninterruptable hierarchical distributed coordinated control scheme of islanded hybrid AC/DC microgrid clusters. Firstly, when grid-forming converter faults occur in a certain AC microgrid (ACMG), the interlinking converter connected with the faulty subgrid switches its control mode into grid-forming, providing stable voltage and frequency support for the faulty ACMG. Then, a two-layer coordinated control scheme is presented, where the first layer is designed for the remaining interlinking converters, and the second layer is designed for converters in normal subgrids and grid-following converters in abnormal ACMG together with its interlinking converter. By the control mode switch of the IC and the two-layer coordinated control scheme, accurate power sharing can quickly fill the power deficit in the faulty subgrid, and the voltage and frequency of the microgrid clusters can remain stable. Verification results indicate that with the proposed scheme, the islanded AC/DC microgrid clusters can operate uninterruptedly under different kinds of grid-forming converter faults.</description></item><item><title>Robust Consensus-Based Secondary Control for Microgrids Considering Communication Delay and Noises: A Kalman Filter-Based Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994544</link><description>To achieve the frequency and voltage regulation as well as active and reactive power sharing, the consensus-based secondary controls of microgrids rely on communication network to exchange signals between neighbor inverters, which may be affected by the communication delay and noises. Unlike the existing methods that focus solely on communication delay, this paper proposes a Kalman filter-based robust consensus control to address the communication delay and noises comprehensively. Based on the discrete differential equation of the signal transmitted via communication network, the multi-step prediction model of the delayed signal is firstly built by considering the prediction errors. The state space model is then constructed by taking the predicted signals at each step as the state variables while the delayed and noise-involved signal and its differential value are seen as the measurements. A Kalman filter is further designed to comprehensively handle the communication delay, noises and prediction errors to estimate the true signal generated from neighbor inverters. With the estimated signals of all neighbor inverters, the consensus control is performed to coordinate the grid-following and grid-forming inverters within the microgrid. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated with simulations and experiments performed on the modified IEEE-33 bus-based microgrid.</description></item><item><title>A Unified Directional Protection Element for Converter-Based Islanded Hybrid Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11006132</link><description>This paper proposes a unified directional element (UDE) for protecting converter-dominated islanded hybrid microgrids (IHMGs) relying on phase current samples. For the AC sub-network, the fault diagnosis component (FDC) is constructed by averaging the first-order derivative (FOD) of the phase currents at each line end over one power cycle. On the DC side, the FDC is obtained directly by computing the FOD of the pole current. The current direction of each phase/pole can be identified based on the first peak sign of the FDC. Once a disturbance occurs, the UDE is activated utilizing a startup unit, and the first peak sign of the FDC of each phase/pole is shared between both terminals of the line to differentiate internal faults from other disturbances or external faults. A phase/pole is being faulted if both values of the FDC at both sides of the line have the same sign. The developed UDE is verified by simulating the modified IEEE 33-bus IHMG on PSCAD/EMTDC. Several scenarios are carried out including load switching as well as external and internal faults. Additionally, the effect of different factors is examined, encompassing measurement inaccuracies and high resistance faults.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Power Flow Estimation for MVDC Distribution Systems Based on Physics-Embedded FCN</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945791</link><description>Maintaining high prediction accuracy with varying grid topologies poses a significant challenge to adopting neural network (NN)-based approaches for power flow (PF) estimation in medium-voltage direct current (MVDC) distribution systems. This paper proposes a physics-embedded fully convolutional network (PEFCN) to improve the accuracy. Physics-embedded techniques are incorporated in the proposed PEFCN through 1) architecture reconstruction, and 2) loss function reformulation. Architecture is reconstructed by input channel conversion calculation in a new physics operation layer. This process offers physical connections among the three input matrix channels (voltage, current, and line conductance). Three new physics loss terms are included in the loss function to restrict the outliers violating the limits of converter power ratings and terminal MVDC voltages. The two operations enable the FCN to achieve improved prediction accuracy and strong generalization capabilities. Five MVDC distribution systems, characterized by different dc voltage levels and topology configurations, serve to validate the superiority of the proposed PEFCN over other NNs in the PF estimation for scenarios involving both fixed and varying system structures. Moreover, a modified IEEE 69-bus distribution system is further used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed PEFCN for larger systems.</description></item><item><title>Non-Iterative Sensitivity-Based Switch Exchange Method for Distribution Network Reconfiguration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10960360</link><description>In this paper, a non-iterative sensitivity-based zsolve the distribution network reconfiguration (DNR) problem and ensure the security of the switch operation process, while maintaining the node voltage within the feasible range. The NSSE method involved the sensitivity-based network reconfiguration (SNR) stage and sensitivity-based power optimization (SPO) stage. In the SNR stage, the computational speed was improved by considering the dynamic voltage sensitivity with respect to the compensated power analysis, while the network power losses and number of switching times were minimized. The closed-loop and open-loop operation model was developed to solve the compensated power for simulating the switch operation process. Moreover, the maximum loop current was set as a constraint to avoid the equipment risk of switching operation. Each switch operation process can be formulated as integer quadratic programming (IQP) to obtain the optimal network topology and switch operation sequence with the non-iterative calculations. In the SPO stage, the active and reactive power outputs of distributed generations (DGs) were optimized to regulate the node voltage and reduce the active power curtailment. The effectiveness of the proposed NSSE method on the calculation speed and accuracy was validated in MATLAB.</description></item><item><title>Multiagent System-Based VPPs Cooperative Power Control for Frequency Regulation Considering Diverse Communication Issues</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10948420</link><description>Virtual power plants (VPPs) possess significant potential to support power systems&#8217; frequency regulation through the aggregation of demand-side distributed energy resources. However, due to their heavy reliance on information technology, VPPs inevitably face diverse communication issues, such as cyber-attacks, privacy disclosure, and packet losses, which poses a serious challenge to ensure efficient power control for frequency regulation. To this end, this paper proposes a multiagent system-based VPPs cooperative power control strategy to achieve frequency regulation in a resilient, optimal, and scalable manner. First, a joint design scheme of VPPs cooperative power control and information interaction mechanism is presented to determine the optimal regulation power of VPPs for frequency regulation, where a consensus-based collaborative strategy is designed for cyber-attacks and a homomorphic encryption technology is introduced for privacy protection. Also, an event-triggered mechanism is adopted for communication burden. Second, a dynamic power control scheme for inverter is presented to enable the internal units of VPPs to track the power reference from the joint design scheme, in which an improved model predictive control method is suggested for packet losses to enhance control performance. Finally, simulation results reveal that, when confronting diverse communication issues, the proposed strategy exhibits significant effects in defending against cyber-attacks, ensuring privacy security, alleviating the communication burden, and achieving fast response, thus effectively facilitating VPPs frequency regulation.</description></item><item><title>Voltage-Source Control for Green-Hydrogen Hybrid Energy Storage System With Operational Constraints and Current Rate Limiter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947357</link><description>Green hydrogen produced from renewable energy generation (RES) is facilitating the energy transition. Due to the complicated operational constraints of green-hydrogen hybrid energy storage system (GH-HESS), the existing two-layer power-based control architecture is prevalent, but it heavily relies on the communication infrastructure and the prediction accuracy of RES&#8217;s power. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel voltage-source hierarchical control framework for the grid-connected GH-HESS to solve the above problems. Considering the electricity price, the hot-standby current and safety of the hydrogen production of the electrolyzer, the current allocation between hydrogen energy storage and power grid is achieved for the continuous stable operation of GH-HESS even in the situation with potential communication failure. When the current rate limiter is adopted for the fuel starvation phenomenon of fuel cell, the current feed-forward loop and current-based secondary control are designed to solve the trade-off problem between the current overshoot and convergence speed of the tradition voltage-source control, where the large current overshoot will cause irreversible damage to hydrogen energy storage. Battery energy storage rapidly responses the power fluctuation from RES, while the steady-state power vacancy is undertaken by hydrogen energy storage. Finally, a 800V DC microgrid based on NI-PXI real-time platform is built to validate its advantages.</description></item><item><title>Reliability and Comfort-Aware Operation Optimization for Hydrogen-Based Building Energy Systems in Off-Grid Mode</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10965864</link><description>Hydrogen-based energy systems have gained wide attention due to their significant potential for relieving energy crises and environmental problems. However, existing studies neglect occupant comfort control in hydrogen-based building energy systems (HBESs). In this paper, we investigate a reliability and comfort-aware operation optimization problem of an HBES in off-grid mode. Achieving the above aim encounters several challenges due to multi-source uncertainties, implicit indoor environmental dynamics, temporally and spatially coupled constraints, and nonlinear constraints. To address the above challenges, we propose a physics-embedded neural network (PENN)-assisted hierarchical model predictive control (MPC) algorithm. Specifically, the PENN architecture is adopted to capture the indoor dynamics accurately. Then, the PENN-assisted upper-level MPC implements occupant comfort control and optimizes the multi-energy demands. Next, the lower-level MPC optimizes the system operation cost and reliability with known multi-energy demands decided by the upper-level MPC. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms baselines in terms of operation cost, system reliability, and indoor occupant comfort.</description></item><item><title>Exploring the Feasible Regulation Region of Building HVAC Systems Within Hygro-Thermal Comfort</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11006322</link><description>Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems are widely recognized as promising demand response (DR) resources for enhancing grid flexibility. Despite extensive research on evaluating the regulation capacity of HVAC systems, the role of humidity in air dynamic description and occupant comfort assessment during DR has been overlooked. This paper addresses these gaps by exploring the feasible regulation region of HVAC systems while meeting occupant hygro-thermal comfort. Firstly, a comprehensive model of HVAC systems is developed to describe the hygro-thermal air dynamics and equipment characteristics. Subsequently, the hygro-thermal comfort area is defined to establish permissible temperature and humidity boundaries. Based on key constraints, the hygro-thermal air dynamics are categorized into 3 distinct types. Moreover, a novel criterion is proposed to identify these dynamics without requiring full knowledge of boundary conditions. On this basis, the maximum regulation capacities are quantitatively evaluated to explore the feasible regulation region throughout the day. Finally, numerical case studies are conducted to validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that humidity plays a crucial role in the operating power and the feasible regulation region of HVAC systems. Incorporating humidity improves hygro-thermal comfort, thereby encouraging more occupant participation in DR programs.</description></item><item><title>Automated Fast Frequency Response From Inverter-Based Motor Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002578</link><description>The increasing integration of inverter-based renewable generation presents challenges for the frequency stability of power systems, primarily due to reduced system inertia and governor response&#8212;collectively known as Fast Frequency Response (FFR). Obtaining FFR from inverter-based generation requires reserving operational headroom, resulting in a lost opportunity to generate more renewable energy. Recently, inverter-based loads have been proposed as potential sources of FFR; however, critical gaps remain in the control algorithms needed to transform these loads into grid-supportive loads (GSLs) capable of delivering FFR. To address this gap, this paper introduces a novel algorithm that enables automatic, communication-free, grid-supportive behavior in inverter-based motor loads. The algorithm&#8217;s efficacy is demonstrated through comprehensive simulations and hardware experiments. Experimental results demonstrate that GSLs equipped with the proposed controller can provide FFR by adjusting power consumption, reducing it by up to 32% for a 1.8% drop in grid frequency and increasing it by 10.65% for a 0.4% rise, within 1.5 seconds in response to frequency events. By retrofitting existing, or designing new inverter-based motor loads with this controller, end-use devices can automatically deliver aggregated FFR without communication infrastructure, enhancing frequency stability in grids with high levels of variable renewable energy.</description></item><item><title>Bayesian Active Learning-Based Soft Data Space Calibration for System-Wise Aggregate Flexibility Characterization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945771</link><description>There have been growing interests in characterizing system-wide aggregate flexibility to support transmission-side ancillary services and promote large-scale integration of distributed energy resources (DERs). However, accurately characterizing the power flexibility region (PFR) at the substation interface is computationally challenging due to the heterogeneity of the DER devices and the need to satisfy network constraints, resulting in a nonlinear and unpredictable geometry. Therefore, this paper proposes a network-aware, near-optimal, and sample-efficient data-driven method. First, a bus-level PFR estimation model is proposed to aggregate local DER devices at each bus into an inner-box approximated region. Second, a feeder-level PFR estimation model is proposed to aggregate all bus-level PFRs into an outer-box approximated region. A Bayesian active learning-based soft calibration strategy is proposed to iteratively and interactively learn a decision boundary of the binary classifier as an improved feeder-level PFR while providing trustworthy measurement to system operators. Case studies on a small, illustrative IEEE system and modified IEEE 123 bus test feeder validate effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description></item><item><title>Aggregated DER_A Model Parameterization via Online Moving Horizon Estimation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10945798</link><description>This paper introduces a methodology for parameterizing the DER_A model using a novel smooth mathematical representation, simplifying the process and preserving accuracy in modeling inverter-based generator (IBG). The methodology employs an online parameterization process that can operate in real-time. The model parameterization process is structured into five sequential steps, each targeting a specific aspect of the DER_A model through moving horizon estimation. This approach adapts to systems with varying voltage and frequency support requirements by selectively applying each step. Simulation results on systems with both known and unknown parameters validate the methodology&#8217;s effectiveness. The online moving horizon estimation technique accurately captures the dynamics of the overall system and ensures that the parameterized DER_A model closely mirrors the real system&#8217;s voltage, current, and power dynamics. The findings highlight the potential of this methodology to substantially improve and simplify the dynamic modeling of power systems, paving the way for more reliable and robust IBG and grid integration.</description></item><item><title>Network-Security Informed Offer-Making of Aggregator With Utility-Owned Storage Lease Opportunity: Robust Stackelberg Game and Distributed Solution Methods</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10974673</link><description>Aggregators of distributed energy resources are increasingly encouraged to participate in wholesale market bidding. However, the delivery of the power they are awarded can result in over-voltage or congestion issues within the distribution network (DN). The opportunity to lease energy storage from the utility that manages the DN provides the aggregator with a means to mitigate these issues, while also benefiting the utility in terms of additional lease revenue. Nevertheless, this leasing opportunity considerably complicates the aggregator&#8217;s offer-making process, as it requires the consideration of market uncertainties, uncertain power injection at DN buses, and the strategic interactions between the aggregator and the utility. This paper presents a robust Stackelberg game model that effectively captures the interactions between the aggregator and the utility, ensuring DN security across all potential uncertainty scenarios. Furthermore, in light of the privacy concerns of both the aggregator and the utility, two distributed solution methods are proposed. The first method follows a traditional predict-then-optimize framework and has been validated to achieve the game equilibrium. The second method employs an end-to-end framework, which has been empirically shown to yield superior economic results. Case studies conducted on 69 and 533-bus DNs illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methods.</description></item><item><title>New Insights on the Stability of Sampled-Data-Based LFC for Power Systems: A Delay-Interval-Dependent LKF Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981893</link><description>This paper analyzes the stability problem of load frequency control (LFC) for power systems under uncertain transmission delays. First, an argumented LFC system model accounting for uncertainties in transmission delays is proposed. Then, a novel delay-interval-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) that takes into account both the upper and lower bounds of the transmission delay is proposed. Several less conservative stability criteria are derived using the proposed LKF. Based on the stability criterion obtained, the sampling interval and the upper and lower bounds of the transmission delay are taken as the conditions to guide the controller design. Finally, case studies are conducted based on a one-area power system and a three-area power system, both integrated with wind and solar power generation. The simulation comparison results demonstrate that the proposed LFC scheme exhibits strong robustness against uncertain transmission delays, load fluctuations, and the intermittent generation of wind and solar power.</description></item><item><title>Advancing Privacy-Preserving Wind Generation Forecasts With Selective Spatial-Temporal Dependencies Extraction, Encryption and Sharing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988895</link><description>The adoption of renewable energy sources (RES) is essential for accelerating the low-carbon transition. Accurate forecasting of renewable energy generation is vital for its effective integration into power systems, allowing for mitigation on variability and intermittency of RES and facilitating economic and secure grid operation. In this context, collaborative wind generation forecasting task faces multiple challenges, including secure information sharing, spatial-temporal dependencies characterization and utilization, as well as uncertainty quantification via probabilistic forecasting. To this end, this paper proposes a novel collaborative forecasting framework which features 4 core functionalities: a temporal convolutional network-autoencoder based secure data encryption and temporal dependencies extraction module; a self-attention based secure data sharing and selective spatial-temporal dependencies extraction module; a privacy-preserving collaborative point/probabilistic forecasting module based on improved pinball loss function; and an adaptive fine-tuning procedure to further leverage feature extraction performance and prediction accuracy through joint training. Case studies using real-world data from 10 wind farms located across Jiangsu province, China, validated superior performance of the proposed method while highlighting the value of the developed functionalities. The proposed collaborative forecasting method achieves 18.21%, 15.23%, 8.69% improvement in RMSE compared to the worst-performing baseline method, in benchmarking against individual forecasting, pre-training only and statistical pre-screening based methods. Furthermore, a maximum 26.62% improvement in Coverage Width-based Criterion is attained with respect to parametric and non-parametric baseline methods.</description></item><item><title>Robust Microgrid Dispatch With Real-Time Energy Sharing and Endogenous Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10999049</link><description>With the rising adoption of distributed energy resources (DERs), microgrid dispatch is facing new challenges: DER owners are independent stakeholders seeking to maximize their individual profits rather than being controlled centrally; and the dispatch of renewable generators may affect the microgrid&#8217;s exposure to uncertainty. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a two-stage robust microgrid dispatch model with real-time energy sharing and endogenous uncertainty. In the day-ahead stage, the connection/disconnection of renewable generators is optimized, which influences the size and dimension of the uncertainty set. As a result, the uncertainty set is endogenously given. In addition, non-anticipative operational bounds for energy storage (ES) are derived to enable the online operation of ES in real-time. In the real-time stage, DER owners (consumers and prosumers) share energy with each other via a proposed energy sharing mechanism, which forms a generalized Nash game. To solve the robust microgrid dispatch model, we develop an equivalent optimization model to compute the real-time energy sharing equilibrium. Based on this, a projection-based column-and-constraint generation (C&amp;amp;CG) method is proposed to handle the endogenous uncertainty. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed model and method.</description></item><item><title>Systematic Design of Active Power Control Parameters for Multi-VSG Systems Based on Active Power Separation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11003181</link><description>According to emerging guidelines, system operators are increasingly emphasizing three critical performance aspects from grid-forming (GFM) plants: active power-frequency (P-f) droop, low-frequency oscillation (LFO) damping, and active power setpoint tracking (APST) bandwidth. In GFM plants implemented by multiple virtual synchronous generators (VSGs), these performance aspects are dominated by VSGs&#8217; active power control (APC) parameters, i.e., the inertia constant H and damping coefficient D. However, an APC parameter design with these performance aspects comprehensively considered remains unexplored, potentially leading to inappropriate P-f droop, underdamped LFOs, or excessive APST bandwidth. To address this issue, first, by separating the multi-VSG system&#8217;s active power responses into a common part and a differential part, the analytical expressions for its LFO damping ratio and APST bandwidth are derived. Second, by aligning these performance aspects with the requirements outlined in representative GFM plant guidelines, a systematic APC parameter design method is proposed. This method explicitly formulates the feasible region for the APC parameters that ensures appropriate P-f droop, LFO damping, and APST bandwidth. Finally, real-time simulations and experiments are conducted in various multi-VSG systems to validate the theoretical analysis and the proposed APC parameter design method.</description></item><item><title>A Bi-Level Nash Bargaining Model for Electricity Trading Among Microgrids With Endogenous Nodal Prices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11006478</link><description>Determining a fair trading price is challenging, and this complexity is further heightened in power systems as the price must consider network constraints, fluctuating and endogenous electricity prices, and generation cost. This paper proposes a novel Nash-in-Stackelberg model designed to coordinate a collection of independently operated microgrids. Within this framework, the microgrids engage in a bargaining game to collectively decide a fair trading price as well as other operational decisions. We use the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) to model this interaction. Microgrids&#8217; trading decisions impact the locational marginal prices of the main power grid. Hence, a Stackelberg game is used to determine these prices. The Stackelberg model considers microgrids as leaders (upper-level problem) and the independent system operator as follower (lower-level problem). The NBS guarantees a fair allocation of the generated profit based on individual characteristics of the microgrids. In specific, in scenarios of higher generation, we achieve a cost reduction of  ${\$}$ 884 and  ${\$}$ 904 per microgrid compared with a grand coalition where only one microgrid receives the total cost reduction ( ${\$}$ 1788). Also we noticed that increasing the amount of solar-generated electricity reduces the nodal price in 1.53% and consequently the trading price in 1.27%.</description></item><item><title>Optimal PMU Placement via Quantum Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980373</link><description>Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are essential for real-time monitoring and improving grid observability. Determining the optimal PMU installation is critical, especially as the penetration of renewable energy resources increases, as the Optimal PMU Placement (OPMUP) can guarantee full system observability and reduce the installation cost. However, identifying the optimal PMU installation is a prototypical combinatorial optimization problem, requiring substantial classical computational resources. Furthermore, the significant expansion of the grid in terms of renewable energy integration makes the determination of optimal PMU placement increasingly computationally intensive. In this work, a hybrid quantum-classical approach, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), is developed to effectively solve the optimal PMU installation problem under normal and channel limitation scenarios. A tailored objective function is proposed for quantum optimization, which takes into account both PMU placement cost and system observability constraints. To analyze the observability of QAOA-generated solution distributions, recursion-based Depth-First Search and Breadth-First Search algorithms are proposed for normal and channel-limited scenarios. These methods determine solution feasibility on classical computers with  $\mathcal {O}(N+M)$  complexity, outperforming the  $\mathcal {O}(N^{2})$  complexity of inequality-based approaches, where N and M denote the number of buses and branches, respectively. In addition, the proposed quantum optimization framework can significantly reduce the computational complexity from the polynomial or exponential levels required by previous classical methods, i.e.,  $\mathcal {O}(RN)$  on quantum circuits and  $\mathcal {O}(R(M+N))$  on classical resources, where R is the repetition times of quantum circuits executions. The proposed method is tested on IEEE 9-, 14-, 24-, and 30-bus systems, where better installation results are achieved compared to the state-of-the-art results, providing a new baseline for further quantum studies in OPMUP. Furthermore, a landscape optimization strategy is introduced to improve QAOA solution quality. This approach also reduces the time cost of quantum computing resources, making it more efficient for current quantum applications. Additionally, parameter studies are conducted to identify key factors influencing QAOA performance. This work is expected to lay the foundations for addressing challenging power system problems through quantum technology in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Operation and Control Schemes of Retired Batteries in DC Microgrid for Secondary Usage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964325</link><description>The utilization of repurposed second-life batteries from electric vehicles in DC microgrids presents a sustainable and cost-effective solution. However, efficiently integrating these batteries within DC microgrids poses two main challenges: (1) poor consistency among retired battery packs; (2) fluctuations in the DC bus voltage. Traditional approaches primarily focus on achieving the state of charge (SOC) balancing within retired battery packs, often neglecting the suppression of voltage fluctuations, thereby compromising system stability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a virtual DC machine (VDCM)-based control strategy that enhances both the power quality of the DC microgrid and the consistency of retired battery packs. On the one hand, reconfigurable topology and SOC balancing strategies are developed to manage the equalization current, achieving SOC balancing within the retired battery packs. On the other hand, a VDCM strategy is designed to leverage the capacity characteristics of retired batteries to increase the inertia of the DC microgrid. Compared to conventional methods, experimental results show that the proposed strategy not only maintains SOC balancing during both the charging and discharging phases but also significantly reduces overshoot and settle times of dc voltage to 64.2% and 55.6%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>V2Sim: An Open-Source Microscopic V2G Simulation Platform in Urban Power and Transportation Network</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10970754</link><description>This paper proposes V2Sim, an open source Python-based simulation platform designed for advanced vehicle-to-grid (V2G) analysis in coupled urban power and transportation networks. By integrating a microscopic urban transportation network (MUTN) with a power distribution network (PDN), V2Sim enables precise modeling of electric vehicle charging loads (EVCL) and dynamic V2G operations. The platform uniquely combines SUMO for MUTN simulations and an optimized DistFlow model for PDN analysis, with dedicated models for fast charging stations (FCS) and slow charging stations (SCS), capturing detailed charging dynamics often overlooked in existing simulation tools. V2Sim supports a range of customizable V2G strategies, advanced fault-sensing in charging stations, and parallel simulation through multi-processing to accelerate large-scale case studies. Case studies using a real-world MUTN from Nanjing, China, demonstrate V2Sim&#8217;s capability to analyze the spatial-temporal distribution of EVCL and evaluate V2G impacts, such as fault dissemination and pricing variations, in unprecedented detail. Unlike traditional equilibrium models, V2Sim captures single-vehicle behavior and charging interactions at the microscopic level, offering unparalleled accuracy in assessing the operational and planning needs of V2G-compatible systems. This platform serves as a comprehensive tool for researchers and urban planners aiming to optimize integrated power and transportation networks.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Planning for Wireless Charging Lanes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10970087</link><description>The widespread adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) is significantly hindered by the long charging time and range anxiety resulting from slow charging speed and limited battery capacity. Meanwhile, wireless charging lanes (WCLs) and solar-powered EVs (SEVs) offer a promising solution by providing wireless and solar charging power while driving. Under this circumstance, addressing the optimal planning of WCLs while considering SEV operations is crucial for facilitating the widespread adoption of EVs. Considering the uncertain solar power harvesting of SEVs, we propose a data-driven two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) model for this integrated planning and operation problem. In the first stage, we optimize the deployment of WCLs with budget constraints, and the second stage determines the optimal operation schedules of SEVs under uncertain solar charging power characterized by a moment-based ambiguity set. To address the computational challenges (due to the discrete variables in both stages and the infinite-dimensional optimization in the second stage), we develop two approximation models and an integrated distributed method. Finally, extensive numerical experiments with synthetic and real transportation networks are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed models and algorithms. Specifically, the proposed DRO model achieves a 1.17% lower total cost in out-of-sample tests than the sample average approximation method, and with higher wireless charging power rates and increased battery capacities, we can build fewer WCLs.</description></item><item><title>A Real-Time Robust Method for Post-Disaster Load Restoration of Coordinated Power-Transportation System With Vehicle-to-Grid Response</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994444</link><description>With the proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs), vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capability emerges as a potential resource for load restoration after a large disruption. This paper presents a real-time post-disaster load restoration method for the coordinated power distribution networks (PDN) and urban traffic networks (UTN) with V2G response. The multi-period restoration problem is modeled as a dynamic programming-based multi-stage robust optimization model, addressing uncertainties of renewable generation and traffic demands. It incorporates a dynamic traffic assignment scheme to characterize vehicle travels and V2G services within short time slots. Then, an improved robust dual dynamic programming algorithm is proposed to solve the multi-stage robust optimization problem. For online application, the solved value functions from each stage serve as per-period policies, leveraging knowledge of future uncertainties to quickly guide real-time load restoration through distributed resource dispatch, network reconfiguration, and V2G assignments. Numerical experiments with a 33-bus PDN and 20-road UTN, plus a real-world 91-bus PDN with 35-road UTN, validate the effectiveness of proposed restoration method.</description></item><item><title>Best Response Learning Assisted Asynchronous ADMM for Real-Time Energy Sharing Under Communication Delay</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981894</link><description>Energy sharing can activate prosumer flexibility to support power system operations. However, in practice, communication delays are inevitable and seriously threaten the real-time energy sharing equilibrium. While many asynchronous methods aim to address this, they ignore the learnability of prosumer&#8217;s response and often struggle to balance convergence speed and stability. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel asynchronous algorithm based on best response (BR) learning. First, we demonstrate that the prosumer&#8217;s best response in ADMM-based energy sharing can be represented as the piecewise linear function. Besides, we propose a batch-fitting method to learn the BR function with high accuracy and low computational cost. Building on this, we develop an asynchronous ADMM algorithm with a practical error criterion to ensure strict convergence of energy sharing under severe delays. Numerical studies indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve faster convergence with fewer iterations and greater reliability across various energy sharing scales and asynchronous rates than existing asynchronous algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Data Aggregation Reconfiguration Scheme to Mitigate Stealthy False Data Injection Attacks in Energy Management Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10947360</link><description>Stealthy false data injection attacks (SFDIAs) pose serious threats to the stability and operation of power systems, with the potential to initiate cascading failures. These attacks depend on extensive access to system measurements, and the likelihood of gaining such access is closely linked to the structure of the system&#8217;s cyber-layer. However, the role of the cyber-layer in assessing SFDIA vulnerabilities has been largely overlooked in the literature, leading to oversimplified risk evaluations and suboptimal mitigation strategies. To address this gap, this paper first proposes a new cyber-physical risk metric (CPRM) to assess the system&#8217;s vulnerability to SFDIAs. The CPRM combines the physical impact of losing a transmission line-such as load shedding or generation loss-with the probability of such a loss resulting from an SFDIA. The likelihood of losing a transmission line is estimated by identifying all critical phasor measurement unit (PMU) sets, defined as sets whose measurements can be manipulated to stealthily overload the line. These critical PMU sets are determined using an algorithm that solves multiple bi-level optimization problems. Next, Bayesian attack graphs (BAGs) are developed for each substation and communication link to model potential access pathways and calculate the probability of compromising the identified critical PMU sets. Building on this analysis, the paper introduces a novel data aggregation reconfiguration (DAR) scheme that dynamically modifies the cyber-layer structure using software-defined networking (SDN) to minimize the risk of SFDIAs. Simulation results from the IEEE 39-bus test system demonstrate that the proposed DAR scheme significantly enhances the system&#8217;s resilience against SFDIAs.</description></item><item><title>Privacy Preservation for Cloud-Edge-Collaborative Energy Management System Using Post-Quantum Homomorphic Encryption</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980370</link><description>Cloud-based energy management systems (EMS) in smart grids face privacy challenges, as existing methods based on traditional homomorphic encryption support limited operations and are vulnerable to quantum attacks. We propose a privacy preservation method for smart grid energy management system, leveraging edge-assisted computing and ring learning with errors (RLWE) homomorphic encryption. Our approach enables both addition and multiplication operations on encrypted smart grid data while defending against quantum threats. We demonstrate the method&#8217;s security under the RLWE hardness assumption and validate its effectiveness through an experimental platform simulating smart grid environments. This work addresses computational limitations in current privacy-preserving techniques, enhancing data security for evolving smart grid technologies.</description></item><item><title>Node-Decomposition Privacy Preserving for Finite-Time Secondary Control of DC Microgrids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10980358</link><description>In the distributed secondary control of DC microgrids, achieving both rapid convergence and robust information security is critical for enhancing control performance and maintaining power quality. However, current privacy-preserving approaches often compromise either control performance or privacy preservation performance. To address this challenge, this paper presents a node-decomposition privacy-preserving (NDPP) method for fully distributed, finite-time secondary control in DC microgrids. By splitting each node in the communication graph into multiple sub-nodes, the method enhances both convergence speed and privacy preservation without sacrificing control accuracy. Sub-nodes communicate within groups, and the topology of the generated graph is concealed from malicious nodes and eavesdroppers. Theoretical analysis is provided to prove finite-time voltage regulation and current sharing with privacy preservation against malicious nodes and external eavesdroppers. Simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the method in maintaining control performance and power quality.</description></item><item><title>Early-Stage Anomaly Detection in IT-OT Power Grid Communication Networks Using Wavelet Transform and Hybrid Deep Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988657</link><description>In cyber-physical power systems, the imperative convergence of information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) engenders enhanced operational efficiency, yet increases susceptibility to cyberattacks. This scenario accentuates the necessity for deploying effective anomaly detection (AD) mechanisms to protect these critical infrastructures against the devastating impacts of cyberattacks. Traditional AD algorithms often focus on identifying anomalies through analyzing spatial and temporal patterns derived from the physical system measurements, an approach that typically proves effective only after a cyberattack has been successfully executed at the later stages of the cyberkill chain. This reactive approach fails to respond to evolving cyber threats. To tackle this issue, this article introduces an innovative framework for early-stage AD in integrated IT-OT power grid communication networks. Our approach models the IT-OT network as a traffic dispersion graph and applies wavelet transform to decompose the real-time traffic throughput of each information node into its constituent sub-bands to extract time-frequency features. These features are then weighted and prioritized using a graph attention mechanism and fed into a bidirectional long short-term memory for temporal analysis, ultimately classifying the nodes as normal or abnormal. Our experiments confirm the methodology&#8217;s precise detection and localization of active cyberattack sites, outperforming existing state-of-the-art AD models.</description></item><item><title>Observer-Based Finite-Time Fuzzy Load Frequency Control for Multiarea Nonlinear Power Systems Under Input Delays and Cyber Attacks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993468</link><description>This paper presents an observer-based finite-time fuzzy load frequency control (LFC) strategy for multiarea nonlinear power systems with uncertain parameters, considering the impact of cyber attacks and input delays. To tackle the nonlinearities and uncertainties, an LFC model incorporating multiple input delays is developed within the interval type-2 (IT2) Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy framework. In response to unmeasurable states and unknown false data injection attacks (FDIAs), state and attack observers are designed to estimate these unknowns, thereby enabling effective compensation for FDIAs during the controller design. Furthermore, an observer-based reduction method is employed to transform the multiple input-delay system into a delay-free one, which reduces conservatism. Sufficient conditions are derived such that the closed-loop system is finite-time stable with  $H_{\infty }$  performance. Finally, simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>A New Method for Stealthy False Data Injection Attack Detection Using Advanced Feasibility Areas Considering Spatial Distribution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11004030</link><description>The Feasibility Area (FA) in power system applications defines the region within which Power System State Variables (PSSVs) typically exist under normal operating conditions. Accurate characterization of the FA helps enhancing optimal power flow, detecting anomalies, and identifying stealthy False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs). Traditional FA-based approaches assess the location of PSSVs based on discrete time instances, using a binary flag to indicate whether the PSSVs lie inside or outside the FA. This paper introduces an advanced FA-based stealthy FDIAs detection method that improves upon this by incorporating the spatial distribution of PSSVs relative to the estimated FA. Unlike conventional methods, the advanced FA incorporates spatial distribution to evaluate the proximity of the current PSSV to the expected FA in the complex plane. A sigmoid-expansion flag is employed to represent the probability of the current PSSVs belonging to the expected FA, replacing the conventional binary flag. This sigmoid-expansion flag is then used as an input to a Deep Neural Network (DNN), where both the sigmoid-expansion flag and DNN model parameters are fine-tuned during training to ensure optimal compatibility, thereby improving detection accuracy. The proposed method significantly improves the detection of stealthy FDIAs, offering superior performance over traditional FA. Additionally, it enables the extraction of key attack characteristics, such as type, nature, and magnitude, further strengthening the system&#8217;s defense capabilities.</description></item><item><title>Carbon-Aware Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading in an Unbalanced Distribution Network via a Nash Equilibrium Discovery Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966432</link><description>Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading offers an innovative platform for prosumers to engage in bilateral electricity and carbon trades, enabling promoting the integration of distributed energy resources and supporting low-carbon operations in distribution networks. However, existing studies often rely on single-phase approximations, leading to inaccuracies in emission accounting and potential economic inefficiencies loss. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a carbon-aware P2P energy trading mechanism for unbalanced distribution networks. A novel joint electricity and carbon trading market framework is developed, integrating carbon permits trading with a continuous double auction mechanism. The trading process is formulated as a cooperative Markov game to capture the stochastic nature of market dynamics and to enable intelligent bidding decisions. A Nash equilibrium (NE) discovery multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework is employed, utilizing a trust region policy optimization-based algorithm to enhance trading reliability and policy interpretability. Simulations on a modified IEEE-123 unbalanced distribution network demonstrate the proposed effectiveness in reducing operational costs and carbon emissions, providing rigorous NE validation and showcasing its practical applicability in complex energy markets.</description></item><item><title>Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring via Binary Integer Search and Transient Load Feature Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10976991</link><description>Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) aims to analyze energy consumption and monitor loads without intrusive measurements. However, existing household NILM models often depend heavily on specific datasets or electricity usage scenarios, which limits their performance consistency across different households. To enhance adaptability across diverse households and regions, this paper proposes an optimization-based NILM solution consisting of two key steps: using binary integer search to determine a feasible solution space, and incorporating transient load features in the final solution selection. The proposed model only requires a few electrical parameters for each appliance, eliminating the need for device-level load training data. Tests on real-world datasets across multiple households demonstrate the model&#8217;s effectiveness in load disaggregation and its computational efficiency, making it suitable for practical applications. Furthermore, the model&#8217;s physical interpretability lays a strong foundation for further research and development.</description></item><item><title>RL2: Reinforce Large Language Model to Assist Safe Reinforcement Learning for Energy Management of Active Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016112</link><description>As large-scale distributed energy resources are integrated into the active distribution networks (ADNs), effective energy management in ADNs becomes increasingly prominent compared to traditional distribution networks. Although advanced reinforcement learning (RL) methods, which alleviate the burden of complicated modelling and optimization, have greatly improved the efficiency of energy management in ADNs, safety becomes a critical concern for RL applications in real-world problems. Since the design and adjustment of penalty functions, which correspond to operational safety constraints, require extensive domain knowledge in RL and power system operation, the emerging ADN operators call for a more flexible and customized approach to address the penalty functions so that the operational safety and efficiency can be further enhanced. Empowered with strong comprehension, reasoning, and in-context learning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) provide a promising way to assist safe RL for energy management in ADNs. In this paper, we introduce the LLM to comprehend operational safety requirements in ADNs and generate corresponding penalty functions. In addition, we propose an RL2 mechanism to refine the generated functions iteratively and adaptively through multi-round dialogues, in which the LLM agent adjusts the functions&#8217; pattern and parameters based on training and test performance of the downstream RL agent. The proposed method significantly reduces the intervention of the ADN operators. Comprehensive test results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Distribution Network Expansion-Friendly Adaptive Deep Reinforcement Learning for Inverter-Based Volt-Var Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10975829</link><description>In recent years, in response to the challenges posed by the volatility and uncertainty of increasing renewable energy sources (RESs), numerous studies have emerged on inverter-based Volt-Var control (VVC) using data-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. However, most of these methods assume fixed distribution network (DN) scales, which may not be applicable under potential DN expansion involving newly connected nodes and controllable devices. To address this issue, this letter proposes a novel DRL framework for inverter-based VVC capable of adapting to evolving DN environments. Specifically, state embedding for expanding state space (SE-ESS) and action branching for expanding action space (AB-EAS) are designed to facilitate model fine-tuning for the expansion of DN scales. Case studies on a modified IEEE 33-bus system validate the proposed method&#8217;s strong adaptability to DN expansion.</description></item><item><title>Aggregated Modeling of Massive Heterogeneous Building HVAC Loads for Demand Response: A Fluid Dynamics Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988639</link><description>The aggregation of massive heterogeneous building HVAC (heating, ventilation and air-conditioning) loads is essential for enhancing the flexibility of power grids in demand response contexts. However, practical challenges such as unavailability of load parameters and sensor update delays significantly hinder the development of accurate aggregation models. To this end, this letter introduces a novel fluid dynamics perspective to model the HVAC aggregation behavior under more realistic scenarios that account for these practical issues. A novel analogy is established to treat the HVAC population as a fluid system, enabling the aggregation dynamics to be intuitively captured through well-established fluid phenomena. Building on this perspective, a 2-D advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) equation-based aggregation model is developed. Case studies demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately predict the aggregated power variation under these realistic scenarios. In addition, control strategies guided by this model can accurately track the reference load regulation signal, with an average relative error of less than 2%.</description></item><item><title>Coherent Compensation-Based Sensing for Long-Range Targets in Integrated Sensing and Communication System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887024</link><description>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a promising candidate technology for 6G due to its improvement in spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal is a mainstream candidate ISAC waveform. However, there are inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) when the round-trip delay exceeds the cyclic prefix (CP) duration for OFDM signals, which limits the maximum sensing range of ISAC system. When detecting a long-range target, the wide beam inevitably covers the close-range target, of which the echo's power is much larger than that of the long-range target. In order to tackle the above problem, a multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and least squares (LS)-based spatial signal separation method is proposed to separate the echo signals reflected from different targets. Moreover, a coherent compensation-based sensing signal processing method at the receiver is proposed to enhance the signal to interference plus noise power ratio (SINR) of the OFDM block for generating the range-Doppler map (RDM) with higher SINR. Simulation results reveal that the proposed method greatly enhances the SINR of RDM by 10 dB for a target at 500 m compared with two-dimensional fast Fourier transform (2D-FFT) method. Besides, the detection probability is also significantly improved compared to the benchmarking method.</description></item><item><title>Toward Energy-Efficient Dynamic Resource Allocation in Uplink NOMA Systems: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Single and Multi-Cell NOMA Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10882994</link><description>Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a key technology for future wireless networks, enabling improved spectral efficiency and massive device connectivity. However, optimizing power allocation, subchannel assignment, and cell association in multi-cell uplink NOMA systems is challenging due to user mobility and the NP-hard nature of the problem. This paper addresses these challenges by formulating the problem as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model to maximize energy efficiency (EE). We propose a deep reinforcement learning framework that employs deep Q-networks (DQN) for cell association and subchannel assignment, and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) for power allocation. Simulation results reveal significant EE improvements, with multi-agent TD3 (MATD3) outperforming traditional Lagrange methods and multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG). Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits robust adaptability to user mobility and superior performance in multi-cell environments, effectively mitigating inter-cell interference and enhancing resource allocation in dynamic scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Learning-Based Task-Centric Multi-User Semantic Communication Solution for Vehicle Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887356</link><description>With the application of 5G in in-vehicle network scenarios, the inevitable crisis of scarcity of communication resources is deepening. At the same time, considering the high demands for communication delay in vehicular network scenarios, it is essential to meet the requirements for reliable information transmission in high-speed mobility environments. To address these issues, we propose the Task-Centric Multi-User Semantic Communication (TCMSC) solution, designed to meet the energy consumption and transmission time delay requirements in line with the new paradigm of semantic communication. Our solution introduces a task-centric semantic processing model aimed at improving Semantic Spectral Efficiency (S-SE). The TCMSC solution is tailored for multi-service vehicle scenarios, optimizing power consumption and enhancing reliability, making it well-suited for challenging environments. Moreover, we propose a novel method using Stochastic Network Calculus (SNC) to accurately model semantic task delay and calculate the upper bound of Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) delay-bound violation probability. However, to tackle the increased optimization complexity from SNC while simultaneously enhancing feature extraction, we propose the Transformer Advantage Actor Critic (TR-A2C) algorithm. This algorithm leverages the Transformer to capture dynamic vehicle parameters across scenarios, accelerating the TCMSC solution. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional single-service vehicle dispatch, TCMSC improves delay violation probability by ${2.88\%}$ and reduces power consumption by ${31.1\%}$, all while effectively enhancing S-SE in complex traffic environments.</description></item><item><title>Resource Allocation for Dynamic TDD-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884055</link><description>In this paper, we investigate a dynamic time division duplex (DTDD) enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, in which access points (APs) mode, bandwidth and transmit power can be flexibly configured. To obtain the best tradeoff between communication and sensing performance, we maximize the sum of downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmission rates under the constraints of Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and the maximal transmit power by jointly optimizing the power/subcarrier allocation and APs mode selection. To deal with the proposed nonconvex problem, we adopt the alternating optimization (AO) method to divide the original problem into two subproblems. The first subproblem is related to power/subcarriers allocation, which is equivalently transformed into a Semidefinite Programming (SDP) problem and eventually solved by the penalized convex-concave procedure (PCCP) method. The second subproblem is a quadratic integer problem related to APs mode selection, which is transformed into a convex quadratic integer problem that can be efficiently solved by the convex optimization toolbox. The numerical results demonstrate the tradeoff between the total transmission rate and sensing performance with different parameter configurations. Compared with existing schemes, our proposed scheme has significant advantages in terms of tradeoff performance.</description></item><item><title>Pattern-Domain NOMA-Based Orthogonal Time Frequency Space Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884046</link><description>Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is envisioned as a highly promising modulation technique due to its superior performance in high-mobility scenarios. Meanwhile, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) stands out as a key contender for enhancing spectral efficiency and reducing transmission delay. In this paper, we amalgamate the pattern division multiple access (PDMA), recognized as an appealing NOMA scheme, with OTFS, coined as OTFS-PDMA, to leverage the benefits of both technologies and address the low-latency and massive connectivity demands of sixth-generation (6G) networks. Specifically, we first reformulate the input-output relations in the delay-Doppler domain for localized and distributed-mapping-based OTFS-PDMA systems featuring various PDMA pattern allocation schemes. Then, we propose a low-complexity power vector expectation propagation detection algorithm (PV-EPA) for OTFS-PDMA schemes operating in spatially correlated channels. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed OTFS-PDMA scheme offers substantial performance improvements over the conventional OTFS-OMA scheme. For irregular PDMA patterns, localized mapping-based OTFS-PDMA schemes exhibit superior performance relative to their distributed counterparts. Additionally, the proposed PV-EPA receiver shows remarkable robustness against channel correlation and achieves a favorable trade-off between performance and complexity.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Distributed Beamforming Scheme Based on Phase Adjustment and Dynamic Tracking for LEO Satellite Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884878</link><description>Among LEO satellites communications, satellite direct connectivity to User Equipment (UE) has drawn much attention for its ability of providing basic emergent services. However, the link budget shortage resulting from long propagation length limits the capacity of communications. Distributed beamforming is a solution that provides high power gain by utilizing multiple transmitters simultaneously. This work presents a novel distributed beamforming scheme for LEO satellites direct connectivity services that can provide high power gain for multiple ground UEs with arbitrary locations and numbers. Firstly, an algorithm is designed for static satellites. By selecting satellites from a set of available ones and optimizing the transmit phases of electromagnetic waves on satellites, all the ground UEs can receive power gains improvement. Furthermore, this work considers satellite motions by proposing a fast algorithm that adjusts phases according to changing satellite locations. Finally, a satellite re-selection process is designed to ensure stable power improvement when satellites become unavailable due to their motions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our design. For four static satellites and 10 UEs, we examine 20 cases with different satellite and UE locations. Results show that UEs receive an average of at least 7 dB power gain in most cases. The condition of four moving satellites is also tested, and results demonstrate that all 10 UEs can have consistent receiving power gain as satellites move quickly.</description></item><item><title>Fading Evaluation in a Robust Spectrum Sensing System Based on Phase Difference Distribution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884811</link><description>In this paper, we delve deeper into a blind and robust spectral sensing technique, namely cosine feature recognition detection (CRD), based on the phase difference distribution of the received signal.

We derive closed-form formulas for the probability of detection and asymptotic expressions for the probability of miss detection considering the mentioned fading models and evaluate the performance of the CRD spectrum sensing system under various propagation conditions. We quantify the achievable diversity order and coding gain as a function of the propagation parameters. We draw conclusions about how each physical propagation phenomenon affects this promising spectrum sensing technique and compare its performance against the energy detector (ED) technique under a realistic scenario with severe fading conditions, noise uncertainty, and frequency mismatch, highlighting the potential of the CRD algorithm for practical implementation. Additionally, a Hybrid ED-CRD technique is proposed, which improves the detection capability of the CRD without increasing the number of collected samples.</description></item><item><title>Ergodic Capacity Analysis of MSK-Type Signal-Based Uplink Asynchronous NOMA With Imperfect CSI and SIC Over Generalized Fading Channels</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884903</link><description>Recently, asynchronous non-orthogonal multiple access (ANOMA), that can further enhance the performance of NOMA, has gained much attention. Considering the demands of resource-constrained wireless communications and green communications, power-efficient minimum shift keying-type (MSK-type) signals have also been introduced into uplink ANOMA, but they are only for a basic flat fading channel and perfect conditions. In this paper, an uplink ANOMA based on MSK-type signals with imperfect channel state information and successive interference cancellation over generalized fading channels is proposed, and its ergodic capacity is investigated. Specifically, the system model is first established. Then, a moment generating function (MGF)-based ergodic capacity expression applicable to general fading channels with known MGF is derived. Based on the expression, the integral expressions for the ergodic capacity over Rayleigh and Rician fading channels are exactly derived, respectively, and their closed-form expressions are also provided by exploiting the Gauss-Laguerre method. Further, their expressions with perfect conditions, asymptotic expressions at high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and high SNR slopes are also derived. The accuracy of the expression is verified by numerical and simulation results. It also shows the superiority of the proposed scheme over conventional OMA and ANOMA with linear modulation, and the relationship between system performance and time offsets, imperfect conditions, channel differences, and modulation formats.</description></item><item><title>Efficient Cache Retrieving Scheme in VANET via Online Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887034</link><description>The implementation of intelligent driving technology is inseparable from reliable wireless communication and efficient cache scheduling in Vehicle Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs). The purpose of cache scheduling in VANETs is to provide efficient and fast data services to vehicles. In response to difficult to handle wireless communication interference and high requirements for communication delay and energy consumption optimization in vehicle-road cooperation, we propose a new communication model of &#8220;Retrieving-Cast&#8221; to simplify the cache scheduling process oriented by data requirements. In V2I mode, consider the uplink of all roadside units(RSUs) retrieving data from vehicles, and prioritize data retrieving based on factors such as the number, density, and urgency of vehicles within the communication coverage range of RSUs. We hope that as many high-priority RSUs as possible to complete cached data retrieving as soon as possible under wireless communication interference. To overcome the limitations of traditional heuristic algorithms with low scheduling efficiency and deep learning methods requiring a large amount of training data, we propose a double-$\varepsilon$ online reinforcement learning method, which efficiently solves the cache retrieval scheduling problem. Through experiments and analysis, our method achieved better scheduling results compared to traditional approximation algorithms and single $\varepsilon$-greedy Deep Q-learning methods. The designed data transformation method also addresses the issue of requiring a large amount of training data, enabling rapid computation of scheduling requests in the network at an extremely low training cost, meeting the low-latency computation requirements in VANETs.</description></item><item><title>Delay Minimization for NOMA-MEC Offloading in ABS-Aided Maritime Communication Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884688</link><description>As maritime activities increase, the demand for high-speed, low-latency communications and efficient task processing in maritime communication networks (MCNets) intensifies. Currently, sea-surface communications and tasks mainly depend on on-shore base stations, which have limited coverage, and marine satellites, which offer broader reach but cannot provide high-speed connections and are costly. Motivated by the above, we investigate the deployment of air base stations (ABSs) in MCNets to offer flexible coverage and handle maritime-specific tasks. ABS-aided MCNets benefit from the integration of mobile edge computing (MEC) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques. Specifically, by optimizing the task offloading and resource allocation, we formulate a total task processing delay minimization problem under the constraints of task time-to-live (TTL) and successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding threshold. Since the formulated problem is non-convex, we decouple it and solve it iteratively. The channel allocation, power control, offloading ratio, and computation resource allocation are tackled in turn. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing schemes in reducing the total task processing delay. Notably, the incorporation of NOMA markedly enhances the task offloading rate, further decreasing the total task processing delay. The proposed scheme cuts the total task processing delay by at least 7.7% compared to the state-of-the-art schemes and by 40.9% against the local computing benchmark. Additionally, the performance of the proposed scheme, including its complexity, convergence, and the performance loss due to iterative optimization, is analyzed.</description></item><item><title>A Learning-Based Stochastic Game for Energy Efficient Optimization of UAV Trajectory and Task Offloading in Space/Aerial Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891825</link><description>In this paper, we study the energy-efficient unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and low earth orbital (LEO) satellite assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) in space&#8211;air&#8211;ground integrated networks (SAGINs).

To address it, UAVs are first allowed to adjust their trajectories to accommodate as many tasks as possible from IoT devices. Subsequently, UAVs compute a portion of these tasks while delegating the rest to LEO satellites for further execution. Accordingly, we formulate a joint optimization problem including UAV trajectory planning, task offloading, and bandwidth allocations, aiming to maximize the long-term energy efficiency of UAVs and LEO satellites (i.e., the total data size in computation offloading divided by energy consumption of UAVs and LEO satellites). Considering the interactions among intelligent UAVs, this problem is reformulated as a set of interconnected multi-agent stochastic games, and the existence of corresponding Nash Equilibrium (NE) is theoretically proved. To obtain the NE, a multi-agent reinforcement learning-based algorithm, namely UTPTR, is developed concerning system dynamics and uncertainties. Simulations evaluate the performance of the UTPTR and demonstrate its superiority compared to existing approaches.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Agent RL for Sleep Mode and Antenna Configuration With User Offloading Under Dynamic Traffic in Massive MIMO Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884953</link><description>In this paper, we focus on minimizing the total energy consumption of multi-cell massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks while simultaneously guaranteeing user quality of service (QoS). This is achieved by optimizing the multi-level advanced sleep modes (ASM), antenna switching, and user association of the base stations (BSs). Due to the interdependence of user association and inter-cell interference in the network, collaborative efforts among individual BSs become imperative. The problem is modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP) and a multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm is proposed to obtain a collaborative BS control policy. Simulation results demonstrate that the obtained policy can significantly improve network energy efficiency, adaptively switch the BSs into different depths of sleep, reduce inter-cell interference, and maintain good QoS compared to the two benchmark algorithms. The results also validate that enabling user offloading among BSs can improve both user QoS and system performance. The superiority of MAPPO is further affirmed by comparing it with the single-agent deep Q network (DQN) algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Power Allocation Strategy of Multi-Static Radar Network Tracking Maneuvering Jammer Based on Stackelberg Game</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884788</link><description>This article investigates a power allocation strategy and performs a game equilibrium analysis for tracking a self-defense jammer in a multi-static radar network with non-ideal detection performance. Specifically, the main objective of multi-static radar network is to maximize the jammer tracking accuracy under power constraints, whereas the jammer aims to minimize the index. The closed-form expression for the Bayesian Cram&#233;r-Rao Lower Bound(BCRLB) with radiation power as variable in the non-ideal detection environment is derived and adopted as the criterion function. Then, the multi-static radar network and the jammer are taken as the leader and follower based on Stackelberg game, and the power allocation model is established to optimize their power resources. Finally, by integrating the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and cyclic minimization algorithm, an iterative two-step solution is developed to tackle the power allocation problem between two players in the game efficiently, and the existence and uniqueness of the Stackelberg game equilibrium are derived.</description></item><item><title>Two-Timescale Optimization for E2E Network Slicing-Aided Cloud-Edge Collaborative Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891194</link><description>To leverage the synergy between cloud computing (CC) and edge computing (EC) to support various services while reducing the CC/EC switching overhead, the two-timescale utility maximization problem for an end-to-end network slicing-aided cloud-edge collaborative network (E2E-CECN) is formulated covering both the high throughput and low delay service requirements. To solve the utility maximization problem while dynamically adjusting the weights of the E2E-CECN utility to accommodate the variation of users' service requests, we proposed a reward comparison double deep Q network algorithm to optimize the large timescale joint virtual basestation activation and CC-EC scheduling, and a reward comparison deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm to optimize the small timescale allocation of backhaul link capacity (BLC), CC/EC capability and transmission power. Numerical results show that both the high-throughput and low-delay service requirements can be satisfied simultaneously under the reasonable BLC usage and power consumption.</description></item><item><title>An Evolutionary Approach for Multiple Flying Base Stations Deployment in NOMA-Based Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891177</link><description>This paper addresses the problem of deploying a Non-Terrestrial Network (NTN) using multiple Flying Base Stations (FBSs) to serve multiple Stationary Ground Users (SGUs). Our objectives are to minimize the number of active FBSs, reduce overlapping coverage areas, and increase data rates for SGUs. We formulate this as a multi-objective, non-convex Non-Linear Mixed Integer Programming (NLMIP) problem, incorporating both deployment and resource allocation practical constraints. To manage the problem's complexity, we decompose it into two sub-problems: FBS deployment and resource allocation optimization. To optimize the 2D deployment of FBSs in horizontal space, we propose a general, low-complexity heuristic method based on a statistical variant of the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm, named Evolutionary Bayesian SOM (EBSOM). Then, utilizing a Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) communication scheme between FBSs and SGUs, we maximize the downlink sum rate while adhering to constraints on FBS positions, transmission power, and bandwidth availability. In this stage, the deployment of FBSs is further refined to enhance resource allocation by dividing the problem into two non-convex sub-problems, which are solved iteratively using Surrogate Optimization (SO). Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy, particularly in reducing the number of active FBSs, minimizing overlapping areas, and improving network sum rates.</description></item><item><title>Spatial Multiplexing Oriented Channel Reconfiguration in Multi-IRS Aided MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10897933</link><description>Spatial multiplexing plays a significant role in improving the capacity of multiple-input&#8211;multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems. To improve the spectral efficiency (SE) of a point-to-point MIMO system, we exploit the channel reconfiguration capabilities provided by multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) to enhance the spatial multiplexing. Unlike most existing works, we address both the issues of the IRSs placement and elements allocation. To this end, we first introduce an orthogonal placement strategy to mitigate channel correlation, thereby enabling interference-free multi-stream transmission. Subsequently, we propose a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based approach to jointly optimize the IRS elements and power allocation. Our theoretical analysis unveils that equal IRS elements/power allocation scheme becomes asymptotically optimal as the number of IRS elements and transmit power tend to be infinite. Numerical results demonstrate that when the total number of IRS elements or the power exceeds a certain threshold, a multi-IRS assisted system outperforms a single IRS configuration.</description></item><item><title>Symbol-Level Channel Pattern Optimization for Reconfigurable MU-MISO Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891189</link><description>In this paper, we propose a symbol-level channel pattern optimization (SLCPO) scheme for pattern reconfigurable (PR) multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) communication systems. Unlike existing transmission schemes that treat the channel as invariant, this work proposes to actively adjust the radiation power of each scattering path of the wireless channel by adjusting the radiation pattern of the transmit array, thereby removing the limitations that communications can only adapt to the wireless channel passively. We separate the optimization into two stages. In the first stage, an optimization problem on the channel matrix aimed at maximizing the worst user's quality-of service (QoS) without investing additional signal power is formulated. Given the non-convex nature of the formulated problem, we design an alternating optimization algorithm, and obtain the channel covariance matrix that achieves optimal performance for each transmission symbol slot. This structure, proven to be optimal, provides key theoretical insights into the ideal channel conditions for symbol-level precoding (SLP). In the second stage, we propose the radiation pattern design in reconfigurable MU-MISO communication systems, where communication channels are jointly decided by the radiation pattern of the transmit array and the physical propagation channel, aligning the practical pattern channel with the theoretical optimal channel. Numerical results verify the superiority of the proposed SLCPO scheme in PR MU-MISO systems in terms of error rate over state-of-the-art.</description></item><item><title>Parameter Configuration Scheme for Optimal Energy Efficiency in LoRa-Based Wireless Underground Sensor Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891365</link><description>Long Range (LoRa)-based wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs) have attracted much attention due to their long-range communication capability and easiness of deployment. Since it is difficult to replace batteries in buried end nodes, energy efficiency (EE) needs to be improved to extend the lifespan. As link quality is closely related to LoRa physical layer (PHY) parameters and soil characteristics, it is necessary to carefully configure parameters to maintain reliable connectivity and high EE in the dynamic underground environment. To this end, we propose EnergySaver, which utilizes soil moisture to estimate the underground path loss, derives signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to characterize the packet delivery rate (PDR), and finally calculates EE. The combination that maximizes EE is the best configuration for current channel state. In addition, for the case of densely deployed buried LoRa nodes, we propose a low-complexity collision decoding scheme in EnergySaver that utilizes packet time offsets to decompose concurrent transmissions. The simulation results confirm that EnergySaver improves EE by at least two times without sacrificing high link quality, and effectively reduces packet loss during concurrent data transmission with excellent scalability.</description></item><item><title>Full-Duplex Massive MIMO Relaying Over Spatially Correlated Rician Channel With Phase Shifts</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884815</link><description>We analytically study a multi-pair two-way full-duplex (FD) massive multiple-input multiple-output relay system over a spatially correlated Rician channel with unknown phase shifts. Most of the existing literature ignores the line-of-sight (LoS) phase shift, which arises due to user mobility and hardware impairments. We analyze the impact of LoS phase shift on the spectral efficiency (SE) of the system by considering two different channel estimators: i) phase-unaware linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) and ii) phase-aware MMSE. We also formulate the asymptotic SE expressions for three different power scaling schemes considering zero-forcing receiver/zero-forcing transmitter processing at the relay. We numerically show the impact of unknown phase shifts on the SE of the system. Finally, we highlight the impact of i) loop interference due to the FD operation and ii) pilot power on the sum-SE.</description></item><item><title>Security Performance Analysis for MIMO Systems: From Artificial Noise's Power and Dimension Perspective</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884850</link><description>This paper analyzes the influence of power and dimension of artificial noise (AN) on security performance of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with multiple randomly located eavesdroppers. We derive the closed-form expressions of the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and the optimal secrecy capacity by utilizing the irrelevance among transmission channels, and the orthogonality between AN and the basis vectors of the legitimate channel matrix's null space. We use the Poisson point process to determine the number and location of eavesdroppers, then analyze the security performance of the communication system under the 3D channel condition of probability-based line-of-sight (LoS) or non-line-of-sight (NLoS) channel. The simulation results show the following conclusions. When the AN dimension reaches 1/4 highest dimension (i.e., one quarter of the number of transmitting antennae less than one) and the power splitter factor (PSF) falls in the open interval (0.6, 0.9), we can achieve a trade-off between secrecy capacity and design complexity.</description></item><item><title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Aided Covert Communications: A Multi-User Scenario</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10882930</link><description>This article explores a multi-user covert communication scenario with the assistance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Except a covert user monitored by the warden, there are multiple public users existing in the service area. For the purpose of evaluating the efficacy of the covert communication system, a covert constraint is derived measuring the minimum detection error probability of the warden through the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Then an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the convert rate, while ensuring the constraints of covertness, transmit power and quality of service (QoS) for public users. A two-step iterative algorithm jointly designing the active and passive beamforming, is put forth to efficiently resolve this non-convex optimization problem. Additionally, the numerical results clearly demonstrate that the proposed RIS-assisted scheme can significantly enhance the covert communication performance on the premise of guaranteeing the public communication performance of the system.</description></item><item><title>Diagnosis of PV Cell Antireflective Coating Degradation Resulting From Hot-Humid High-Voltage Potential Aging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966198</link><description>Corrosion of the antireflective coating on a photovoltaic cell (&#8220;${\text{AR}}_{\text{c}}$ corrosion&#8221;) has previously been observed in studies using hot-humid test conditions with external high-voltage (HV) bias. This study primarily focuses on known vulnerable legacy aluminum back surface field cells in mini-modules (MiMos) put through comparative stepped stress tests. Each cell type had MiMos at +1500 V, &#8211;1500 V, or unbiased (&#8220;$V_{\text{oc}}$&#8221;) potential, which were sequentially subjected to test conditions of 60 &#176;C/60% relative humidity (RH) for 96 h, as in International Electrotechnical Commission Technical Specification 62804-1; 70 &#176;C/70% RH for 200 h; and 85 &#176;C/85% RH for 200 h. Characterizations at each step included visual camera and electroluminescence (EL) imaging, colorimetry, and current&#8211;voltage curve tracing. Final characterizations included: Suns&#8211;$V_{\text{oc}}$, spatial mapping of external quantum efficiency, high-resolution photoluminescence, EL, and dark lock-in thermography imaging. Forensics were performed on extracted cores, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning Auger microscopy (SAM). Forensics were also conducted on MiMos from previous studies that underwent stepped HV aging and separate outdoor aged full-sized modules. ${\text{AR}}_{\text{c}}$ corrosion was specifically seen for the glass/encapsulant/cell side of the +1500 V (HV+) stressed MiMos and modules. Appearance, color, and reflectance were the most distinguishing characteristics relative to glass corrosion, gridline corrosion and delamination, and other concurrent degradation modes. SEM/EDS and SAM identified the conversion of silicon nitride to hydrated silica, hydrous silica, or hydrated amorphous silica, which preferentially occurred at the edges and tips of the pyramidal textured cell surface.</description></item><item><title>CsGeI3 Perovskite-Based Solar Cells for Higher Efficiency and Stability: An Experimental Investigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988679</link><description>Among the recent developments in photovoltaic technologies, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have drawn significant attention, owing to their exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE), cost-effectiveness, and better optoelectronic characteristics. However, the stability and presence of lead (toxicity) in PSCs remains a major challenge to their commercialization. In this study, we experimentally investigated all-inorganic, lead-free CsGeI3-based PSCs in an n-i-p configuration. The CsGeI3 films were synthesized using a one-step spin-coating technique and their crystallographic characteristics were analyzed. Furthermore, we fabricated and tested different device architectures incorporating CsGeI3 as the absorber layer with various electron transport layers (ETLs), including TiO2, ZnO, and graphene oxide (GO), while employing MoS2 as the hole transport layer. The resulting device structure was Fluorine doped Tin oxide (FTO)/(TiO2/ZnO/GO)/CsGeI3/MoS2/Ni). All fabricated devices demonstrated excellent performance, with the TiO2-based ETL device achieving the highest PCE of 10.79%. In addition, incorporating reduced graphene oxide (rGO) as an interface layer on top of the absorber layer further enhanced photovoltaic performance by approximately 3% across all configurations (achieving outstanding efficiency of 13.57%). The hydrophobic nature and high conductivity of rGO suggest its potential as a promising strategy for improving the stability and efficiency of lead-free PSCs in future applications.</description></item><item><title>Advanced Photovoltaic Module Characterization: Using Image Transformers for Current&#8211;Voltage Curve Prediction From Electroluminescence Images</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002587</link><description>Individual photovoltaic (PV) module health monitoring can be a daunting task for operation and maintenance of solar farms. Modules can be inspected through luminescence, thermal imaging, and current&#8211;voltage (I&#8211;V) curve analyzes for identification of damage and power loss. I&#8211;V curves provide easily interpretable data to determine module health as they directly provide electrical performance metrics. However, in order to obtain these curves, modules must be disconnected from the array and either removed to a solar simulator or characterized in situ with corrections for module temperature, the incident solar spectrum, and intensity. Luminescence or thermal images of a module are relatively easy to acquire in situ. Electroluminescence (EL) images highlight physical defects in the modules but do not provide easily interpretable features to correlate with electrical performance. This work presents a SWin transformer network to predict I&#8211;V curves for PV modules from their corresponding EL images. The predicted I&#8211;V curves allow the accurate prediction of the maximum power point (MPP), short-circuit current $I_{\text {sc}}$, and open-circuit voltage $V_{\text {oc}}$ with a mean error less of than 1%. Comparing single diode model (SDM) parameters extracted from the predicted curves to those extracted from the true curves, the series resistance $R_{\text {s}}$ demonstrates a mean error of 5.19%, and the photocurrent $I$ a mean error of 0.197%. The shunt resistance $R_{\text {sh}}$ and dark current $I_{\text {o}}$ parameters are predicted with larger errors because of their sensitivity to small changes in the I&#8211;V curve.</description></item><item><title>Probability Mass Function of Energy for Light-Collecting Surfaces in Rough Geometries and Its Applications in Urban Energy and Photovoltaics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10971967</link><description>Sunlight throughout urban areas largely impacts local climate [sustainable development goal (SDG) 13], residents&#8217; well-being (SDG 3), and access to clean energy (SDG 7). However, sunlight availability on various urban surfaces is affected by urban geometry. Here, in this work, a probabilistic framework to evaluate the interplay between sunlight and urban geometry is presented, and its immediate applications in urban energy studies are demonstrated. A probability mass function that predicts the energy production of a group of light-collecting surfaces, such as solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, installed in rough geometries, such as urban areas, is derived. Along the way, an expression for the sky view factor (SVF) is formulated within rough geometries as well as a link between the capacity factor of the residential PV fleet and urban geometry. The predictions of the mathematical framework are validated using the digital surface model and collected PV systems data in The Netherlands. This work primarily helps understand the underlying relation between the geometrical parameters of a rough surface and the received sunlight energy on a subset of that surface. Exemplified applications are swift SVF calculations and residential PV fleet yield predictions, which, respectively, support efficient urban energy assessments and privacy-preserving electrical grid management.</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning-Based Health Monitoring for Photovoltaic Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10993290</link><description>The transition to renewable energy sources like photovoltaic (PV) systems is essential for societal progress, counteracting the adverse effects of fossil fuels. However, managing PV systems entails significant challenges and economic implications. PV fault occurrence necessitates swift detection and resolution, exacerbating financial burdens. Effective fault diagnosis relies heavily on data from PV plant monitoring and energy management systems. Historically, PV monitoring relied on manual inspections, but autonomous aerial vehicle (UAV) technology provides a more efficient and comprehensive solution, enhancing safety and offering detailed imagery, scalability, environmental monitoring, and advanced data analytics. This study utilizes deep learning (DL) approaches to monitor the health of the PV, focusing on analyzing UAV-captured scenes. Specifically, this article presents an end-to-end two-stage DL-based health monitoring framework that consists of semantic segmentation model, SegFormer, for isolating solar panels and object detection model, YOLOv8, for identifying anomalies within the PV modules. The proposed framework is validated and compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on a three publicly available UAV-captured datasets. Results show improvements of 25.8% and 1.5% in solar panel segmentation, and 26.6% in solar panel anomaly detection compared with recent SOTA models.</description></item><item><title>Performance Improvements Through Advanced PV Backtracking on Uneven Terrain</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966030</link><description>The climatic sensitivity of new terrain-aware backtracking algorithms is evaluated across 800 locations in the continental USA on a representative synthetic rolling terrain. We find that a global optimization approach to backtracking results in climate-specific annual energy gains of 2.4%&#8211;3.2% relative to a traditional backtracking algorithm baseline. We identify a strong logarithmic correlation between local diffuse fraction and yield improvement, and highlight the effect of seasonal precipitation on performance gains. We also find that a backtracking approach, which approximates the terrain as constant, does not offer significant annual energy gains over the baseline on the synthetic terrain. Our findings suggest that specific yield from backtracking in the USA can be improved by as much as 88 kWh/kW by considering terrain when selecting a backtracking algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Vertical Bifacial Photovoltaic System Model Validation: Study With Field Data, Various Orientations, and Latitudes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10985871</link><description>Accurate modeling of photovoltaic (PV) systems is critical for the design, financial analysis, and monitoring of solar PV plants. For bifacial PV applications, models must additionally offer robust rear-side irradiance algorithms. However, bifacial PV irradiance models have yet to be sufficiently validated for east&#8211;west vertically oriented systems, where direct beam solar irradiation swaps at solar noon. Here, we validate five bifacial irradiance models with field data collected in Golden, CO, USA (40&#176;N) and Fairbanks, AK, USA (65&#176;N) for east&#8211;west vertical, north&#8211;south vertical, and south-tilted arrays. There is no clear best performer among subhourly models; Bifacial_radiance, bifacialVF, the System Advisor Model, and dual-sided energy tracer (DUET) comparably predict seasonal and daily changes in PV production, with root-mean-squared error (RMSE) falling in the range of 11&#8211;28% depending on the location and system orientation. PVSyst (v7.4.8), limited by hourly resolution, demonstrates RMSE in the range of 33&#8211;45%. The primary causes of high RMSE are similar for all models; using an irradiance cutoff of &gt;100 W/m2, using clear-sky filtering, and removing time stamps with snow, lowers model RMSE to 4&#8211;13% for subhourly models and 12&#8211;25% for PVSyst. Regular meteorological station servicing is found to further decrease model RMSE by up to 3% abs. in Alaska. Finally, we model bifacial PV systems in over 250 locations between 15 and 85&#176;N, finding that deviations between model-predicted annual insolation tend to be 2&#8211;3&#215; higher for vertical PV systems than south-facing fixed-tilt systems. We discuss potential methods for improving vertical PV modeling and provide recommendations for high-quality field data collection in northern environments.</description></item><item><title>Sustainability Impact of Different PV Mounting Systems and Pathways for Decarbonizing Emissions of PV Deployment</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11007072</link><description>The amount of electricity generated by a solar panel varies according to the installation location and chosen mounting structure. This changes the effective material consumption and the associated effective carbon emissions of electricity produced by each solar panel. This article investigates the impact of different photovoltaic (PV) mounting systems on energy yield, material consumption, and carbon emissions, focusing on the key configurations of fixed-tilt (FT), east&#8211;west, and single-axis tracking systems. As global PV capacity rapidly expands, understanding the sustainability of these systems is crucial for decarbonizing the electricity sector. We highlight the impact of different mounting systems on yield at different latitudes and demonstrate that the effective material consumption can vary by over 30% in terms of both g/Wp and g/kWh, along with the impact on carbon emissions in terms of both gCO2-eq/Wp and gCO2-eq/kWh. Pathways to reduce the carbon footprint in gCO2-eq/kWh by up to 60% compared with the FT baseline case are also discussed, including incorporating green steel and decarbonized concrete.</description></item><item><title>A Design Methodology for Thermal Monitoring of Reusable Passive Interposers With RTDs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008706</link><description>The heterogeneous integration underpinned by several advanced packaging options, such as passive interposers offers a promising direction for future integrated systems. However, the diversity of chiplets integrated in these systems can increase design complexity. A means to mitigate this situation is to reuse interposer fabrics. Consequently, reusable interposers should provide for signaling, power, and thermal issues. This work emphasizes thermal issues by introducing a novel and sufficiently accurate thermal monitoring strategy suitable for reusable passive interposers. The proposed strategy is based on metal resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) as sensors optimally arranged on a fixed rectangular grid supporting the reuse of passive interposers. A step-by-step methodology provides the design and allocation of the sensors across the interposer fabric under temperature precision and area constraints. Diverse benchmark scenarios are investigated with the proposed RTDs, which consume only  $33.6~\mu \text {W}$  with a footprint of only  $0.159~\text {mm}^{2}$ . Simulation results show that the proposed methodology achieves six times ( $6\times $ ) improvement in mean absolute error (MAE) for reconstructed heatmaps over conventional chiplet-based sensors. This improvement is shown for different chiplet placements onto an interposer and for 2.5-D heterogeneous systems, where the integrated components do not include any or sufficient on-chip thermal sensors to provide the required temperature precision.</description></item><item><title>A 14-bit 6.7 MS/s 0.018 mm2 98 &#956;W SAR A/D Converter With On-the-Fly Autocalibration for Array Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002748</link><description>A 14-bit, 6.7 MS/s successive-approximation-register (SAR) A/D converter (ADC) is presented with on-chip autocalibration. An all-digital calibration algorithm with only two extra half-unit capacitors in capacitive DAC (CDAC) enables the ADC to correct itself from mismatch errors. We introduce digital heavy on-the-fly autocalibration, with novel reuse mechanism of existing capacitors, which deliver analog-precision error-correction yielding superior integral-nonlinearity (INL) and spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) at lowest area. The design is limited by thermal noise and not by mismatch error. A self-shut mechanism in dynamic comparator saves power consumption. A 0.018 mm2 test chip in a 65-nm CMOS process consumes  $98~\mu $ W power. The calibration improves the INL of the ADC from &gt;20 least significant bit (LSB) to &lt;2.9 LSB.

The proposed ADC structure generates two bypass windows through capacitor splitting technique, which can skip unnecessary quantization steps. The judgment module of bypass windows only requires an XOR gate. By introducing redundant capacitors to participate in quantization, the total capacitance value is reduced by half. The proposed SAR ADC is fabricated using a standard 180-nm CMOS process. The measurement results show that it can achieve an effective number of bits (ENOBs) of 9.38 bits and a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 76.71 dB with a supply voltage of 0.6 V at a sampling rate ( $\text{F}_{\mathrm {S}}$ ) of 6.94 kS/s. The power consumption is 15.61 nW when subjected to a 1.17- $\text{V}_{\mathrm {PP}}~3.45$ -kHz sinusoidal input, resulting in a figure of merit (FoM) of 3.38 fJ/conv.-step.

Existing SpMSpM accelerators based on inner product (IP) and outer product (OP) suffer from low computational efficiency and high memory traffic due to inefficient index matching and merging overheads. Gustavson&#8217;s product (GP)-based accelerators mitigate some of these challenges but struggle with workload imbalance and irregular memory access patterns, limiting computational parallelism. To overcome these limitations, we propose a distribute-merge product (DMP), a novel SpMSpM dataflow that evenly distributes workloads across multiple computation streams and merges partial results efficiently. We design and implement DMP-based SpMSpM architecture (DMSA), incorporating four key techniques to fully exploit the parallelism of DMP and efficiently handle irregular memory accesses. Implemented on a Xilinx ZCU106 FPGA, DMSA achieves speedups of up to  $3.38\times $  and  $1.73\times $  over two state-of-the-art FPGA-based SpMSpM accelerators while maintaining comparable hardware resource usage. In addition, compared to CPU and GPU implementations on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, DMSA is  $4.96\times $  and  $1.53\times $  faster while achieving  $6.67\times $  and  $2.33\times $  better energy efficiency, respectively.</description></item><item><title>An 197-&#956;J/Frame Single-Frame Bundle Adjustment Hardware Accelerator for Mobile Visual Odometry</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10973288</link><description>This article presents an energy-efficient hardware accelerator for optimized bundle adjustment (BA) for mobile high-frame-rate visual odometry (VO). BA uses graph optimization techniques to optimize poses and landmarks and the applications are robot navigation, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR). Existing software implementations of BA optimization involve complex computational flows, numerical calculations, Lie group, and Lie algebra conversions.

In this article, we propose the scalable, spiking self-supervised learning, streamline optimization accelerator ( $S^{3}$ A)-neural processing unit (NPU), a highly optimized accelerator for spiking SSL models. This architecture minimizes memory access by leveraging input data provided by the user and optimizes computation through the maximization of data reuse. By dynamically optimizing memory based on model characteristics and implementing specialized operations for data preprocessing, which are critical in SSL, computational efficiency can be significantly improved. The parallel processing lanes account for the two encoders in the SSL architecture, combined with a pipelined structure that considers the temporal data accumulation of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to enhance computational efficiency. We evaluate the design on field-programmable gate array (FPGA), where a 16-bit quantized spiking residual network (ResNet) model trained on the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) and MNIST dataset has top 94.08% accuracy.  $S^{3}$ A-NPU optimization significantly improved computational resource utilization, resulting in a 25% reduction in latency. Moreover, as the first spiking self-supervised accelerator, it demonstrated highly efficient computation compared to existing accelerators, utilizing only 29k look up tables (LUTs) and eight block random access memories (BRAMs). This makes it highly suitable for resource-constrained applications, particularly in the context of spiking SSL models on edge devices. We implemented it on a silicon chip using a 130-nm process design kit (PDK), and the design was less than  $1~\text {cm}^{2}$ .</description></item><item><title>SenHDC: A 3-D NAND Flash-Based Processing-in-Sensor Hyperdimensional Computing Architecture</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10994539</link><description>The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) promotes vision application deployments in embedded devices. To alleviate the data conversion and transmission overheads in CMOS image sensor (CIS), processing-in-sensor (PIS) has been proposed, enabling computations to occur directly within sensory systems. Meanwhile, brain-inspired hyperdimensional computing (HDC) emerges as a promising computing paradigm well-suited for PIS due to its high accuracy and efficiency in various cognitive tasks. However, HDC requires transforming the sensed signals into long hypervectors (HVs), which imposes significant overhead for PIS systems. Thus, in this article, we propose SenHDC, a hardware-software co-design framework for HDC-based PIS. We introduce a novel hardware-friendly encoding paradigm that eliminates complex HV transformations, coupled with a noise-resilient position HV generation method that mitigates the impact of capacitance load imbalance. We further present an efficient 3-D NAND flash-based compute-in-memory (CIM) hardware design, comprising an encoding module that performs encoding in charge domain and an associative search module that checks the similarity between the input and prestored classes for classification. Experimental results show that SenHDC improves energy efficiency by  $40.6\times $  and  $1.6\times $  in the encoding module and associative search module, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art HDC CIM implementations.</description></item><item><title>3-D Digital Compute-in-Memory Benchmark With A5 CFET Technology: An Extension to Lookup-Table-Based Design</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008711</link><description>Digital compute-in-memory (DCIM) has emerged as a promising solution to address scalability and accuracy challenges in analog compute-in-memory (ACIM) for next-generation AI hardware acceleration.

There are already available countermeasure methods currently used for protecting cryptographic implementations that can be tailored to protect embedded NN models. Shuffling, a hiding-based countermeasure that randomly shuffles the order of computations, was shown to be vulnerable to SCA when the Fisher-Yates algorithm is used. In this article, we propose a design of an SCA-secure version of the Fisher-Yates algorithm. By integrating the masking technique for modular reduction and Blakely&#8217;s method for modular multiplication, we effectively remove the vulnerability in the division operation that led to side-channel leakage in the original version of the algorithm. We experimentally evaluate that the countermeasure is effective against SCA by implementing a correlation power analysis (CPA) attack on an embedded NN model implemented on ARM Cortex-M4. Compared to the original proposal, the memory overhead is  $2\times $  the biggest layer of the network, while the time overhead varies from 4% to 0.49% for a layer with 100 and 1000 neurons, respectively.</description></item><item><title>RVSLH: Acceleration of Postquantum Standard SLH-DSA With Customized RISC-V Processor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10915711</link><description>Postquantum cryptography (PQC) has developed quickly in response to the rise of quantum computers.

Such artifact usually becomes more severe when the matrix ultrasound transducer is closely integrated with pitch-matched application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), where interference from electrical power supplies dominates the correlated noise. To tackle this problem, this article presents a PSRR-enhanced nine-channel ultrasound low-noise-amplifier (LNA) array that employs a shared low-dropout regulator (LDO) to compress the impact of the correlated noise from power supply. This work utilizes inverter-based LNA with split-capacitor and dynamic biasing techniques to achieve small area ( $110\times52.7~\mu $ m), low input referred noise (5.34 nV/ $\sqrt {\mathbf {Hz}} $ ) and low power consumption ( $50~\mu $ A) simultaneously. To enhance the power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) performance while maintaining high area- and power-efficiency, the LNA array incorporates a compact ( $50\times70~\mu $ m) local regulator based on a flipped-voltage-follower (FVF) with dynamically biased current-mode feed-forward ripple cancellation (FFRC). Fabricated in a 0.18  $\mu $ m BCD process, the proposed LNA array, including bias and local regulator, occupies only 0.0068 mm2 per channel and consumes an average power of 0.134 mW. Each LNA achieves a PSRR of 65.9 dB at 5 MHz, which is 20 dB better than the state of the art.</description></item><item><title>A 112-Gb/s PAM-4 Retimer Transceiver With Jitter-Filtering Clocking Scheme and BER Optimization Technique in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10955714</link><description>This article presents a 112-Gb/s four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) analog-to-digital converter (ADC)-digital signal processing (DSP)-based retimer transceiver for reaching-distance extension. An injection-locked oscillator (ILO)-based jitter-filtering clocking scheme with relaxed bandwidth limitation and low-power consumption is proposed to obtain synchronous low-jitter clocks. The transmitter (TX) utilizes an internal feed-forward equalizer (FFE) cascaded with a forward-coupling pad driver to improve the output inter-symbol interference (ISI) jitter, and a timing-optimized 4:1 multiplexer (MUX) to reduce the serialization jitter. The receiver (RX) combines a flexible continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE), a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-optimized ADC with 8-bit quantization, and a high-resolution digital equalization to further minimize the bit-error rate (BER). Fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, the prototype transceiver achieves 1E-12 raw BER at 112 Gb/s while compensating 31.2-dB channel loss. The clock network delivers a rms recovered clock jitter of 252 fs and a power efficiency of 0.56 pJ/bit, which outperforms other state-of-the-art works.</description></item><item><title>A 376-&#956;W per-Channel, Drift-Tolerant Translocation Recording Frontend With Event Detection for Nanopore Sensor Arrays</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016736</link><description>The molecular sensing of protein and DNA molecules with nanopore sensor arrays necessitates high-speed readout interfaces. This leads to high output data rates, while only a very small portion of the recorded data contains useful translocation data. The high data rate creates a bottleneck for the design of high-density arrays of nanopores. This article addresses the issue by proposing an event-based recording approach. In this approach, the transmembrane current is monitored in all nanopores, and it is recorded only from the nanopores, in which a translocation event is detected. A prototype is presented, in which the proposed translocation event recording approach is implemented for a 16-nanopore array along with a resistive feedback transimpedance amplifier (TIA) and an successive approximation reduction (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The TIA achieves 0.646-nArms noise performance and a 0.92-MHz bandwidth with the electrical model of a typical solid-state nanopore. The SAR ADC samples the TIA output at 2 MS/s and achieves 9.1 ENOB. The experiments to test the event detection approach with solid-state nanopores and barcoded DNA are also presented with the results.</description></item><item><title>A 0.00175 mm2 and 9.62 &#956;W per Channel Direct-Digitization Front End With EDO Compensation for Neural Probes With a Spatial Resolution of 35 &#956;m</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10960609</link><description>This article presents a recording front end tailored to modular CMOS neural probes with high spatial resolution and integrated on-site digitization. The architecture leverages a folded-cascode operational transconductance amplifier (OTA)-C two-step delta-sigma ( $\Delta \Sigma $ ) converter with a four-channel time multiplexing to enable efficient signal processing.

The well-known issue of  $\Delta \!\Sigma $  quantization error in fractional-N operation is compensated by a capacitive digital-to-analog converter (CDAC), which serves the conventional role of a digital-to-time converter (DTC). This CDAC is further merged with the inherent CDAC of a successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which is exclusively used for digitizing the time-error mainly induced by the phase noise (PN). Initially, the combined CDACs are preset to  $V_{\text {DD}}$ , and then discharged during a short digitally controlled oscillator (DCO)-divider-triggered pulse via a pseudo-differential MOS pair directly driven by the input reference sinusoidal waveform. Owing to the gentle slope of the reference waveform, the charge-domain fractional-N operation achieves a wide and linear time-error detection (TD) range. Furthermore, by reinterpreting the SAR ADC output using multi-bit midrise encoding, the effective time-to-digital conversion (TDC) gain is boosted by bang-bang (BB) effects while maintaining fast and robust locking. To accurately model the CSS current, we introduce a damped-sine waveform model incorporating harmonics, providing comprehensive insight into the CSS-TD gain, even with short-channel devices. Fabricated in 22nm CMOS, the prototype achieves an rms jitter of 96fs at 24GHz with a reference spur of &#8722;60dBc in integer-N mode, while 167.8fs at approximately 24.5GHz with a worst in-band spur of &#8722;47.8dBc in fractional-N mode. The occupied area is only 0.08mm2.</description></item><item><title>A 92.3%-Efficiency Switching-Mode Dual-Output Regulating Rectifier With Improved Link Adaptability for Wireless Power Transfer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908624</link><description>This article presents a 6.78-MHz switching-mode wireless power transfer (WPT) receiver (RX) with single-stage dual-output regulation and improved adaptability to link variations for biomedical applications. Based on a modified voltage doubler topology, it optimally transitions between voltage mode (VM) and resonant current mode (RCM) to extend the WPT range without compromising efficiency or delivered power. Seamless mode transition is achieved with no dead zones or output undershoots, thanks to the proposed quasi-open-circuit mode detection leveraging existing operational states without power-carrier interferences. The essential advantages of switching mode are consolidated via transient modeling. To meet dual-voltage-domain supply requirement in bio-implants, the RX uses stacked dc nodes in the voltage doubler to generate two regulated outputs with only three power switches. Designed and fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS technology, the proposed RX regulates two dc outputs at 1.8 and 3.3 V, respectively, with unobservable load-transient over/undershoots and cross-regulations. Using a 3.3-V-supplied class-D transmitter (TX), a 13.5-mm-radius TX coil, and an 11.5-mm-radius RX coil, the RX achieves a maximum WPT range of 7.5 cm under both 50-k $\Omega $  load conditions, demonstrating a 42% extension compared with VM-only operation. Real-time mode transition is validated through coil separation distance transients between 3 and 5.5 cm. In addition, with adaptive delay compensation in both VM and RCM operations, the RX achieves a peak power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 92.3% at a maximum output power of 171 mW.</description></item><item><title>A Wideband Sub-6-GHz Transceiver Front End for 5G Base Stations in 22-nm FD-SOI CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10946666</link><description>A fully integrated, non-frequency-translating, low-impedance transceiver (TRX) front end for cellular base stations (BSs) covering 1.25&#8211;5.5 GHz is presented. The transmitter (TX) features two variable gain feedback pre-power amplifier (PPA) stages, a power amplifier (PA), and an RF notch filter based on frequency translation for suppressing spurious signals. The receiver (RX) features a low noise amplifier (LNA), a variable gain amplifier (VGA), and an equalizer supporting three concurrent frequency bands with orthogonal frequency and gain tuning. The PA and LNA use a 12.5- $\Omega $  differential impedance, primarily to boost PA output power and bandwidth (BW). Special emphasis is put on the thermal analysis of the PA and the techniques to improve the cooling. When operating with full PA supply (7.4 V), including antenna-switch and package losses, the TX reaches a record saturated output power ( $P_{\mathrm {sat}}$ ) of 38.1 dBm at 3.4 GHz, and for a 100-MHz 16-QAM orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signal at 2.7 GHz, the TX delivers an output power of 32.6 dBm with an error vector magnitude (EVM) of -17.6 dB, with a complete TX efficiency of 13.5%. With a reduced PA supply of 3.8 V, an  ${8} {\times } {100}$  MHz 256-QAM OFDM signal with 21.6 dBm was measured with EVM  ${\lt } {-}31.1$  dB. The TX filter achieves about 40-dB notch depth at 1&#8211;6-GHz notch frequencies, and the 20- and 30-dB rejection BW can be controlled from 1 to 10 MHz and from 0.4 to 4 MHz, respectively. The front end has an RX noise figure (NF) of 1.3&#8211;2 dB, while the third-order intercept point (IIP3) is above -12.4 dBm, at maximum gain (29 dB) over the frequency range of 1.55&#8211;4.8 GHz. The passive equalizer improves the RX interference handling and is analyzed using closed-form expressions. The active part of the die, manufactured in 22-nm fully depleted silicon on insulator (FD-SOI) CMOS technology, occupies 6.6 mm2.</description></item><item><title>Fully Integrated Optical Injection Locking With Schottky Photodiodes in 65-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10979703</link><description>This article presents an optical injection-locked oscillator implemented in a standard 65-nm CMOS process with integrated Schottky photodiodes (PDs).

The P-substrate diode demonstrated superior performance, reducing the free-running rms jitter from 38.7 to 1.02 ps at 1310 nm with 3.5-mW optical power or to 2.51 ps at 1550 nm with 1.0-mW optical power. Across three samples, the oscillator exhibited a tuning range from 2.9 to 3.3 GHz, with a maximum variance of 37 MHz and a power consumption of 4.41 mW. These findings underscore the potential of fully integrated optical systems in standard CMOS to enhance long-distance communication networks.</description></item><item><title>A Digital-Sampling PLL With a Second-Order Noise Shaping SAR ADC Phase Detector</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10936991</link><description>An integer-N digital-sampling phase-locked loop (PLL) based on a noise-shaping SAR (NS-SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) breaks the quantization noise limitation of prior ADC-based phase detectors and enables the use of a lower resolution ADC quantizer and capacitive digital to analog converter (CDAC). Additionally, this improved ADC resolution reduces the phase-detector gain requirement and improves the lock performance. The 2nd-order noise-shaping of the NS-SAR ADC improves the time-to-voltage resolution of the phase detector by reducing in-band quantization noise and ADC input-referred noise (e.g., comparator noise). Measurements verify that noise shaping reduces the in-band noise by about 7 dB. The 28 nm CMOS prototype PLL operates at 4.3 GHz and consumes 13.7 mW. The measured rms integrated jitter from 1 kHz to 100 MHz is 133 fs.</description></item><item><title>Enabling Energy-Efficient Homomorphic Encryption Evaluation via eDRAM-Based In-Situ Computing in an Edge Processor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11008911</link><description>This work demonstrates an edge processor featuring programmable and energy-efficient homomorphic encryption (HE) evaluation using in-situ computing (ISC) and in-memory computing (IMC) techniques. HE has been a promising candidate for privacy-preserving computing; however, it is challenged by extreme computation and storage inflation. This has motivated pioneering works on HE hardware in domain-specific accelerator (DSA) forms, whose nature of von Neumann architecture limits their further gains with high-dimensional intermediate ciphertext. The demonstrated processor architecture enables HE evaluation on the edge, addressing intermediate ciphertext&#8217;s heavy buffering and swapping overheads. The in-situ HE processing core (ISHEPC) employs tightly coupled dynamic logic and eDRAM bit cells to enable highly dense local storage and parallel programmable computing. An automorphism network implemented at both circuit and architecture levels connects bit cells across ISHEPCs, harnessing chip-level gains with efficient HE data swapping. A silicon prototype integrating eight ISHEPCs with a RISC-V CPU demonstrated in 28-nm CMOS achieves a peak energy efficiency of 3.04 M-NTT/J, a peak throughput of 13.9 k-NTT/s, both with 4096-D 19 bit at 0.8 V, and a local storage density of 2.33 Mb/mm2. This enables 620-k-Op/J CKKS encryption with the same data and voltage configurations. The system demonstration of support-vector-machine (SVM) inference using the CKKS-residue number system (RNS) HE scheme on the LFW dataset achieves 85.5% accuracy with a peak throughput of 2.2 Op/s and a peak energy efficiency of 500 Op/J at 0.8 V.</description></item><item><title>RXO-LDPC: A Physics-Inspired Relaxation Oscillator-Based Solver Leveraging Six-Body Spin Interactions for Soft Decoding of LDPC Codes</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11052258</link><description>Physics-inspired computing harnesses continuous-time (CT) operation, massive parallelism, and direct compute load mapping to coupled CMOS-based spins to accelerate solving complex optimization problems. This work advances the field by introducing relaxation oscillator (RXO)-low-density parity check (LDPC), a combinatorial optimization problem (COP) engine that natively supports six-body spin interactions for efficient, robust, and one-shot oscillator-based soft decoding of LDPC codes. The proposed RXO spins feature a capacitor-DAC-based initialization structure, allowing precise mapping of soft information to initial spin phases for high-performance decoding. A crossbar-based feedback system facilitates six-body spin interactions by directly coupling spins based on the COP graph. Implemented in 28-nm CMOS technology, the prototype achieves a frame error rate (FER) and bit error rate (BER) of  $1.36{\times }10{^{-6}}$  and  $1.89{\times }10{^{-7}}$ , respectively, at 7-dB SNR. The measured BER is more than three orders of magnitude lower than for belief propagation (BP) decoding, for channels with 2&#8211;5-dB SNR. The measured energy efficiency of 7.28 pJ/bit exceeds the normalized efficiencies of state-of-the-art decoders. Evaluated with more than 100 million decoding cycles, the system demonstrates reliable performance across a wide range of SNRs, supply voltages, temperatures, and for different dies. These measurement results highlight the RXO-based architecture&#8217;s potential as an accelerator for directly solving COPs with multi-body spin interactions.</description></item><item><title>HUNBN, a 16-nm Digital In-Memory-Compute SoC for Edge CNN Application Achieving 24 TOPs/W (4b) at System Level</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10966027</link><description>This work presents HUNBN, a fully digital in-memory-compute (DIMC) system-on-chip (SoC) implemented using 16-nm FinFET CMOS technology.

Among the methods employed for inference in these models, sampling-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are widely used. However, MCMC methods come with significant computational costs and are inherently challenging to parallelize, resulting in inefficient execution on conventional CPU/GPU platforms. To overcome these challenges, this article presents an approximate inference accelerator (AIA), a multi-core RISC-V system-on-chip (SoC) design fabricated using Intel&#8217;s 16 nm process technology. Our AIA is specifically designed to empower edge devices with robust decision-making and reasoning abilities. The AIA architecture incorporates an RISC-V host processor to manage chip-to-chip data communication and a 2-D mesh of 16 custom versatile RISC-V cores optimized for high-efficiency approximate inference. Each core features: 1) custom instructions and datapath blocks for non-normalized Knuth-Yao (KY) sampling, as well as for the interpolation of non-linear functions (e.g., logarithmic and exponential), and 2) direct data-access to the register file (RF) of each neighboring core, to reduce the data movement costs of frequent data exchanges between nearby cores. To further capitalize on the parallelism potential in MCMC algorithms, we developed a specialized compile chain that enables efficient spatial mapping and scheduling across the cores. As a result, AIA attains a peak sampling rate of 1277 MSamples/s at 0.9 V and achieves an energy efficiency of 20 GSamples/s/W at 0.7 V, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art (SotA) ASIC accelerator for probabilistic inference by up to  $6\times $  in speed and  $5\times $  in energy efficiency. Furthermore, the AIA&#8217;s versatility is demonstrated through the successful mapping of different types of PM workloads onto the chip.</description></item><item><title>An Inductive Loading Simultaneous Noise and Input Matching Technique With Current Reuse for Low-Power LNA</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787398</link><description>This article presents an inductive loading simultaneous noise and input matching (ILSNIM) technique for a low-power low-noise amplifier (LNA). In contrast to conventional simultaneous noise and input matching (SNIM) methods, where lossy resistance associated with an on-chip low-Q gate inductor substantially degrades the total noise figure (NF) performance, the input stage of the proposed LNA exploits the gate-drain capacitance feedback incorporated with inductive loading for the first time to construct the input impedance network. This design approach overcomes the NF limitation in conventional SNIM techniques by eliminating the lossy gate inductor while boosting the transconductance to achieve SNIM under low power consumption. Furthermore, a current-reuse structure with a cascaded stage is applied not only to enhance the overall gain but also to generate a noiseless resistive component that addresses the instability issue without adverse impacts on other performances. Fabricated using a 0.11- $\mu $ m complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process, the proposed ILSNIM LNA demonstrates a gain of 13.6 dB, an NF of 2.8 dB, and a third-order input intercept point (IIP3) of -5.2 dBm at 6.8 GHz under a 1.2-mW power dissipation from a 1-V supply.</description></item><item><title>A 22.8&#8211;26.0-GHz VCO With Discriminative-Harmonic-Current-Manipulating for Phase Noise Improvement</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10756796</link><description>A discriminative-harmonic-current-manipulating (DHCM) technique is proposed to improve the phase noise (PN) of high-frequency voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs). Superior PN performance has been demonstrated by conventional multi-resonance VCOs when they are equipped with appropriately tailored tank impedance. However, meticulous alignment of the impedance peaks is typically required through manual tuning, particularly at high frequencies. In this work, the 3rd harmonic voltage, crucial for reshaping the impulse sensitivity function (ISF), is sustained by substantially boosting the 3rd harmonic current. Meanwhile, the 2nd harmonic current, identified as causing high ISF sensitivity and consequent noticeable PN fluctuations, is drastically suppressed. By selectively manipulating these harmonic currents, the rigorous requirement on the concurrent multiple impedance peaks is alleviated, thereby enabling a tuning-free multi-resonance oscillation. The DHCM VCO prototyped in a 65-nm CMOS process measures a tuning range of 22.8&#8211;26 GHz and PN of &#8722;134.6 dBc/Hz at 10-MHz offset, while consuming dc power of 7.3&#8211;9.7 mW from a 0.6-V supply.

This design addresses the challenges commonly encountered in conventional high-power oscillators. These challenges include a low inductor quality factor (Q) associated with the use of large active devices and the need for extensive chip area when combining multiple optimally designed cells. Based on a  $\Pi $ -embedded oscillator architecture, we show that with N-stacked FET, the optimal embedding inductor and load resistance increase approximately with N. This contrasts with the traditional size scaling approach, where L and R decrease unfavorably as the device size increases. We take advantage of this characteristic by proposing a design methodology that simultaneously achieves high output power and optimal inductor Q. The concept is validated by a design example of a two-stack  $\Pi $ -embedded oscillator. Fabricated using the 45-nm CMOS SOI process to eliminate body effects and minimize substrate loss, two losslessly combined oscillator cores deliver a total RF power of 11 dBm at 180 GHz. Without the use of varactors, this design achieves the highest output power among CMOS oscillators at this frequency, making it suitable for narrowband applications.</description></item><item><title>Design and Implementation of a D-Band Bidirectional Common-Gate Amplifier in 45-nm RFSOI</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10781311</link><description>This article presents a new design methodology for a D-band bidirectional amplifier that leverages the inherent symmetry of CMOS transistors in a common-gate amplifier.

Precise timing delay is obtained simply by adjusting the dc offset of the sine signal. A low-complexity sinusoidal-like predistortion linearizes its transfer function. The technique merges the functionality of a digital-to-time converter (DTC) with an XO generation, thus drastically reducing the power consumption of the targeted subsystem while offering a wide range with fine resolution, low noise, and high linearity. Without the requirement for a power-hungry reference buffer/slicer, the proposed DTC benefits from the raw XO waveform, resulting in a large delay coverage and fine resolution. Fabricated in 22-nm fully depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) CMOS, the prototype of XO+DTC consumes only 0.52mW while achieving a 546-ps range with a fine resolution of 266 fs. Its rms jitter (integrated from 1 kHz to 10 MHz) is only 86.6 fs at the output frequency of 100 MHz. Using predistortion of only the fundamental harmonic of a prestored sinusoidal lookup table (LUT), the measured integral nonlinearity (INL) is reduced to +2/&#8722;1.9 ps. Together with a higher-harmonic content, such as the second to fourth harmonics, the peak-to-peak INL and DNL is brought down to within &#177;1 LSB (i.e., 266 fs).

A voltage-to-time converter (VTC) driving a current-integrating capacitor array through a time pulse facilitates the inter-stage residue amplification, which decouples the constraint between linearity and speed of the residue generation. The time residue path shortens the residue generation period with a lower linearity requirement and quantizes 4 bits simultaneously, speeding up the sub-stage ADC conversion; the voltage residue path achieves a dedicated inter-stage gain with high linearity and relaxed timing, suppressing noise of its subsequent stages. Furthermore, the inherent complementation characteristic of the voltage-time&#8211;voltage (V-T&#8211;V) conversion in the TARG scheme makes the prototype ADC intrinsically robust to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations. Fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, the 2.6-GS/s pipelined ADC achieves a 51.4-dB signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) and a 71.0-dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) with a Nyquist input at a 0.9-V power supply, exhibiting a Walden figure-of-merit of 17.6 fJ/conversion-step. The SNDR varies by 1.25 and 1.55 dB across a supply variation of &#177;5% and a temperature range of  ${-} 40~{^{\circ }}$ C to  $85~{^{\circ }}$ C, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A 2.72-fJ/Conversion-Step 13-bit SAR ADC With Wide Common-Mode Complementary Split Pre-Amplifier Comparator and Grounded-Finger CDAC</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10792657</link><description>This article presents a compact 13-bit 2-MS/s successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) designed to enhance energy efficiency under various comparator input common-mode voltage scenarios. The proposed comparator structure features a complementary split pre-amplifier to extend the input common-mode range, resulting in an SNDR drop of approximately 1 dB even at a near 0-V ADC input common-mode voltage of 0.038 V. Furthermore, the proposed grounded-finger capacitive digital-to-analog converter (CDAC) reduces the impact of hard-to-scale fringe capacitance with a regular structure in order to reduce the number of CDAC elements and area. Utilizing these techniques, the prototype SAR ADC implemented in a 65-nm CMOS LP process achieves an uncalibrated integral non-linearity (INL) of 1.07 LSB, an 87.4% reduction in elements, and 70.6-dB SNDR in a 0.0372 mm2, consuming only  $15.1~{\mu }$  W at 0.75 V that results in a Walden figure of merit (FoMW) of 2.72 fJ/conversion-step.</description></item><item><title>A 119-dBA Dynamic Range, 3.3-mW Audio CTDSM With a Class-B Resistor DAC and Continuous-Time Quantizer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772709</link><description>Applications requiring far-field voice/audio recording have increased the need for low-power, high dynamic range (DR) audio analog to digital converter (ADC). In these applications, the DR specification determines the maximum distance at which a low-cost microphone can obtain a good quality recording. The continuous-time delta&#8211;sigma modulator (CTDSM) architecture is typically chosen for audio applications due to its inherent antialiasing property and resistive input.

In the first-stage SAR ADC, we propose using the continuous-time SAR (CTSAR) as the coarse SAR ADC in the detect-and-skip (DAS) scheme, thus parallelizing MSB conversion with ADC sampling. Furthermore, in the residue amplifier (RA), an OCCLS technique is proposed, which significantly speeds up the first correlated level shifting (CLS) phase by open-loop amplification and consequently enhances the equivalent open-loop gain at negligible extra time cost. An on-chip background self-detect-and-cut loop is used for the OCCLS to attain a PVT-robust high equivalent open-loop gain. For RA implementation, a hybrid static-floating ring-amp structure is adopted to improve the noise performance while fitting in well with the OCCLS scheme. Thanks to the proposed techniques, the 22-nm prototype achieves 70.7-dB SNDR under 200 MS/s while consuming only 2.0 mW from a 0.9-V supply. It measures 177.7-dB FoMs, which is the highest among ADCs with equivalent or higher sampling rates.</description></item><item><title>A 0.7 cm2, 3.5 GHz, &#8722;31 dBm Sensitivity Battery-Free 5G Energy-Harvester Backscatterer With 20 s Cold-Start Wake-Up Time for IoT-Enabled Warehouses</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10766435</link><description>The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) demand ultralow power wireless systems.

The stimulator employs an activate-on-demand asynchronous strategy, instructing the boost converter to generate the dynamically increased high voltage that tracks the electrode&#8217;s voltage drop, thus achieving a near-adiabatic stimulation. The strategy relies on measuring the boost&#8217;s varying voltage conversion ratio (VCR), which is facilitated by an 8-bit voltage ratio quantizer (VRQ) proposed in this article. Furthermore, the boost converter employs a low-power, fast-speed, HV gate driver (HVGD) to control its p-type power switch that connects the inductor to the HV output. This article also presents a dedicated digital circuit that generates the pulse signals for controlling the n-type power switch and the HVGD. This digital circuit is driven by a five-phase clock from a current-starved ring oscillator. A highly efficient rotationally symmetric level shifter is utilized for the ring oscillator&#8217;s output, translating its level and improving its rise/fall time. The boost converter reaches a peak efficiency of 90.2%, enabling the stimulator to achieve an end-to-end energy efficiency of up to 86% during a biphasic stimulation of 6 mA.

Ordered reliability bits GRAND (ORBGRAND) is a soft-detection variant of GRAND that uses soft information to guide its query order to significantly improve the decoding performance. This work presents the first-integrated energy-efficient hardware implementation of ORBGRAND to achieve ultra-low energy (sub-pJ/bit) and power consumption (5 mW) while using a small core area of 0.4 mm2 in 40-nm CMOS.

To address this issue, we propose an asynchronous spiking and backpropagation hybrid neural network olfactory processor, asynchronous neuromorphic processor-gas recognition (ANP-G), which is the first gas recognition processor enabling on-chip class-incremental learning with few shot and concentration estimation. Its key features include: 1) a bio-inspired spiking neural network (SNN), approximation to the mammalian olfactory system that enables rapid retraining over nine types of gas with no accuracy loss to overcome the disturbance caused by sensor drift; 2) spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with lateral inhibition supporting few shot that achieves over 95% accuracy with less than five training samples per gas; and 3) asynchronous SNN circuits with a self-skipping epoch learning (SSEL) mechanism to skip unnecessary weight update reducing over 84% training costs.

However, its hard quantization nonlinearity makes it nontrivial to estimate its linearized gain and the power of the quantization error (QE) that it introduces, and hence can make the linearized analysis at the DPLL-system level inaccurate. This tutorial paper formulates a minimum-mean-square-error estimator that is used to provide an accurate linearized analysis of the TDC; it takes into account the interaction between the quantization characteristic of the TDC and the statistical properties of the input jitter of a frequency synthesizer in both integer-N and fractional-N modes. A strategy for minimizing the TDC&#8217;s QE is provided; so-designed TDCs with equidistant quantization thresholds are able to achieve optimum jitter minimization at both the TDC and DPLL levels. Finally, the effective linear operating region of such TDCs is derived, which explains when the &#8220;hard quantizer&#8221; can be regarded as an almost linear PD and when not. Behavioral simulations at the TDC-block and DPLL-system levels underpin our analysis.</description></item><item><title>Spurs in Fractional-N Frequency Synthesizers Resulting From Resolution Mismatch Between the Divider Controller and the DTC: Manifestations, Analysis, and Mitigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10964399</link><description>The digital-to-time converter (DTC) used in fractional-N phase locked loops is designed to cancel the accumulated quantization error (QE) arising from the divider controller. In high-resolution synthesizers, the DTC performs an additional quantization when mapping the required high-resolution phase correction to its coarse-resolution output. This inherent hard quantization nonlinearity of the DTC, which is different from the DTC&#8217;s well-known soft integral nonlinearity, causes yet another kind of inexact cancellation of the QE and induces excess spurious tones that degrade the output phase noise and jitter. This paper reveals the root cause of the &#8220;DTC&#8217;s QE&#8221; and spectral manifestation of the DTC-quantization-induced (DQI) spurs. The waveform of the DTC&#8217;s QE is derived analytically; it shows that the DQI-spur pattern is (i) determined by the fractional frequency control word and the quantization resolution of the DTC, and (ii) is independent of the type, order, and modulus of the divider controller. In view of the fact that conventional DTC linearity enhancement techniques and stochastic divider controllers have no effect on DQI-spur mitigation, we propose a novel family of DTC-enhancement methods called input-dithered quantization (IDQ). When used in DTCs, the IDQ methods are effective in eliminating DQI spurs at source with negligible phase noise or jitter penalty.</description></item><item><title>A 48-dB Range, 0.86-dB Step, and 0.06-dB Error dB-Linear PGA Based on Resistive Ladder Attenuator: Design Theory and Realization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10765147</link><description>This paper presents the effective design theory and realization for a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) with extremely small gain error and high-resolution decibel (dB)-linear characteristic in a 48 dB gain control range. Based on the resistive ladder attenuator topology and the complementary binary-weighted switching technique, the gain error in digitally controlled dB-linear characteristic is significantly reduced by introducing an optimization factor in the pseudo-exponential function fitting. To achieve both extremely small gain error and a relatively wide gain range, an optimization method for trading off different types of gain error is employed to obtain the optimal optimization factor. An adaptive bias circuit is adopted to realize gain robustness to process and temperature variations.The proposed PGA is fabricated in a  $0.18~\mu $ m CMOS technology with a 0.063 mm2 core area.

This leads to sensing failure due to the offset and long sensing time of the BLSA. To address this issue, various offset compensation methods and technologies that reduce sensing time have been proposed. However, these technologies still exhibit sensing failure due to long sensing times in low-power and large-capacity memory with low supply voltage and high  $C_{BLT}/C_{Cell}$  ratio. In addition, previous BLSAs require additional offset compensation time, which further increases the sensing time. A hidden-offset cancellation time and cross-coupled pre-sensing capacitor-coupled offset-canceled sense amplifier (HCP_COSA) are proposed to address these problems. To reduce the sensing time, the separate offset cancellation (OC) cycle is eliminated by performing OC for the cross-coupled inverter and charge-sharing simultaneously. In addition, the cross-coupled inverter operation is used in the pre-sensing phase to further amplify the reference bit line (BLB) voltage with the opposite polarity of the read-out signal, thereby improving both sensing margin and time. The proposed HCP_COSA achieves up to 18.5% faster sensing time at a supply voltage of 0.9 V by increasing the difference between the bit line (BLT) and the BLB by 2.55-3.76 times before starting the main sensing (MS) phase, compared with the previous works. In addition, the proposed architecture increases the number of word lines that can be sensed by up to 33.3% and achieves a sensing yield of 100% even at a low supply voltage of 0.65 V.</description></item><item><title>A 362-TOPS/W Mixed-Signal MAC Macro With Sampling-Weight-Nonlinearity Cancellation and Dynamic-Amplified Accumulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829503</link><description>This work presents a high energy-efficiency mixed-signal multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) macro in charge-domain for machine learning (ML) systems.

True VCO-ADC architectures have been proposed to increase the noise-shaping order by cascading several VCO integrators, but without requiring analog feedback loops. A high noise-shaping order allows to reduce the input VCO frequency compared to a conventional VCO-ADC with similar dynamic range, which improves power consumption. Prior-art True VCO-ADC architectures represent state variables either with a unity-weighted code or with a single-bit. Unity-weighted encoding is a natural choice when ring oscillators are selected as loop filter integrators. However, chip area restrictions force unity-weighted state variables to have few levels. A reduced number of levels in the state variables limits the dynamic range of True VCO-ADCs. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate a second-order audio VCO-based ADC that uses ring oscillators as integrators but employs Gray and binary encoded state variables. As a consequence, the complexity and area of the True VCO-ADC architecture is reduced, breaking the barrier that limits the dynamic range of prior designs. The proof-of-concept chip shows a dynamic range of 103 dB achieving a peak SNDR of 76.5 dB-A with a power of  $250~\mu $ W occupying  $0.095~\text {mm}^{2}$  in 130 nm CMOS.</description></item><item><title>An 11-bit 360-MS/s Pipelined SAR ADC With Feedback Factor Compensation Using a Dynamic Negative-C-Assisted Residue Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758675</link><description>This paper presents an energy-efficient residue amplification for low-power high-speed pipelined SAR ADC, whose residue amplifier is assisted by a dynamic negative capacitance (NC) circuit at the virtual ground. This dynamic NC for the residue amplifier increases the feedback factor while maintaining the closed-loop signal gain, thereby relaxing the requirements of the residue amplifier such as unity-gain bandwidth and open-loop gain, which subsequently leads to a power reduction of the residue amplifier. The proposed dynamic NC addresses the issues associated with static counterparts while maintaining small gain error, increased effective bandwidth, and high energy efficiency. Fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, the prototype 11-bit pipelined SAR ADC achieves a signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) of 58 dB and a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 77.9 dB with Nyquist input at a sampling rate of 360-MS/s, while consuming only 3.9 mW from a 0.95 V supply.

To address this issue, we derive the noise transfer function of the loop&#8217;s equivalent current under  $\Sigma \Delta $  modulation by modeling the phase-locked loop based on linear system theory. Since the input signal is a random sequence that cannot be directly applied to a linear model analysis, this paper introduces a new mathematical model that functionalizes the input sequence. This functionalized random variable retains its original probability distribution and power spectrum, while providing a functional expression that can be integrated directly into the system&#8217;s transfer function for calculation. Furthermore, the model incorporates the input frequency information, which aids in analyzing the effects of nonlinearity. Using this functionalization method, we conduct a detailed analysis of the quantization noise folding phenomenon and derive exact equations for the noise floor and noise corner frequency under charge pump mismatch. Additionally, we present the complete power spectral density of the output noise under nonlinear effects. To validate the proposed model, a behavioral-level simulation is performed using MATLAB, with results showing strong agreement between the simulation and theoretical predictions, demonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Analyses Concerning the Phase Noise and Nonlinear Behavior of the Charge-Sharing Integrator-Based Hybrid PLL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10790864</link><description>Hybrid PLLs (HPLLs) leverage the advantages of conventional analog and digital PLLs to cater to the high integration demand inherent with the advanced CMOS nodes, among which the charge-sharing (CS) integrator-based HPLL featuring ultra-compact area and ultra-low power consumption exhibits promising prospects.

The proposed models offer precise PN PSD estimations over the specified frequency range under all simulated conditions, whose integrated jitters differ by less than 5 fs compared with circuit simulations. The additional nonlinearity induced by the CS integrator is also considered, and an analytical prediction approach for the nonlinearity-induced spurs is presented, showing a capability of predicting the locations and amplitudes of the most significant spurious tones with a less than 4 % deviation in the relative offset frequency and a less than 5 dBc deviation in the relative amplitude.</description></item><item><title>A 13.2-kSPS Data Rate, 5.1-G &#937; Input Impedance Read-Out IC for DC Measurements</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819994</link><description>A high input impedance read-out integrated circuit (IC) for DC measurements has been implemented. The proposed read-out IC consists of a capacitively coupled instrumentation amplifier (CCIA) and an incremental delta-sigma ( $\Delta \Sigma $ ) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). An impedance boosting technique, combining the conventional positive-feedback loop with a proposed fine current compensation loop (FCCL), is introduced to enhance the input impedance of the CCIA. Additionally, the proposed structure chops the entire signal chain at a global chopping frequency of 13.2 kHz, which is higher than the 1/f corner frequency of the CCIA&#8217;s main amplifier. This approach further increases the input impedance of the CCIA and eliminates the need for RRL and an analog low pass filter (LPF), thereby reducing circuit complexity and area. Local auto-zeroing and correlated double sampling techniques are also used to suppress the offset and 1/f noise of the read-out IC. The 18-bit ADC operates at a sampling clock of 4 MHz with a third-order cascade of integrators (CoI) digital filter. Implemented in a  $0.13~\mu $ m CMOS process, the prototype chip occupies an area of 3.808 mm2 and draws 1.32 mA from a 5 V supply. The input impedance is boosted from 4.4 M $\Omega $  to 5.1 G $\Omega $ , corresponding to an impedance boosting factor of 1153. The measurement results show an input-referred noise of  $2.4~\mu $ VRMS with a conversion time of 0.076 ms. The input range of the ROIC is 4.8 V and it achieves the Schreier figure of merit of 164.9 dB.</description></item><item><title>A -31 dBm Sensitivity High-Efficiency RF Energy Harvesting System With Burst Charging Mode for IoT Applications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10878509</link><description>This paper presents a novel high-sensitivity high-efficiency radio frequency (RF) energy harvester with a burst charging technology. The popular high-sensitivity scheme is increasing the number of RF rectifier&#8217;s stages to output higher voltage which is suitable to supply downstream electronics. This will reduce the input signal amplitude and power conversion efficiency (PCE), which in turn needs more stages and is thus lost in a vicious circle. This paper uses an optimal-stage high-efficiency RF rectifier to solve this problem. A low-frequency (LF) charge pump (CP) is cascaded with the rectifier to raise the DC voltage. To further improve the sensitivity, the system uses a burst charging mode to remove the charge pump&#8217;s loading effect on the RF rectifier. Measurements demonstrate a -31 dBm sensitivity for 1 V output across a capacitive load in a 55 nm CMOS process technology. The power conversion efficiency equals 31.3% at -25 dBm.</description></item><item><title>MS-SCIM: A Mixed-Signal Stochastic Computing-in-Memory Paradigm for Information Security</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769479</link><description>Stochastic Computing (SC), an emerging paradigm with advantages in hardware cost and fault tolerance, is well-suited for applications in image processing and information security. However, the existing SC paradigms suffer from significant hardware costs due to the conversion between binary and stochastic sequences, and the long latency caused by low computational parallelism. In this work, we demonstrate a Mixed-Signal Stochastic Computing-In-Memory (MS-SCIM) paradigm utilizing spin orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) arrays, in order to realize a energy-efficient and conversion-less SC method for the first time. The main contributions include: 1) The inherent stochastic switching behaviors of spintronic devices are exploited to enable the SOT-MRAM array to serve both as a parallel true random number generator (TRNG) and a CIM cell. 2) A high-parallelism mixed signal stochastic CIM paradigm is proposed to accelerate SC-based edge detection algorithm. The whole process achieves binary outputs without the conversion circuits and the energy efficiency achieves 446 Tops/W. 3) Based on the results of MS-SCIM, a novel image steganography method using stochastic bit streams is leveraged for information security, which enables lossless embedding and extraction of secret image information in a  $156\times 156$  size, enhancing both capacity and undetectability.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Flash-Based Computing-in-Memory (CIM) Demonstration of High-Precision (32-bit) Nonlinear Partial Differential Equation (PDE) Solver With Ultra-High Endurance and Reliability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10817119</link><description>Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) requires precise numerical iterations that impose significant demands on computational resources and memory capacities, which can be addressed by adopting computing-in-memory (CIM) architecture to reduce the latency and power consumption during data transmission. Among PDEs, nonlinear PDEs present heightened complexities in both analytical investigations and numerical simulations as the presence of nonlinear terms introduces intricate dynamics and mathematical intricacies. The high-precision requirements of PDE solvers, particularly for nonlinear PDE solvers, pose challenges in constructing CIM PDE solvers. In this work, a flash-based high-precision PDE solver has been demonstrated to solve the intractable nonlinear partial differential equation. It&#8217;s based on 55nm NOR flash technology with well-optimized Program/Erase (PE) schemes. Utilizing the proposed optimization scheme, the PE endurance can be largely enhanced up to  $10^{10}$  cycles, which is a record high with suppressed cell degradation and robust reliabilities. Then, applying the Fourier neural operator (FNO) to the optimized flash-based high-precision CIM (32-bit) in the hardware system, a series of nonlinear PDEs can be solved with ~2TOPS/W high energy efficiency, which is  $\sim 110\times $  higher than CPU. Our optimization strategies make it feasible to use flash-based CIM for high-precision computing with frequent weight updating and the demonstrated PDE solver provides an energy-saving solution to implement general-purpose computation tasks.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Multi-View Cross-Attention Accelerator for Vision-Centric 3D Perception in Autonomous Driving</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10950425</link><description>Vision-centric 3D perception has become a key mechanism in autonomous driving. It achieves exceptional perceptual performance mainly by introducing a novel attention, multi-view cross-attention (MVCA), for learnable feature extraction and fusion from surround-view cameras. Despite its superiority, MVCA encounters severe inefficiencies in sample, processing elements (PE), and pipelined processing, owing to the redundant and non-uniform sampling-aggregation and rigorous inter-operator dependencies. To address these issues, this article proposes a dedicated MVCA accelerator, MVAtor, with algorithm-architecture co-optimization for vision-centric 3D perception based on multi-view inputs flexibly. For sample inefficiency, a 3-tier hybrid static-dynamic sample and a sensitivity-aware feature pruning approach are proposed to eliminate the 86.03% sample overhead and 24.48% memory requirement, only incuring &lt;1% accuracy loss with no need of fine-tuning. For PE inefficiency, a spatial pruner and sequential sampler collaboration strategy is proposed to improve the sampler utilization without compromising pruner&#8217;s throughput, which outperforms the previous design by  $53.7\sim 96.1$ % energy-delay product reduction. For pipeline inefficiency, a fine-grained-tiling assisted highly-pipelined architecture is constructed in MVAtor by exploiting the decoupling opportunities on inter-view sparsity, thereby saving 61.03% external memory access while boosting the overall throughputs by  $1.83\times $ . Extensively evaluated on representative benchmarks, MVAtor attains  $1.38\sim 7.67\times $  and  $1.67\sim 11.15\times $  improvement on energy and area efficiency respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art related accelerators.</description></item><item><title>C2IM-NN: A Low-Power 3D Point Clouds Matching Processor With 1D-CNN Prediction and CAM-Based In-Memory k-NN Searching</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10836755</link><description>This paper presents a content addressable memory (CAM)-based computing-in-memory (C2IM) system designed for energy-efficient k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) searching in 3D point clouds. For autonomous driving applications, an essential process for perceiving the mobile robot&#8217;s movements in 3D space is k-NN searching. Especially with the limited hardware resources of mobile processors, the 3D point cloud is too large to upload onto the chip, leading to  $O(N^{2})$  of external memory accesses and distance calculations. The proposed C2IM processor enhances energy efficiency and reduces power consumption through three key features: 1) Dilated 1D-CNN prediction enables voxel-based partitioning, reducing the external memory accesses from  $O(N^{2})$  to  $O(N)$ ; 2) Vertex clustering reorganizes groups of points into evenly distributed clusters based on the underlying data distribution and reduces the number of points of comparisons by 49.8%; and 3) In-memory k-NN searching with CAM achieves high system energy efficiency while minimizing data transactions between memory and computation logic. Designed with 28 nm CMOS technology, the proposed C2IM achieves up to  $23.08\times $  energy efficiency, and 48.4% reduction in memory footprint compared to previous ASIC accelerators, and a 99.51% reduction in power consumption compared to state-of-the-art processor implemented in FPGA with high-bandwidth memory.</description></item><item><title>An FPGA-Based Event-Driven SNN Accelerator for DVS Applications With Structured Sparsity and Early-Stop</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10981802</link><description>This paper proposed an algorithm-hardware co-design of an event-driven spiking neural network (SNN) accelerator for classification tasks of event-based data from dynamic vision sensors (DVS), which can implement a feed-forward SNN with a maximum network size of 1 million synapses. Configurable structured sparsity is introduced between the first layer and the second layer to improve energy efficiency and balance the workload between different processing elements (PEs). The number of available neurons in the accelerator is sparsity-dependent and ranges from 1024 to 4096. The modified leaky-integrate-fire (LIF) neuron model and an event-driven neuron update scheme are employed in both algorithm and hardware to fully utilize the natural sparsity of DVS event stream. Early-stop inference strategy on the hardware enables a trade-off between inference accuracy and efficiency. A three-layer fully connected SNN is trained through backpropagation through time (BPTT) and is implemented and evaluated on Xilinx ZCU104 FPGA. Our design can achieve 96.0% accuracy on the N-MNIST dataset and 79.0% accuracy on the DVS128-Gesture dataset both at 50% sparsity. The top performance of the accelerator on ZCU104 is 3.22 GSOP/S and 3.99 GSOP/W at 250 MHz.</description></item><item><title>EdgeLLM: A Highly Efficient CPU-FPGA Heterogeneous Edge Accelerator for Large Language Models</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916480</link><description>The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly the Large Language Models (LLMs), have profoundly affected our daily work and communication forms. However, it is still a challenge to deploy LLMs on resource-constrained edge devices (such as robots), due to the intensive computation requirements, heavy memory access, diverse operator types and difficulties in compilation. In this work, we proposed EdgeLLM to address the above issues. Firstly, focusing on the computation, we designed mix-precision processing element array together with group systolic architecture, that can efficiently support both FP $16\ast $ FP16 for the MHA block (Multi-Head Attention) and FP $16\ast $ INT4 for the FFN layer (Feed-Forward Network). Meanwhile specific optimization on log-scale structured weight sparsity, has been used to further increase the efficiency. Secondly, to address the compilation and deployment issue, we analyzed the whole operators within LLM models and developed a universal data parallelism scheme, by which all of the input and output features maintain the same data shape, enabling to process different operators without any data rearrangement. Then we proposed an end-to-end compiler to map the whole LLM model on CPU-FPGA heterogeneous system (AMD Xilinx VCU128 FPGA). The accelerator achieves  $1.91\times $  higher throughput and  $7.55\times $  higher energy efficiency than the commercial GPU (NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80G). When compared with state-of-the-art FPGA accelerator of FlightLLM, it shows 10-24% better performance in terms of HBM bandwidth utilization, energy efficiency and LLM throughput.</description></item><item><title>Simultaneous Optimization of Various-Sized SRAM Instances Through Machine Learning-Driven Transistor Sizing and Leafcell Circuit Pool Construction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856518</link><description>In this paper, we present a Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based methodology for optimizing SRAM design across various configurations while meeting stringent constraints in different Process, Supply voltage, and Temperature (PVT) corners. Our method automatically extracts critical design parameters for power reduction and accelerates optimization using a BO-based approach that suggests multiple points. Additionally, our method efficiently identifies the worst PVT corners, minimizing the number of simulations by considering constraints and utilizing cubic spline interpolation to simultaneously provide optimal circuits for various size instances. By applying our approach, we achieved a significant reduction in dynamic power by 10.24% to 28.55%, access time by 1.76% to 38.16%, and cycle time by 1.20% to 27.39% across all corners while satisfying all constraints. Additionally, assuming our approach is used to optimize all size instances that can be generated by a commercial compiler, the required runtime is reduced by 96.65% to 99.87% compared to using conventional Bayesian Optimization.</description></item><item><title>SecureX: Strategically Securing Designs Against Oracle-Less Attacks Using GNN-Based Explainers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10988787</link><description>Logic locking is a promising design-for-trust solution that protects integrated circuits (ICs) from hardware security threats such as design intellectual property (IP) piracy and illegal overproduction of ICs. With the ubiquity of machine learning (ML), researchers have proposed various ML-based attacks against logic locking techniques in recent years. Since ML-based attacks operate as non-interpretable models, understanding the reasons behind the success/failure of such attacks is challenging. In this work, we propose SecureX, the first-of-its-kind technique that employs an explainable Graph Neural Network (GNN) to lock designs. The unique benefits of explainable GNN-based analysis include identifying the best locations in the design to lock, and the critical features (structural/functional) that make the designs vulnerable to ML-based attacks. Moreover, SecureX seamlessly integrates with state-of-the-art unbroken scan-chain protection techniques, thus thwarting oracle-guided attacks. We perform experiments on ITC-99 benchmarks and two types of locking techniques (X(N)OR/MUX-based locking) to demonstrate the efficacy of SecureX in locking designs resilient to ML/non-ML-based attacks. Our results confirm that the accuracy of the state-of-the-art ML/non-ML-based attacks drops to  $\approx 50\%$  while maintaining low area/power/delay overheads. Moreover, we perform a practical case study of locking an image-processing application.</description></item><item><title>A Heterogeneous System With Computing in Memory Processing Elements to Accelerate CNN Inference</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902553</link><description>Computing in memory (CIM) is one of the promising solutions to improve computing performance by integrating logic in memory. This work presents an efficient heterogeneous system based on the ultrafast CIM architecture (HS-CIM) to accelerate convolutional neural network (CNN) inference. First, an ultrafast CIM architecture is proposed based on the static random access memory (SRAM) by utilizing the novel total input and full digital scheme to implement multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operation, which effectively addresses the high delay issue caused by high-precision computing in CIM architecture. Second, a heterogeneous system based on the proposed CIM architecture (HS-CIM) has been constructed with an aligned global cache and an adaptive pruning scheme to eliminate performance degradation and accuracy loss caused by input data bandwidth limitations. Meanwhile, efficient input data and weight data mapping schemes are proposed to minimize the delay and energy caused by input data transmission from the cache to the CIM architecture, thus realizing efficient CNN inference in the HS-CIM system. Finally, we analyze the performance of HS-CIM at the layout level by implementing the LeNet-5 and VGG models of CNN to recognize the image of MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively. Results show that the energy efficiency of the proposed CIM architecture achieves 58.32 TOPS/W with 8-bit input/weight precision. Meanwhile, the inference accuracy of the HS-CIM system for MNIST and CIFAR-10 is 99.25% and 92.34%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Neural-Network-Assisted Chaos-NOMA Scheme</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10933575</link><description>We propose a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme based on three-dimensional chaotic attractors, which we denote chaos-NOMA. In this system, the chaotic signals transmitted by each user are generated from the state variables of the attractor. We employ a principal component analysis algorithm for dimensionality reduction and obtain an orthonormal basis and a signal constellation for the chaotic signals. The dynamical properties of these signals result in the transmission of time-varying waveforms, modeled as an intrinsic noise. Depending on factors such as the number of users and the power difference of the transmitted signals, this intrinsic noise can lead to a performance curve exhibiting an error floor. We propose a neural network architecture coupled to the demodulator to mitigate the impact of the intrinsic noise.</description></item><item><title>Optimized Algorithms for FPGA Implementation of PDCCH Chain for 5G-NR Base Station</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10835153</link><description>The physical layer in a cellular network base station typically runs on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) to enable reconfigurability and adaptability to meet future demands of the network with sufficient computational power. This work proposes a novel architecture and algorithms for the FPGA implementation of the fifth-generation (5G) new radio (NR) physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) using the 3GPP procedures for downlink control information (DCI) processing, including sub-block interleaver, bit selection, scrambling, golden sequence generation, and modulation. The proposed algorithms are optimized to meet 5G-NR frame timings for DCI processing with minimum power consumption and hardware resource utilization.

A lossless data compression method utilizing full rank decomposition transform is proposed to reduce redundant sensor data, thereby alleviating network transmission load. To further save communication resources and prolong network lifetimes, sensors use a stochastic event-triggered mechanism (SETM) to transmit compressed data to local estimators. However, SETM can be exploited by SEB attackers. We first derive local estimator iterations using Bayesian inference in both normal and attack scenarios. Moreover, the accuracy of fusion estimates can be guaranteed through the codesign of information compensation and an indexed transmission strategy that counteracts SEB attacks. Finally, this paper provides an upper bound for fusing error covariance under a diagonal matrix weighted fusion scheme, effectively balancing fusion estimation performance and resource demands. All theoretical results have been illustrated by the 5-Generator and 8-Line power system.</description></item><item><title>Decoupling Control of Fuel Cell Air Supply System Based on Data-Driven Feedforward and Adaptive Generalized Supertwisting Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10835123</link><description>Decoupling control of the air supply system is crucial for enhancing the performance and prolonging the service life of proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells. However, the strong coupling and nonlinearity inherent in the system pose significant challenges. Current decoupling techniques typically rely on model knowledge and commonly overlook the avoidance of compressor surge, which motivates our work with a twofold contribution. We first design a data-driven feedforward (DDF) and propose a feasible domain constraint (FDC) to avoid surge. Subsequently, an adaptive generalized supertwisting algorithm (AGSTA) is presented that eliminates the residual tracking errors of the DDF. Furthermore, its gradient descent principle and stability are demonstrated. The proposed method has been validated on an air supply system test bench and a hardware-in-the-loop (HiL) platform carrying a fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) model. The results indicate that our approach is more advantageous in terms of tracking accuracy, response speed, overshoot suppression and computational cost.</description></item><item><title>Compact Balanced-to-Balanced Filtering Power Divider With Wide Range and High Level of Reflectionless, Isolation, Common-Mode Rejection, and Enhanced Frequency Selectivity</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10810736</link><description>This paper presents a novel compact balanced-to-balanced (BTB) power divider featuring an exceptional reflectionless bandpass filtering response. A pair of three-line coupled structures (TLCSs) are utilized to provide wideband filtering response and equal power division. To enhance the frequency selectivity, an open-circuited stepped impedance stub is added to TLCSs, generating a pair of transmission zeros (TZs) on both sides of the passband. Additionally, simple absorption-isolation networks (AINs) consisting of two resistors and a half-wavelength transmission line (TL) are embedded to provide a full-band non-reflective response at the input port and achieve excellent isolation. The traditional half-wavelength TL between balanced ports is replaced by a stepped-impedance TL, improving in-band matching performance. Furthermore, a detailed theoretical analysis of the proposed design is derived, and parametric studies are presented. To verify the proposed concept, the new multifunctional BTB reflectionless filtering power divider (RFPD) operating at 1.9 GHz is fabricated and measured. The compact fabricated prototype exhibits a 10.8-dB input absorption, 21-dB common-mode (CM) suppression, and 22-dB isolation, all exceeding the bandwidth level of 263.2%. The results show good agreement between simulations and measurements.</description></item><item><title>An Advanced Fault-Tolerant HANPC Converter With Neutral-Point Voltage Balancing for Full Power Factor Range Under Multi-Switch Open-Circuit Fault</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10806789</link><description>Hybrid active neutral-point-clamped (HANPC) converters are receiving more attentions owing to considerable cost-effectiveness and high efficiency. However, when open-circuit fault occurs in multiple switches, the existing fault-tolerant schemes cannot support the HANPC converter to operate at rated output voltage and satisfactory neutral-point voltage balancing. To address this issue, an advanced fault-tolerant HANPC (FT-HANPC) converter is proposed, which is equipped with shared fault management unit (SFMU) and voltage ripple suppression unit (VRSU). The proposed discontinuous space vector modulation strategy enables SFMU to take over the multiple faulty switches with minimal redundant active switches. Moreover, the VRSU with proposed control strategy is activated to effectively regulate neutral-point voltage for full power factor range under fault condition.

In practical scenarios, due to unpredictable transient events such as faults, load changes, and attacks, the inter-generator interconnection structure undergoes random alterations. By employing Markov Chain to model the stochastically varying interconnection topology between generators, we establish a stochastic interconnected power system (SIPS) characterized by markov jump interconnection topologies. Leveraging the stochastic interconnection structure of the SIPS, we formulate a distributed sparse Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control problem and analyze the stability of the closed-loop SIPS under sparse control, as well as its optimality given interconnection structure constraints. Based on scaling technology, we introduce a new model-based Sparse Scaling Policy Iteration (SSPI) algorithm to effectively compute distributed optimal controllers under these sparse constraints. Furthermore, a model-free SSPI is developed for scenarios where system dynamics are unknown, removing there liance on system dynamics and avoiding the need for an initially stabilizing controller. This paper also provides theoretical guarantees for the stability and convergence of the SSPI. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the SSPI through an application to an interconnected three-generator power system.</description></item><item><title>Proportional-Integral and Nonlinear Cubic Control to Enhance Small-Signal and Transient Stability of EV Charging Station and DC Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11061814</link><description>A proportional-integral (PI) controller in parallel with a nonlinear cubic controller is proposed in order to achieve the objective of addressing both the issues of small-signal and large-signal stability, with the latter also being referred to as transient stability. Within the scope of application and of practical relevance is the enhancement of the region of attraction for which equilibrium states are found for an electric vehicle (EV) charging station while considering constraints. As a main contribution, a methodology for the design of the cubic controller to expand the constrained region of attraction (CROA) through sum-of-squares (SOS) programming is formulated, implemented, and validated. The developed SOS program incorporates the construction of Lyapunov functions, which are employed to estimate the CROA. The optimal coefficient of the cubic controller is obtained by estimating the largest CROA. The integration of the cubic controller enhances the robustness of the EV charging station against large disturbances, while the performance under minor disturbances is dealt with by the accompanying PI controller. As a result, the proposed PI-cubic voltage controller enhances the stability across wide operating ranges including fast charging and in the presence of constant power loads. In general, application also includes DC microgrid stability. Time-domain simulations conducted in Matlab validate the made claims. During the considered outage of local power generation on the DC side of the charging station and microgrid, transient stability was only maintained with the proposed controller, and an overcurrent situation was avoided. The PI-cubic controller is shown to be effective in enhancing robustness.</description></item><item><title>A Peak-Injection CLS Technique for PVT-Robust Switched-Capacitor Amplifier</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11007089</link><description>This brief proposes a peak-injection correlated-level shifting (PICLS) technique to enhance the equivalent gain of an amplifier against process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, thereby improving robustness.

To enhance the quality of approximate designs produced by AHLS, the existing studies primarily focus on search algorithms within AHLS, while neglecting the fact that the optimal approximate designs exhibit a higher frequency of effective error capability. Therefore, the objective of this contribution is to delve into the error correction capabilities of AAUs that have not received adequate attention and integrate them in AHLS. This effort provides new perspectives and methods to improve the quality of AHLS design exploration. To achieve this, we propose a novel metric for evaluating the error correction capabilities of AAUs, detailing its calculation method and properties. We apply this metric to two AHLS cases, and the experimental results show that the metric helps each case achieve more than a twofold improvement in exploration results and reduces the number of iterations by approximately three.</description></item><item><title>OscNet: Machine Learning on CMOS Oscillator Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11016088</link><description>In this brief, we propose a pipeline for machine learning on CMOS Oscillator Networks (OscNet), inspired by human visual system development.

In addition, the extra power consumption induced by the pre-amplification operation is eliminated, effectively saving energy.</description></item><item><title>Low-Cost Low-Power Failure-Tunable Memory for Differential Privacy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10999051</link><description>Privacy is a huge concern for our modern cyberspace, with the fast development of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. To preserve data privacy, differential privacy (DP) has been widely applied as the gold standard to offer both utility to applications and rigorous privacy guarantees. However, traditional software-based DP implementation schemes require significant computation and memory resources, which cannot be supported by typical resource-limited IoT edge devices. This brief presents a new failure-tunable memory design to achieve a local DP mechanism. Specifically, a custom 4T SRAM with multiple supply voltages is designed to inject controlled DP noise while data is stored in the memory. The post-simulation results based on a 130 nm CMOS technology show that, compared to state-of the art, our proposed design can achieve a 38% power savings and 61.92% silicon area reduction. In addition, the proposed design demonstrates enhanced controllability on the privacy deployment as compared to traditional 6T-based design, enabling fine-grained control of privacy levels. Accordingly, the proposed memory-based hardware scheme realizes DP with low cost and low power consumption, which makes DP applicable for IoT devices.</description></item><item><title>NeuCore: A Novel Neuromorphic Processor Architecture With On-Chip Event-Driven Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11002572</link><description>In this brief, we propose a novel resource-friendly neuromorphic processor architecture named &#8220;NeuCore&#8221; with fully event-driven on-chip Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning.

But their disability of directly interacting with non-spike information in the real world requests additional components to execute image pre-processing, spike encoding and decoding, severely increasing overall system cost, energy and latency. To overcome such drawback, this brief proposes a tiny neuromorphic vision processor which emulates functional regions along the ventral pathway in the visual cortex. It performs image pre-processing, spike encoding, spike-based feature extraction and classification, spike decoding as well as decision making on a single chip. To reduce hardware resources, our processor builds on a reconfigurable cortical neuron (RCN) unit, which runs different neuron models for different visual cortex regions in a time-multiplexing fashion. It also embeds biological learning circuits to better adapt the processor to dynamic edge scenarios. Our neuromorphic processor was prototyped on a very-low-cost Xilinx Zynq-7010 device. On the MNIST dataset, it exhibited a real-time inference speed of 696 frame/s covering image pre-processing to final decision and a high on-chip learning accuracy of 97.12%, while only delivering a power consumption as low as 118 mW.</description></item><item><title>A 1998-Mpixels/s 75-pJ/pixel Slice-Alternated Display Stream Compression Encoder</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11007548</link><description>Display Stream Compression (DSC) standard provides visually lossless video quality while maintaining low latency and low cost. In this brief, an efficient DSC encoder architecture is proposed, which supports 1, 2, and 4 slices per line, based on three novel techniques: 1) slice-alternated architecture, which reuses on-chip memory and computing resources across multiple slices; 2) unbalanced prediction loop pipeline address timing constraints caused by dependencies among prediction pixels, and achieve a throughput of 3 pixels/cycle; 3) default update and special group adjustment are proposed in index color history (ICH) to achieve minimal delay and higher throughput.

One potential solution to mitigate the problem is utilizing the existing traction DC grid infrastructure for EV charger connections. Such solution allows exploiting already existing traction substation equipment for both EV charging and powering DC traction grids, potentially reducing charging station installation costs. At the same time, bidirectional EV charger operation allows providing services such as DC grid voltage stabilization and traction transport braking energy recuperation. Therefore, this brief examines a scalable multiport DC-DC converter, suitable for multiterminal EV charging stations, located in the proximity to DC traction networks. The use of a multiport converter allows for sharing electric components across multiple ports, reducing the total number of elements required, compared to conventional solutions, where each EV charger relies on a separate converter.</description></item><item><title>Real-Time 3-D Thermal Simulation of Advanced Packages via Generative Adversarial Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10816122</link><description>Thermal optimization plays a crucial role in the design of advanced systems in package. Due to the large number of thermal simulations needed for full design space exploration, reductions in simulation run-time are critical. Here, we propose a data-driven approach to physics simulation by using neural networks (NNs) to cast the temperature solution process into an image-to-image translation problem. We first model the power generation map, conductivity map, and boundary conditions (BCs) into separate channels of an image. We then generate temperature solutions by training a generative adversarial network, composed of a U-Net shaped generator and a discriminator. The resultant NN model can handle diverse thermal simulation scenarios with accuracy. More importantly, our model can handle BCs, power maps, and physical package designs which are unseen during the training. Experiments show that speed wise, it enables near real-time design, providing a  $2581\times $  and  $9171\times $  speedup over a custom sparse matrix optimized finite element method and ABAQUS, respectively. Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods have demonstrated the accuracy, efficiency, and versatility of the proposed work.</description></item><item><title>Spatz: Clustering Compact RISC-V-Based Vector Units to Maximize Computing Efficiency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10836838</link><description>The ever-increasing computational and storage requirements of modern applications and the slowdown of technology scaling pose major challenges to designing and implementing efficient computer architectures. To mitigate the bottlenecks of typical processor-based architectures on both the instruction and data sides of the memory, we present Spatz, a compact 64 bit floating-point-capable vector processor based on RISC-V&#8217;s vector extension Zve64d. Using Spatz as the main Processing Element (PE), we design an open-source dualcore vector processor architecture based on a modular and scalable cluster sharing a Scratchpad Memory (SCM). Unlike typical vector processors, whose Vector Register Files (VRFs) are hundreds of KiB large, we prove that Spatz can achieve peak energy efficiency with a latch-based VRF of only 2 KiB. An implementation of the Spatz-based cluster in GlobalFoundries&#8217; 12LPP process with eight double-precision Floating Point Units (FPUs) achieves an FPU utilization just 3.4% lower than the ideal upper bound on a double-precision, floating-point matrix multiplication. The cluster reaches 7.7 FMA/cycle, corresponding to 15.7 DP-GFLOPS and 95.7 GFLOPSDP/W at 1 GHz and nominal operating conditions (TT, 0.80 V, and 25 &#176;C), with more than 55% of the power spent on the FPUs. Furthermore, the optimally balanced Spatz-based cluster reaches a 95.0% FPU utilization (7.6 FMA/cycle), 15.2 GFLOPSDP, and 99.3 GFLOPSDP/W (61% of the power spent in the FPU) on a 2D workload with  $7\times 7$  kernel, resulting in an outstanding area/energy efficiency of 171 GFLOPSDP/W/mm2. At equi-area, the computing cluster built upon compact vector processors reaches a 30% higher energy efficiency than a cluster with the same FPU count built upon scalar cores specialized for stream-based floating-point computation.</description></item><item><title>ChainPIM: A ReRAM-Based Processing-in-Memory Accelerator for HGNNs via Chain Structure</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10839072</link><description>Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have recently demonstrated significant advantages of capturing powerful structural and semantic information in heterogeneous graphs. Different from homogeneous graph neural networks directly aggregating information based on neighbors, HGNNs aggregate information based on complex metapaths. ReRAM-based processing-in-memory (PIM) architecture can reduce data movement and compute matrix-vector multiplication (MVM) in analog. It can be well used to accelerate HGNNs. However, the complex metapath-based aggregation of HGNNs makes it challenging to efficiently utilize the parallelism of ReRAM and vertices data reuse. To this end, we propose ChainPIM, the first ReRAM-based processing-in-memory accelerator for HGNNs featuring high-computing parallelism and vertices data reuse. Specifically, we introduce R-chain, which is based on a chain structure to build related metapath instances together. We can efficiently reuse vertices through R-chain and process different R-chains in parallel. Then, we further design an efficient storage format for storing R-chains, which reduces a lot of repeated vertices storage. Finally, a specialized ReRAM-based architecture is developed to pipeline different types of aggregations in HGNNs, fully exploiting the huge potential of multilevel parallelism in HGNNs. Our experiments show that ChainPIM achieves an average memory space reduction of 47.86% and performance improvement by  $128.29\times $  compared to NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU.</description></item><item><title>Tradeoff Performance and Energy Efficiency by Optimizing the Data Flow for PIM Architectures</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10816195</link><description>The processing-in-memory (PIM) architecture becomes a promising candidate for deep learning accelerators by integrating computation and memory. Most PIM-based studies improve the performance and energy efficiency by using the weight stationary (WS) data flow due to its high parallelism. However, the WS data flow has some fundamental limitations. First, the WS data flow has huge activation movements between on-chip memory and off-chip memory due to the limited memory space of the resistive random-access memory (ReRAM) array. Second, the WS data flow needs to read the input activation repeatedly according to the convolution window. These data movements decrease the energy efficiency and performance of the PIM architecture. To address these issues, the input stationary (IS) data flow stores activations instead of weights to reduce data movements. But the IS data flow faces some challenges. First, the data dependency between adjacent layers limits the performance. Second, there are huge across-array computations due to the special mapping method. Third, the previous IS data flow cannot realize the high parallelism. Fourth, the IS data flow depends on the 3-D ReRAM structure. To address these issues, we propose a novel data flow for PIM architectures. We optimize the IS data flow to decrease the activation movement and propose a parallel computing method to realize high parallelism and reduce the across-array computations. We identify and analyze the fundamental limitations and impact of different interlayer data flows, including the WS-WS, IS-IS, WS-IS, and IS-WS. We also propose a method to build a hybrid data flow by combining these interlayer data flows to tradeoff performance and energy consumption. Our experimental results and analysis demonstrate the potential of our design. The performance and energy efficiency of our design reach 0.13&#8211;1.77 TFLOPS and 61&#8211;85 TOPS/J, respectively. Compared to the state-of-the-art design, the NEBULA, our design can improve performance by  $1.4\times $ ,  $2.3\times $ , and  $3.5\times $  for deploying the MobileNet-V1, ResNet-18, and VGG-16, and also can improve energy efficiency by  $3.3\times $ ,  $2\times $ , and  $2\times $ , respectively.</description></item><item><title>Area-Oriented Resubstitution For Networks of Look-Up Tables</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10820546</link><description>This article addresses the challenge of reducing the number of nodes in look-up table (LUT) networks with two significant applications. First, field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) can be modeled as networks of LUTs, and minimizing the node count is imperative to meet resource constraints. Second, in area-oriented design space exploration for standard-cell designs, collapsing a circuit into a LUT network, restructuring it, and later remapping to the original representation helps escape local minima. Thus, the development of algorithms for optimizing and restructuring LUT networks holds considerable promise for area-oriented optimization. Substitution (also called resubstitution) is a powerful logic minimization method that can identify nonlocal logic dependencies and exploit them for logic minimization. State-of-the-art substitution algorithms for LUT networks rely heavily on SAT solving, limiting the number of optimization attempts and the size of the substitution subnetworks to one node [1]. Conversely, our method relies on circuit simulation to increase the number of substitution candidates and enables substitutions with more than one node. The experimental results show that the proposed method identifies optimization opportunities overlooked by other methods, improving 11 out of 23 best-known results in the EPFL synthesis competition and yielding a 3.46% area reduction compared to the state-of-the-art.</description></item><item><title>Design and Analysis of Optimization Method for Ultra-Wideband PA Based on Improved MOEA/D Algorithm Using Mixed Objective Function</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10818755</link><description>This article proposes a design and optimization method for Ultra-Wideband power amplifiers (PAs) using improved multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) and mixed optimization objective function (MOOF). In order to address the insufficient optimization capabilities of conventional MOEA/D algorithm when dealing with complex Pareto fronts, the optimization algorithm is improved by using adaptive weights, neighborhoods, and global replacement. Initially, based on the sparsity of the population and an external population, the weight vectors corresponding to invalid or crowded individuals in the population are replaced. And, the neighborhoods are adaptively adjusted based on the number of iterations and the sparsity of each individual. Then, a global replacement is employed to accelerate the convergence process. Moreover, a MOOF using the load impedance, output power, efficiency and gain is conducted in the PA optimization design. To reduce the difficulty of impedance judgment, a construction method of impedance solution set based on Poisson disk sampling has been proposed and employed for optimization. For validation, an Ultra-Wideband PA operating at 100&#8211;4000 MHz (190.2% fractional bandwidth) was designed and optimized. Measured results show a drain efficiency ranging from 56.0% to 70.9% with an output power higher than 39 dBm at saturation within the whole operational frequency band.</description></item><item><title>Neural Evolutionary Architecture Search for Compact Printed Analog Neuromorphic Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10818737</link><description>Printed electronics (PEs) is an additive fabrication technology which not only allows for a highly flexible printing of circuit patterns, but also produce soft, nontoxic, and degradable electronics at an extremely low cost. These properties make PE an enabler of new application domains, e.g., fast moving consumer goods and disposable healthcare devices. A particularly promising class of circuits in this technology is the printed analog neuromorphic circuits, offering efficient and highly tailored computational functionalities. In this work, we leverage the highly flexible fabrication process of PE to address the bottleneck of PE, i.e., the large feature sizes and low device counts. This issue is crucial, as it impairs the integration of printed circuits into target applications with limited footprint, such as smart band-aids. We propose an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to improve the circuit compactness through circuit architecture optimization. As baseline, we compare the proposed EA method with a state-of-the-art pruning method and a modified area-aware pruning method. All of them are able to optimize circuit architecture. Experimental simulation reveals that the proposed EA approach can effectively achieve compact circuits and outperform the pruning method by  $3.1\times $  lower area with no loss of accuracy. As a byproduct, the power is reduced by  $3.0\times $ , paving the way to energy-harvested printed systems.</description></item><item><title>Neural Rendering Acceleration With Deferred Neural Decoding and Voxel-Centric Data Flow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819500</link><description>Neural radiance field has become a fundamental rendering technique across diverse applications such as augmented/virtual reality and autonomous driving. It achieves exceptional rendering quality and reduces model construction cost mainly by introducing a novel neural representation, instant neural graphics primitives (Instant-NGPs). Despite its superiority, Instant-NGP poses severe problems of intensive computation, memory inefficiency and pipeline inefficiency, owing to numerous neural network queries, irregular memory access and intricate sampling procedure. To address these issues, this article proposes NeRA, an algorithm-architecture co-optimization framework that facilitates the efficient neural rendering of Instant-NGP. For intensive computation, we reconstruct the rendering flow and propose a deferred neural decoding algorithm to aggregate the network queries, which reduces the computational workload by 85.6% and only incurs &lt;0.5% loss in rendering quality. For memory inefficiency, a base- $\Delta $  interpolation algorithm is proposed to condense the scattered memory access and improves the equivalent bandwidth of on-chip memory by  $2.38\times $ . Furthermore, a voxel-centric data flow is proposed to fully reuse the cached data and save 88.7% of the external memory access. For pipeline inefficiency, a highly-pipelined hardware architecture with decoupled spatial skipping and interleaved sampling is constructed to eliminate the bubbles and invalid samples in the pipeline, which boosts the overall throughput by  $2.41\times $ . Extensively evaluated on representative benchmarks, NeRA attains  $1.2\sim 2.9\times $  in rendering throughput,  $1.7\sim 36.5\times $  in energy-efficiency and  $3.6\sim 8.3\times $  in area-efficiency, compared to the state-of-the-art related architectures.</description></item><item><title>An Architecture-Level CPU Modeling Framework for Power and Other Design Qualities</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10816030</link><description>Power efficiency is a critical design objective in modern microprocessor design. To evaluate the impact of architectural-level design decisions, an accurate yet efficient architecture-level power model is desired. However, widely adopted analytical power models like McPAT and Wattch have been criticized for their unreliable accuracy, while machine learning (ML) methods like McPAT-Calib rely on sufficient known designs for training and perform poorly when available designs are limited, which is the case in realistic scenarios. In this work, we propose PANDA, an innovative architecture-level solution that combines the advantages of analytical and ML power models. It achieves unprecedented high accuracy on unknown new designs even when there are very limited designs for training. Besides being an excellent average power model, we also extend PANDA to support the time-based power trace prediction, which can enable the analysis of peak power, power fluctuations, and voltage fluctuation. This is highly challenging at the architecture level. Other qualities, such as area, performance, and energy accurately, can also be supported. In addition to single design quality, PANDA can model the tradeoffs among different design qualities, such as the tradeoff between power and timing, by predicting the Pareto-optimal curve. Finally, PANDA can further support power prediction for unknown new technology nodes. Our experiment shows that, for average power prediction, our method can achieve high accuracy with a correlation coefficient R of 0.99 and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 7.91% even when only one configuration is known, outperforming McPAT-Calib which has R of -0.24 and MAPE of 35.96%. For time-based power trace prediction, our method can achieve a low MAPE of 4.34%, outperforming the state-of-the-art method Powertrain which has a MAPE of 53.8%.</description></item><item><title>Retention Accelerated Testing for 3-D QLC nand Flash Memory: Characterization, Analysis, and Modeling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10824831</link><description>3-D nand flash memory has become quite popular and is now widely used in data centers and mobile devices due to its outstanding storage density and cost-effectiveness. Larger storage capacity is made possible by 3-D quad-level cell (QLC) nand flash memory with the charge-trap (CT) structure, which stores four bits in each cell. However, data reliability is sacrificed in exchange for greater capacity. The lifespan of data retention is crucial for nonvolatile storage. Thus, an important role is played by the Arrhenius model, which is widely used for lifespan prediction and high-temperature acceleration testing. Interestingly, we discover that the conventional Arrhenius model is inaccurate after analyzing the data retention properties of 3-D QLC nand flash memory. An empirical model is proposed for changing the apparent activation energy (Ea) based on the influence of different parameters, in order to accurately predict data lifespan and perform accelerated experiments. This developed model provides a temperature- and cycle-related parameter table for Ea, which is useful for high-temperature acceleration testing examinations. Simultaneously, we observe a linear connection between the 40 &#176;C data retention time mapping and the other temperatures. We evaluate the effects of the modified Ea model and the classic Arrhenius model with the epitaxial data and conclude that the former can reduce the error by approximately 70% to a maximum.</description></item><item><title>Magnifier: A Chiplet Feature-Aware Test Case Generation Method for Deep Learning Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10836817</link><description>The development of deep learning has led to increasing demands for computation and memory, making multichiplet accelerators a powerful solution. Multichiplet accelerators require more precise consideration of hardware configurations and mapping schemes in terms of computation, memory, and communication patterns compared to monolithic designs, in order to avoid underutilization of performance. However, there is currently a lack of performance testing methods specifically tailored for multichiplet accelerators. Existing testing methods primarily focus on correctness testing and do not address potential performance issues from a hardware perspective. To address these issues, this article proposes Magnifier: a test case generation method for performance testing of multichiplet accelerators. First, we analyze typical multichiplet accelerator prototype from the perspectives of computation, memory, and communication patterns, and summarize a chiplet feature-aware operator task set. Next, we define the test evaluation metric interdevice percentile performance standard deviation and use a candidate operator set to construct a sampling space for model-level test cases. Finally, we build a generative adversarial network to learn the distribution of high-diversity test cases, enabling the rapid generation of high-quality test cases. We validate the proposed method on both simulated and real multichiplet accelerators. Experiments show that Magnifier can improve the metric of test cases by up to 3.42 times and significantly reduce generation time, providing valuable insights for optimizing the hardware and software of multichiplet accelerators.</description></item><item><title>SubMap: A Partial Mapping Strategy for CGRA Based on sub-CGRA Exploration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10806802</link><description>Coarse-grained reconfigurable array (CGRA) is a quality hardware for compute-intensive loop kernels, with its excellent balance of performance, energy efficiency, and reconfigurability. However, the efficiency of CGRA depends heavily on how the compiler maps the data flow graph (DFG) extracted from application kernels onto the target architecture. Most existing CGRA compilers encounter the challenge of long compilation times due to excessive exploration space. To reduce the exploration space and compilation time, we propose SubMap, which adaptively explores a suitable sub-CGRA for different DFGs in a target CGRA and efficiently performs the mapping process. The experimental results show that SubMap greatly reduces the compilation time compared to the latest methods while maintaining the mapping quality. On HyCube  $4\times 4$ , SubMap has an average performance improvement of  $9.47 \times $  and  $11.67 \times $ , respectively, compared with Morpher (Pathfinder) and Morpher (SA). As the scale of the target CGRA increases, the performance improvement of SubMap becomes more pronounced.</description></item></channel></rss>
