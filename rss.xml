Such a complexity challenges conventional magnetic core loss modeling methods, which are often prone to serious errors or only applicable to certain types of excitation waveforms. This article presents History-Dependent Prandtl-Ishlinskii Neural Network (HDPI-NN) for accurate quasi-static core loss prediction under arbitrary excitations. The high modeling accuracy and generality of HDPI-NN, is achieved by accounting for a more complete set of magnetization mechanism (i.e., domain wall motion, domain rotation, and memory effect) of magnetic materials, with model parameters determined by a specialized neural network. Quasi-static magnetic loss measurements for silicon steel B35A270 and ferrite N87 were acquired to support model training. The reliability of the proposed model has been confirmed through rigorous verification and comparative experiments. The results show that the proposed HDPI-NN model, even when trained only with 200+ data containing symmetric and low-frequency harmonics, is able to accurately predict the hysteresis behavior of the magnetic material excited under dc bias and/or higher frequency harmonic conditions.</description></item><item><title>Thin-Film Encapsulation Solution for High-Temperature SiC Power Devices</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10917008</link><description>Wide bandgap semiconductors like silicon carbide (SiC) are capable to operate at temperature above 250 &#176;C. However, current encapsulations cannot work at temperature above 175 &#176;C, making high-temperature (&#8805;250 &#176;C) packaging of SiC devices still a challenge. This article introduces an innovative high-temperature packaging scheme for SiC power devices, utilizing a multilayered Parylene HT/Al2O3 composite film (MPACF). By implementing a cross-stacked organic Parylene HT and inorganic Al2O3 multilayer structure, the pathway for external moisture and oxygen to reach the SiC chips at elevated temperatures is blocked, reducing the risk of moisture/oxygen contact and circumventing the thermal oxidation process associated with traditional organic packaging materials. After further modifying the interface between the encapsulation material and the substrate with a silane coupling agent, the adhesion strength has been significantly enhanced. The MPACF ensures a high operational temperature and a low coefficient of thermal expansion, effectively safeguarding the SiC devices in the hashed condition. Reliability tests including 1500 cycles of thermal shock ranging from &#8722;55 &#176;C to 250 &#176;C and 500 h high-temperature aging at 250 &#176;C have been carried on the encapsulated SiC devices, the adhesion strength of MPACF is well preserved at 5B and the devices exhibited outstanding static characteristics and switching performance.</description></item><item><title>A Constant Switching Frequency Real-Time Digital Control for ZVS Four-Switch-Buck-Boost Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916573</link><description>In this article, a constant switching frequency real-time digital control scheme is proposed for the four-switch buck-boost converter. With this control scheme, all the power switches can realize zero-voltage-switching, and the ripple and root-mean-square value of the inductor current can be minimized in the whole voltage and load ranges. Since all the control variables in any operation mode are obtained in real-time with one closed-loop PI controller and simple calculations, the inductor current in each switching cycle is optimized, and smooth operation mode transition and high dynamic response in the step change of load or input voltage is achieved. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is verified with a 300 W prototype.</description></item><item><title>Multifrequency Resonant Compensated Wireless Power Transfer SRM Drive System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891195</link><description>In this article, a multifrequency resonant compensated wireless power transfer (WPT) switched reluctance motor (SRM) with zero voltage switching (ZVS) capability is proposed. The system utilizes dual decoupled resonant tanks on the transmitting side and hybrid compensation on the receiving side to achieve multifrequency resonant WPT. In addition, the operating frequencies of the primary inverter are regulated to drive the corresponding SRM phases. The implementation of this method mainly consists of the following steps: First, the number and value of resonant frequencies were optimized to construct multiple power channels, thereby avoiding unexpected energy transfer between the main resonant circuits and overcurrent of the transmitter, and reducing cross-interference between channels. Then, the transmitting coils are overlapped to avoid internal magnetic connections, while the position of the receiving coils is adjusted to realize asymmetric coupling, thereby achieving current equalization in the SRM windings. Moreover, the optimized design of multifrequency resonant compensation networks is developed to reduce the system sensitivity to inductance mismatching and achieve the ZVS of the inverter with the minimized input impedance angle. After that, alternating excitation of single or dual phases can be achieved via a hybrid resonant excitation strategy. Finally, experiments were implemented in a 6/4 SRM-based test-bed, which verified the feasibility of the proposed system.</description></item><item><title>Charging Strategy of Electrolytic Capacitorless Integrated OBC for Electric Vehicles With High-Frequency Voltage Pulses in Intermediate Link</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902105</link><description>This article proposes a high-frequency voltage-pulse intermediate-link based charging method for the integrated onboard charger (OBC) of the electric vehicle, which can operate at bidirectional charging mode and electric traction mode without electrolytic capacitor. The integrated OBC has a two-stage configuration, consisting of a dual active bridge (DAB) dc&#8211;dc converter and a three-phase four-leg (TPFL) dc&#8211;ac converter. To improve the reliability and power density of the integrated OBC, an auxiliary circuit with a 10 &#956;F film capacitor is employed to replace the large electrolytic capacitor in the intermediate link between DAB and TPFL converters. Different from previous charging methods based on boosting operation and extended phase-shift operation for this electrolytic capacitorless OBC, the proposed method can generate the high-frequency voltage pulses in the intermediate link. Thus, most of the power devices can realize the zero voltage switching, the efficiency of the system is improved and the current peaks of DAB converter can be reduced. In addition, the charging currents with small harmonic components and high power factor can be maintained for the proposed charging method. Both simulation and experiments have been presented to verify validity of the proposed charging scheme for the integrated OBC.</description></item><item><title>An Enhanced Grid-Tied Off-Board Electric Vehicle Charger With Improved Power Quality Using Unified Control Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10904272</link><description>This article introduces a multifunctional electric vehicle charger (EVC) equipped with innovative control methodologies. In the proposed configuration, the grid-side converter (GSC) is equipped with an adaptive model predictive direct power control (AMP-DPC) system and dual active bridge dc&#8211;dc bidirectional converter controlled by modified direct power control (MDPC). These control strategies are designed to improve the power quality (PQ) of power grid, simultaneously ensuring efficient electric vehicle (EV) charging. The AMP-DPC approach utilizes a second-order generalized integrator (SOGI) to generate synchronization templates specifically tailored for single-phase systems. This control framework optimizes the switching sequence by minimizing a cost function, and crucially, it operates without dependency on a weighting factor, thus adapting seamlessly to various modulation scenarios without additional configuration. The study explores the interplay between instantaneous power and inductance imbalance on the ac side, observing that inductance mismatch impacts reactive power. A quantitative formulation for reactive power due to inductance deviation is experimentally validated, with an estimation technique proposed to mitigate its effects. A comprehensive stability analysis of the system has been performed here to further check the robustness of the EVC. Designed for unity power factor (UPF) in both grid-to-vehicle (G2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operations, the EVC maintains low harmonic distortion during charging and discharging mode. Vehicle-to-load (V2L) mode provides a reliable UPS for home ac loads during power outages. Experimental validation on a 0.5 kW prototype confirms the effectiveness of the control system in meeting IEEE 519 standards.</description></item><item><title>Series Thyristor Branches-Based Protection for Hybrid MMCs Against Valve-Side Single-Phase-to-Ground Faults in Bipolar HVDC Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10906540</link><description>The valve-side single-phase-to-ground (SPG) fault is one of the key challenges for hybrid modular multilevel converter (HMMC)-based bipolar high voltage direct current systems. In this article, the valve-side SPG fault characteristics of HMMCs are analyzed in detail, revealing that not only the submodules (SMs) in upper arms are severely overcharged, but also the full-bridge SMs in lower arms suffer unbearable overvoltage, which may destroy the devices. A series thyristor branches-based protection strategy is proposed in this article, which can handle the faults with the advantages of low SM capacitor overvoltage, low semiconductor cost, low ac-side overcurrent, and no arm overcurrent. Electromagnetic transient simulation studies using PSCAD/EMTDC tool and experimental studies with a laboratory scaled hardware prototype are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Sliding Mode Observer-Based Robust Switch Fault Diagnosis of Bidirectional Interleaved Converters for Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908094</link><description>Reliable operation of the dc&#8211;dc power converter interfaced with the energy storage system is vital for many mission-critical applications, where a reliable fault diagnosis is essential. In this article, a robust switch open-circuit fault diagnosis method based on sliding mode observer is proposed and then applied to a bidirectional interleaved buck/boost converter for the energy storage system. It uses the sliding mode observer to generate the residual, which is then sent to the evaluation module to make the fault decisions. Thanks to the robustness of the sliding mode control algorithm, the generated residual decouples the uncertainties and disturbances with the switch faults. Therefore, it shows strong immunity to the circuit parameter uncertainties and load disturbances. Furthermore, as the diagnosis variables, namely, the inductor currents, are within the closed-loop control system, the extra sensors are not needed. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed fault diagnosis method have been demonstrated by both the simulation and experimental results.</description></item><item><title>Aging and Lifetime of Power Module Packaging Insulation Due to Partial Discharge Under High dV/dt Square Wave Voltage and High Temperature</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908700</link><description>The application of wide bandgap semiconductors poses challenges to the packaging reliability of power modules under high dV/dt square wave voltage and high temperatures. The partial discharge (PD) occurring in the encapsulant is one of the main causes resulting in packaging insulation aging and failure. However, limited research focuses on the effects of temperature and square wave parameters on packaging insulation aging principle and the exact mechanisms remain largely unknown. To address that, this article focuses on the aging process of power module packaging insulation due to PD under high dV/dt square wave and high-temperature coupling stresses. The specially designed down-mixing PD detection system is applied to extract PD signals during aging. The experimental results indicate that the magnitude of PD shows a fluctuating growth trend during aging, and PD activity reaches severest before breakdown. As the temperature rises, the lifetime of the power module packaging insulation decreases, accompanied by an increase in the magnitude and pulse repetition rate of PDs. The longer rise time and lower voltage frequency of the square wave usually lead to longer lifetimes. The effects of temperature, rise time, and voltage frequency on PD behaviors are analyzed based on the discharge mechanism and finite element electric field simulation. Moreover, the total accumulation damage of PD during aging is primarily correlated with temperature, and based on that, the lifetime estimation model of power module packaging insulation considering temperature and PD aging factors is proposed for the first time, which provides the reference for the condition evaluation of the power module.</description></item><item><title>Reliability Improved Discontinuous Pulse Width Modulation for NPC Inverters Operated at High Modulation Index</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909586</link><description>In a three-level neutral point clamped (NPC) inverter, the power devices and dc-link capacitors are considered the most reliability-critical components, and their wear-out failure is primarily caused by thermal loading resulting from power losses. It has been found in a previous study that a discontinuous pulse width modulation (DPWM) reduces the power loss and improves the reliability of power devices. However, it reduces the reliability of the dc-link capacitors, and thus the reliability of the NPC inverter. This article proposes a DPWM method called reliability improved DPWM (RI-DPWM) to improve the reliability of the NPC inverter by reducing the thermal loadings of both the power devices and dc-link capacitors while keeping the advantage of the conventional DPWM, reducing the power loss without additional deterioration in output current total harmonic distortion compared with conventional DPWM. The proposed RI-DPWM method is a good alternative to the conventional DPWM to improve the efficiency and reliability of the NPC inverter operated at high modulation index which is greater than or equal to 0.898 with a power factor of 1 or close to 1. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulations and experiments.</description></item><item><title>Quantitative Characteristics of the Rotary Machinery Fault Signatures in Induction Motor Stator Current: Modeling and Evaluation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10921733</link><description>Induction motor drivetrains are commonly utilized as the power unit of various industrial equipment. By taking the induction motor itself as a built-in sensor and analyzing the stator current, noncontact health condition monitoring of the rotary machinery in the drivetrain can be realized. Reported works on this topic have qualitatively validated the effectiveness of such technique, yet its applicable boundary has not been quantitatively elaborated. This article analytically models the strength of the rotary machinery fault signatures in stator current based on electromechanical coupling. The correctness of the proposed quantitative model and its nonlinear characteristics are numerically validated via finite-element simulations. Experiments under impulsive load torque oscillation and gear wear degradation further quantitatively evaluate the applicable boundary of the stator-current-based fault detection in real-world applications. The proposed analytical model and the revealed quantitative characteristics can help optimize the utilization of induction motor stator current analysis in the predictive maintenance of induction motor drivetrain.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Open-Circuit Fault Detection and Localization Method for the CLLC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10915541</link><description>This article proposes a novel method for open-circuit fault detection and localization (OCFDL) in CLLC converters, which is characterized by high speed and independence from output load. The precise location of the open-circuit fault (OCF) is rapidly identified using voltage waveforms across the terminals of the resonance tank capacitor. After fault detection (FD), the converter employs a backup leg to address the issue and ensure uninterrupted power transmission. Compared to existing OCFDL methods, the proposed approach offers lower complexity, reduced implementation costs, and load independence. Experimental validation using a laboratory prototype demonstrates the theoretical advantages of the method in terms of speed, robustness, and effectiveness. Experimental results confirm the proposed method's ability to accurately detect and localize faults within 25 $\mu \text{s}$ and replace the faulty switch, ensuring reliable operation.</description></item><item><title>Thermal Balance Oriented Model Predictive Control for 100 kHz Large-Signal Parallel Inverters With Optimized Pulse Patterns</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10918712</link><description>In sound navigation and ranging, the parallel inverters are required to drive electroacoustic transducers to emit 100 kHz acoustic waves. Optimized pulse patterns (OPPs) can achieve the wide bandwidth of the parallel inverters with high switching frequency utilization. However, the junction temperatures of parallel inverters by using OPPs are imbalanced at a low carrier ratio. The inductance mismatches exacerbate the reliability issue. Therefore, this article proposes a thermal balance oriented model predictive control (TBOMPC) for 100 kHz Large-Signal Parallel Inverters with OPPs. First, the principle and the reliability of OPPs are analyzed. Then, the mathematical model is constructed for the inductance parameters. The initial switching states of TBOMPC are designed to identify the inductance parameters. The proposed TBOMPC takes account of the inductance mismatches and redistributes the switching states of OPPs, which can effectively balance the junction temperatures of power devices at a low carrier ratio. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the experimental results. The maximum junction temperature differences of TBOMPC are less than 1.5&#176;C under inductance mismatches.</description></item><item><title>Feature Enhancement and Extraction Method of Parallel Arc Fault in Three-Phase Motor and Frequency Converter Load Circuit</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10919210</link><description>The parallel arc fault is one of the most important causes of electrical fire. However, there is no effective detection method for parallel arc fault. To solve this problem, a fault feature enhancement method based on energy transformation and reconstruction of modal components and a fault feature extraction method based on non-negative matrix factorization were proposed. First, the parallel arc fault experiments under different load current and current-limiting resistor conditions were carried out in the three-phase motor and frequency converter load circuit. Second, the current signal was decomposed into k modal components by using adaptive empirical wavelet transform, and the energy transformation and reconstruction of each modal component were performed in turn to enhance the fault features. Third, the parallel arc fault features were extracted from the enhancement signals by using two-stage non-negative matrix factorization dimension reduction. Finally, the performance of the fault feature enhancement and extraction method was tested by using the identification model established with a least squares support vector machine. The results indicated that the proposed method can effectively enhance and extract the parallel arc fault features from the current signals, and the detection accuracy of the parallel arc fault can reach more than 95%.</description></item><item><title>Power Management of Hybrid Flywheel-Battery Energy Storage Systems Considering the State of Charge and Power Ramp Rate</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10904163</link><description>A flywheel and lithium-ion battery's complementary power and energy characteristics offer grid services with an enhanced power response, energy capacity, and cycling capability with a prolonged system lifetime. Real-time power management and considering storage components' state of charge (SoC) and ramp rate are crucial for optimizing performance. However, there is a need for further improvements in SoC correction techniques and rigorous, realistic testing to ensure accurate and efficient management strategies. This article proposes a Moving Average (MA) and fuzzy logic-based power management for a Hybrid Flywheel and battery energy storage system that optimally share the power among the two technologies, considering the flywheel's SoC and the battery's ramp rate as the most concerning variable of each technology. The system minimizes SoC and ramp rate imbalances by integrating MAs for dynamic energy demand adjustments and fuzzy logic controllers for efficient power redistribution. A power Hardware-in-the-Loop experimental validation utilizing a 120 kW, 7.2 kWh flywheel-based energy storage system coupled with a simulated battery demonstrates improved SoC correction and ramp rate management performance.</description></item><item><title>Robust Coordination Control Strategy for Large-Scale Alkaline Water Electrolyzers Driven by Renewable Energy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10906548</link><description>The multiparalleled alkaline water electrolyzers (AWE) system driven by renewable energy has received increasing attention from researchers. However, time-varying renewable energy sources can affect AWEs&#8217; temperatures, and thus change their capacity. Under this condition, if the constant droop control coefficient is still adopted, it is prone to result in inaccurate power sharing. Furthermore, the changes in AWE's parameters can worsen the control performance of the traditional PI controller. Unfortunately, these are seldom considered in AWE control system design in the existing literature. Thus, there is an urgent need to conduct an in-depth investigation into the AWE system control strategy under the temperature fluctuation condition. In this article, a droop coefficient adjustment and self-tuning fuzzy PI controller (STFPIC)&#8211;based adaptive droop control strategy is proposed. Unlike the conventional droop control where the droop coefficients are fixed, the droop coefficients here are adjusted according to the AWE temperature measured in real time. The core of the STFPIC is the fuzzy domain which is modified according to the AWE temperature. Finally, based on an electrolysis hydrogen experimental platform, which includes the AWEs and the proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzer, the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is verified. The experimental results show that the proposed control strategy can not only promote accurate power distribution and improve the dynamic performance of AWEs but also have a positive impact on PEM electrolyzers.</description></item><item><title>Global Flexible Power Control of Photovoltaic Systems Under Partial Shading Conditions Based on Direct Multipeak P-V Curve-Fitting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908082</link><description>Accurately and flexibly tracking the operating point of photovoltaic (PV) system under partial shading condition (PSC) is challenging due to the multipeak feature of power-voltage (P-V) curve, especially with the aim of flexible power control (FPC). This article proposes a global FPC (GFPC) method based on a direct multipeak curve-fitting of PV system under PSC. First, an optimized search skip and judgment&#8211;global maximum power point tracking (GMPPT) method is applied to accurately and quickly track the maximum power point. During the GMPPT process, the key points on the P-V curve, e.g., local MPPs and stationary points, are recorded, which are then applied for direct fitting of the multipeak P-V curve. Subsequently, a pseudomonotonic P-V curve is developed as a reference for locating the flexible power point according to the GFPC demands. The directly obtained pseudomonoatomic P-V curve enables fast and flexible power adjustments without redundant perturbation and tracking processes. The results of simulations on MATLAB/Simulink and experiments on StarSim platform demonstrate that the proposed GFPC method can quickly and accurately adjust the PV power adapting to flexible control demands and grid support requirements. Then, the flexibility and adaptability of PV systems as well as the stability of power grid are enhanced.</description></item><item><title>Interaction Large-Signal Stability Analysis of M3C and GFM/GFL Hybrid Control Strategies Converters Based on the Novel Fuzzy Tensor Space Method</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10908062</link><description>This article proposes a novel fuzzy tensor space method to analyze the interaction large-signal stability of modular multilevel matrix converter and grid-forming/following (GFM/GFL) hybrid control strategy converters. By addressing the challenges of high-order, strong nonlinearity, and multi-frequency coupling in the system's dynamic model, the complexity is reduced from exponential to constant levels using sector nonlinearity theory. It is achieved by optimizing the original membership function set into a linearly independent fuzzy tensor basis. In addition, leveraging the physical significance of the fuzzy tensor space reduces the mapping area for solving the Lyapunov functional problem, effectively lowering the conservatism. Furthermore, the stability analysis results obtained from this method offer a better balance of complexity and accuracy compared to traditional TS fuzzy theory. Based on the improved method, the complex coupling stability mechanism caused by the interaction of multiple power electronic devices and control strategies can be analyzed quickly and accurately. In particular, these results are used to study the impact of different configurations of GFM/GFL converters under various disturbance conditions, as well as the interaction stability mechanism of different configuration ratios combined with grid strength. Finally, the validity of these results is confirmed through theoretical and experimental verification.</description></item><item><title>Advancements in Photovoltaic Electrolysis for Green Hydrogen Production: A Comprehensive Review and Comparative Analysis of Modeling Approaches</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10912764</link><description>Green hydrogen is one of the most promising choices among hydrogen production methods due to its zero-emission, environmentally friendly, and sustainable characteristics.

However, how to achieve fast while reliable start-up respecting the permissible current limit remains challenging. In this work, we propose a simple and effective start-up strategy for 3p-DAB converters. First, by simply manipulating the switching positions, the initial dc-bias current is successfully eliminated. Then, the process of fast start-up under current limits is formulated as an inequality-constrained problem, for which we solve the closed-form analytical expression. This expression is then segmented via a newly proposed coordination transform, to bridge the control parameters and system states. With a simple segmental comparison, the global optimal phase-shift ratio and duty cycle to assign to the converters are obtained. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposal and demonstrate its considerable improvements over the state-of-the-art techniques.</description></item><item><title>Independent Charging Control Method for Dual-Channel Electric-Drive-Reutilized Onboard Charger</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10924315</link><description>The dual-channel electric drives feature a highly modular design, which significantly enhances fault tolerance and reliability of electric vehicles. The dual-channel electric-drive-reutilized onboard chargers (EDROCs) not only inherit several advantages from dual-channel electric drives, but also have benefits in terms of cost, weight, and power density. However, the charging powers of the two batteries are closely related to each other, posing a challenge for charging both batteries at the same time with the optimal charging powers. In this article, an independent charging control method is proposed for the dual-channel EDROC integrated asymmetric six-phase permanent magnet synchronous machine, which is applicable to both balanced and unbalanced battery voltage states. Under two fundamental charging requirements, namely grid current balance and zero average charging torque, the dual-channel winding current expressions which are solely associated with the ratio between the amplitudes of dual-channel winding currents are first derived. Then, the relationship between the ratio and dual-channel charging powers is deduced to realize the independent charging control of two channels. Thereafter, the independent charging control method of the studied dual-channel EDROC is designed. Ultimately, the experimental results based on a preliminary test setup validate the proposed independent charging control method.</description></item><item><title>Reference-Frame Selection on Impedance Modeling of VSCs With Fundamental Frequency Dynamics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10919010</link><description>The fundamental frequency of ac power-electronic-based power systems may deviate from its nominal value, and it is highly affected by converter control dynamics. To capture the dynamics of fundamental frequency, two impedance modeling methods for voltage-source converters (VSCs) are reported, with respect to the selection of system reference frame. The first method is to model VSCs in a reference frame with the nominal frequency, while the second method models VSCs in a reference frame with varying fundamental frequency, and hence, the fundamental frequency is represented as an additional terminal variable in the impedance model. This article mathematically proves that the two impedance models are essentially equivalent, provided that the frequency dynamics is accounted in the modeling of control delay and power stage of VSCs in the second method. This equivalence is demonstrated for both grid-following (GFL) and grid-forming (GFM) VSCs. Stability predictions based on two methods are further compared based on an interconnected GFM and GFL VSC system. The results are also found to be identical. Finally, experiments validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis.</description></item><item><title>Laminated Hybrid Metamaterial Block for Enhanced Efficiency and SNR in Simultaneous Wireless Power and Signal Transmission System With Dual-Sided LCCL Compensation Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10916725</link><description>Current simultaneous wireless power and signal transmission (SWPST) systems have a rather limited transmission distance because the power transmission efficiency (PTE) and signal transmission gain (STG) decrease rapidly with increasing distance. To address this issue, a novel miniaturized hybrid metamaterial block (HMB) with negative and near-zero permeability is designed based on two types of compact metamaterial stacks. Depending on the magnetic field boundary conditions, the magnetic fields for transmitting power and signal can be more confined between the coupling coils, thus enhancing the PTE and STG. An optimization design method for miniaturizing the metamaterials stacks is presented, achieving enhanced Q factors at low resonant frequencies. Furthermore, a resonant hybridization analysis method is proposed to achieve the target resonant frequencies of the metamaterial stacks and the miniaturization of the overall HMB. Finally, an SWPST prototype with dual-sided LCCL compensation networks is built, demonstrating a 16.3% improvement in the PTE and 11.8-dB enhancement in the STG at a 14-cm distance. The enhancement of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from &#8722;6 to 2.2 dB enables data flowing at a 400-kb/s rate to be recovered. These results show that the proposed HMB can simultaneously improve the PTE and SNR over a longer transmission distance.</description></item><item><title>Extended Hybrid Modulation for Multistage Constant-Current Wireless EV Charging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10919198</link><description>This article presents an extended hybrid modulation (EHM) technique to achieve multistage constant-current (MSCC) charging of electric vehicles using wireless power transfer (WPT) technology. Although most research focuses on constant-current constant-voltage charging, MSCC charging offers key advantages, such as lower temperature rise, decreased charging time, and prolonged battery lifespan. However, the existing phase-shift-modulation (PSM) method encounters substantial circulating reactive power and significant efficiency drops in MSCC charging. To overcome this, an EHM strategy is proposed to expand the modulation range of PSM. By applying EHM to both the inverter and active rectifier, the proposed method provides up to 16 operating modes to facilitate multiple CC outputs. Furthermore, an optimal mode trajectory, specifically designed for the MSCC charging, is developed. By implementing this trajectory across different charging stages, zero-voltage-switching is achieved for all power switches, and the overall power loss of the system is minimized. Finally, a WPT prototype was developed to validate the proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively enables the MSCC charging while notably enhancing transmission efficiency, achieving dc-to-dc efficiencies between 92.45% and 95.67% across a power range of 231 to 3.015 kW.</description></item><item><title>A Wireless Permanent-Magnet Brushless DC Motor Using Contactless Feedback and Autonomous Commutation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892041</link><description>This article proposes and implements a wireless permanent-magnet brushless DC (PM-BLDC) motor, which realizes precise closed-loop speed control and autonomous commutation by offering rotor position feedback in a contactless approach. To reduce the system complexity, a three-phase four-switch (TPFS) inverter is newly used to control the wireless motor. Incorporated with two orthogonal bipolar coils, the high-order compensation network provides four decoupled current paths to control the four self-drive switches in the TPFS inverter. By changing the frequency of the wireless power transfer, the motor phases can be properly energized to ensure a smooth operation in both directions without any microcontrollers at the secondary side. To equalize the motor current transmitted under different frequencies across a wide speed range, sigma-delta modulated pulse frequency modulation is adopted together with pulsewidth modulation, which also achieves higher efficiency and fewer effects from unexpected harmonics. The feasibility of the proposed design is validated by prototyping and testing a 4000-rpm 134-W PM-BLDC motor platform. Experimentations verify that the proposed wireless PM-BLDC motor achieves reliable commutation and precise speed tracking against load variations using contactless feedback.</description></item><item><title>Recticoil for Efficient Compact Inductive Power Transfer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892006</link><description>The MHz inductive power transfer (IPT) system has broad application prospects due to its high safety, longer transmission distance, and better tolerance for misalignment. However, the increase in frequency will lead to an increased loss of lumped components, such as inductors and capacitors, in peripheral circuits, thereby reducing efficiency. This is currently the bottleneck problem encountered by MHz IPT. To address this key challenge, researchers have tried to remove the lumped components in the peripheral circuit while ensuring the functions of the IPT system. One successful and beneficial attempt is the self-resonant coil, which replaces traditional lumped resonant capacitors with distributed capacitors formed by coil turn-to-turn capacitance, ensuring compensation for leakage inductance and eliminating reactive power. This innovative integration makes efficiency and integration greatly improved. In this article, the novel coil named Recticoil, on which the rectification function is integrated further, is proposed for efficient compact IPT. Recticoil can directly output dc power without additional compensation and rectification circuits. By analyzing a toroidal coil where two separate conductors generate a voltage differential, and incorporating two diodes, resulting in a dc output. Subsequently, the self-resonant coil replaces the toroidal coil to form Recticoil, and the equivalent circuits of Recticoil are given and analyzed. In addition, the analysis and test method of rectification efficiency is given. The experimental results show that the Recticoil achieves a rectification efficiency as high as 97.25% at 6.78 MHz, outperforming both the bridge rectifier and the Class E rectifier. Additionally, the compact construction of Recticoil eliminates the volume of traditional rectifiers.

Connecting an equivalent sensor inductor in the primary resonant tank, the voltage transient values caused by the rising and falling edges of the inverter output voltage and the rectifier input voltage are relevant to the mutual inductance and load voltage. By detecting the voltage transient amplitudes, the mutual inductance and load voltage can be identified directly for the strong coupling case. For the weak coupling case, the current amplitude in the primary resonant tank is further utilized to handle the sensitivity problem. Sensitivity analysis shows that the proposed method can also perform satisfactorily even when the system parameters have some errors. Finally, experiment results verify the effectiveness of the method.</description></item><item><title>A Repeater-Based Dynamic Wireless Power Transfer System With Controllable Detuning Rate for a Constant Output Profile</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10897908</link><description>The dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) system is an ideal solution for electric vehicles as it can maintain the power supply and reduce the battery volume. However, its adoption in electric vehicle charging has been limited due to the high installation costs, low charging efficiency, and significant power fluctuations. To address these issues, a repeater-based DWPT system with a controllable detuning rate method is proposed to achieve constant output power during movement. The switch-controlled capacitor is introduced in the repeater coil to adjust its detuning rate dynamically. Based on the relationship between the output power and the mutual inductances among the active, repeater, and receiver coils, the detuning rate is controlled to reduce power fluctuations. Moreover, increasing the detuning rate under no-load conditions reduces the losses in the repeater coil. A down-sized experimental prototype of the proposed DWPT system was built, and the experimental results show that it can maintain output power with fluctuations of less than 4.8% and an efficiency of approximately 85% throughout the dynamic process. Furthermore, constant power output is maintained even when the mutual inductance between the repeater coil and the active coil varies by up to 25%.</description></item><item><title>Unilateral Compensation for Compact and Lightweight IPT Converters With Near Unity Power Factor and Load-Independent Constant Output</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10900477</link><description>In many application scenarios, inductive power transfer (IPT) converters are expected to be compact and lightweight, especially in the charging device side. The unilateral compensation is an effective solution to eliminate the bulky passive inductors and capacitors. However, most existing unilateral compensation topologies in IPT converters cannot achieve multiple design objectives simultaneously, such as unity power factor (UPF), load-independent constant output, soft switching, and so on. This article starts from a generalized transformer model and proposes the design principle for unilateral compensation networks in terms of flexible constant-voltage or constant-current output while combating the parameter constraint of the given loosely coupled transformer. In addition, the near UPF and soft switching can be simultaneously achieved to improve the transfer efficiency. Based on the design principle, a family of unilateral compensation topologies is proposed and the design process is detailed. Finally, a 100-W prototype of CLC-N(none) compensated IPT converter is built to verify the design.</description></item><item><title>A Compact Underwater WPT System With Load-Independent Current Output Characteristic Under Wide Range of Coupling Coefficient</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902447</link><description>Wireless power transfer (WPT) technology provides an effective solution to the power supply of autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). However, the misalignments and rotation often occur between the docking station and AUV, which would result in a fluctuation to system's output characteristics. To maintain constant current output with unreliable communication under seawater environment is a barrier. Aiming at this problem, this article presented an LCC-N WPT system with fewer compensation devices on the receiver side, which is immensely suitable for reducing the weight and volume of the AUV. Meanwhile, based on the switch-controlled capacitance (SCC) technology and frequency modulation at the transmitter side, the mentioned WPT system could stabilize the output current while the coupling coefficient k and load resistance $R_{L}$ undergo a wide range variation. The determination method of system parameters, including operation frequency, capacitance value of SCC and compensation inductance under various misalignment conditions was detailed derived. Besides, the zero phase angle characteristic could be achieved during the whole process. The experimental results indicate that while the coupling coefficient varies from 0.3 to 0.54, the fluctuation of output current for the proposed WPT system is less than 4.47% and the power transfer efficiency could be maintained above 87%, and the maximum efficiency can reach 92.8%.

Traditional two-phase systems not only feature numerous magnetic cores and windings, but also have shortcomings in power loss and power density. Due to the use of a dual full bridge inverter, its number and control of switching devices are also complex. A high power density and low loss DWPT two-phase rail with II-type ferrite magnetic tooth and interval lap winding is proposed to improve power loss and power density. A circuit topology and control method with a three-leg inverter is used to simplify the system.

However, the VF regulation process in WPT systems is characterized by strong nonlinearity and is highly sensitive to variations in the inverter driving frequency. In addition, increasing transfer distances exacerbate these nonlinearities due to changing mutual inductances. Consequently, traditional approaches to VF regulation are constrained by a limited operating range, which impedes the application of WPT technology in scenarios involving varying distances. To address these challenges and enhance the system's adaptability to different power transmission distances while managing multiparametric uncertainties in WPT systems, this article develops a data-driven model-free adaptive control (MFAC) method. Initially, an online modeling approach utilizing dynamic linearization is proposed to characterize the VF regulation process using solely system input&#8211;output data. Subsequently, a switched control strategy based on the estimated data model is devised to calculate the optimal operating frequency for the WPT system. Finally, a prototype with maximum output of 3.88 kW is constructed to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the data-driven control system exhibits a robust dynamic response and strong resilience across varying transfer distances ranging from 5 to 65 cm, corresponding to a distance&#8211;diameter ratio of 0.125&#8211;1.625.</description></item><item><title>A Staggered Bipolar Magnetic Coupler for Dynamic Wireless Charging System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10906549</link><description>Dynamic wireless charging provides a novel solution for extending the range of electric vehicles, but requires stable power transmission to maintain reliability. To reduce dynamic driving power fluctuations, this article proposes a design for staggered bipolar (SBP) transmitter track with a corresponding X-type receiver for electric vehicles.

When paired with the X-type receiver, only a uniphase receiver is sufficient to achieve smooth traveling power output across full lateral misalignment range and track module spacing up to 50% of one transmitter length, without requiring additional auxiliary coils or circuitry. A 3.3 kW dynamic prototype was built based on the designed magnetic coupler and circuit parameters. Experimental results show that, without increasing width, by adjusting the pole shoe positions, the X-type receiver can adapt to SBP track module spacing of up to 125 mm, with output voltage fluctuation kept below 2.83% during aligned motion, and dc/dc efficiency reaches 91.04%.</description></item><item><title>Highly Integrated Hybrid Inductive and Capacitive Power Transfer System With Asymmetrical Printed-Circuit-Board-Based Self-Resonator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10909419</link><description>This article presents a highly integrated and compact hybrid wireless power transfer (WPT) system with asymmetrical printed-circuit-board (PCB) based self-resonators.

The control architecture of MTP-PMSM can be categorized into a centralized and distributed structure depending on the number of controllers used. The distributed control architecture proves increasingly advantageous as the number of phases in MTP-PMSM increases, owing to its modular configuration. However, minor differences in crystal oscillator frequencies among controllers may lead to pulse width modulation (PWM) carrier phase desynchronization, resulting in increased current harmonics. Conventional methods for synchronizing carrier phases in controllers rely on hardware communication systems, which not only increase the complexity of the controller, but also degrade the reliability of system. In response, our article proposes a carrier phase self-synchronization method devoid of hardware synchronization devices. The proposed method utilizes the amplitude difference between upper and lower sideband harmonic currents sampled by distributed controllers for synchronization. This carrier self-synchronization method was validated through experimentation with the dual three-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor (DTP-PMSM).</description></item><item><title>A Notch Control Strategy of Energy Storage Converter for Suppressing Grid Harmonics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10738211</link><description>Harmonic currents introduced by nonlinear loads are prone to cause grid current distortion.

The derivation and analysis are extended to single-loop grid-forming control, current control, and multiple-loop control. Correctness of the impedance model and oscillation frequency estimation is verified through impedance measurement and hardware-in-the-loop test.</description></item><item><title>Multimode Drive and Control for Double-Stator Switched Reluctance Motor by a Three-Switch Symmetrical Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10740499</link><description>In this article, a multimode drive and control scheme is proposed to enhance the operation performance of double-stator switched reluctance motor (DSSRM) based on a new three-switch symmetrical converter (TSSC).

However, because of the high inductor peak current of a boost PFC converter, large-sized inductors and output electrolytic capacitors are employed. Consequently, the power density of the SMPS decreases, while the associated cost increases. This article presents a novel control method to minimize the inductor peak current in the widely used boost critical conduction mode PFC converters. The proposed scheme employs constant on-time control to satisfy the harmonic standard as well as peak current mode control to reduce the inductor current, thereby shaping the inductor current into a trapezoidal form. Thus, the proposed method reduces the size of the inductor and output electrolytic capacitors while satisfying the harmonic standards. The detailed analysis and comprehensive design procedures for the proposed method are presented.

Increased level of conducted EMI is side effect associated with shorter rise and fall times of the voltage slopes resulting from SiC and GaN transistors&#8217; utilization. In this article the specific electromagnetic compatibility issue concerning an influence of EMI generated by SiC and GaN based converters on power line communication (PLC) reliability has been investigated. In the case of PLC communication, particularly serious problems with communication reliability, caused by conducted EMI introduced by converters could be expected, because PLC communication uses the power grid as the transmission medium.

These merits, which have not yet been described, are, in the authors&#8217; opinion, interesting both in cognitive and practical aspects.</description></item><item><title>LCC-Resonant-Type Current-Fed-Out Three-Port DC&#8211;DC Converter for PV Electrolytic Hydrogen Production Integrated With Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10739865</link><description>The three-port dc&#8211;dc converter is an attractive solution in off-grid PV hydrogen production systems for the integration of the photovoltaic cells, energy storage and electrolyzer due to simple structure, low cost, and high-power density.

Conventional FS-MPC suffers from the time-consuming process of weighting factor selection, which significantly impacts control performance. Another ongoing challenge of FS-MPC is its dependence on the prediction model for desirable control performance. To overcome the above issues, we propose to apply reinforcement learning (RL) to FS-MPC for power converters. The RL algorithm is first employed for the automatic weighting factor design of the FS-MPC, aiming to minimize the total harmonic distortion (THD) or reduce the average switching frequency. Furthermore, by formulating the incentive for the RL agent with the cost function of the predictive algorithm, the agent learns autonomously to find the optimal switching policy for the power converter by imitating the predictive controller without prior knowledge of the system model.

The ac current of the current-controlled converter is distributed by the dc&#8211;dc converter, which will affect the precision of load current control. This article proposed a novel direct load current control strategy in the ac current-controlled converter, which can provide a high-precision ac current to the load. The added inductor in the output side of the dc&#8211;dc converter can effectively reduce the distribution of the ac current. The influence and the design consideration of the added inductor on the output impedance of the dc&#8211;dc converter and the current control loop of the ac current-controlled converter are analyzed. Based on the model of the proposed control method, the comparison is made between the proposed control method and the traditional control method, and the proposed control method has higher control precision. The proposed control strategy is more suitable for situations of parallel connection between a voltage-controlled converter and a current-controlled converter.</description></item><item><title>Exact-Feedback-Linearization-Based Adaptive Second-Order Sliding Mode Control Design for DC&#8211;DC Boost Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10740387</link><description>The voltage regulation system of a boost converter operating in continuous conduction mode is a typical nonminimum phase system, posing significant challenges for the corresponding controller design. In&#160;this article, we employ the exact feedback linearization technique to effectively mitigate the complexities arising from the nonminimum phase characteristic. To address the voltage regulation challenge inherent to the boost converter with various disturbances, we propose an adaptive second-order sliding mode (SOSM) controller formulated within the Lyapunov framework. By dynamically modulating the control gain, the proposed controller circumvents the overestimation issue typical in other SOSM approaches, thereby diminishing chattering induced by excessive gain. In&#160;addition, unlike conventional adaptive SOSM methods, the proposed controller requires merely the disturbances to be bounded, without the need for the derivatives of these disturbances to be bounded. On this basis, the proposed controller ensures finite-time stability of the closed-loop system and concurrently enhances its transient response and robustness. Finally, comparative hardware experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed controller.</description></item><item><title>A Three-Channel M-Ary Simultaneous Wireless Power and Data Transfer System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745171</link><description>To improve the communication speed and reliability of the transmitter and receiver of the wireless power transfer system, this article proposes a three-channel M-ary frequency shift keying simultaneous wireless power and data transfer system (SWPDT). The SWPDT system adopts a high-frequency carrier series injection method to ensure the independence of the power channel and information channel. By utilizing the characteristic of high-order circuits with multiple resonant points, three information channels have been constructed, which can achieve serial and parallel data encoding to improve the transfer capacity and reliability of information channels. The transmission characteristics and mutual interference of power and information channels are analyzed and center frequencies of the three information channels are determined in this article. The results show that the center frequency of the information channels is almost not affected by the mutual inductance of the power coupler coils. Finally, a 1 kW SWPDT prototype with 1.8 Mbps half-duplex communication is presented to demonstrate the proposed system.</description></item><item><title>A 116.4 mg Wireless Ultra-Lightweight Microstimulator for Cyborg Bees</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10738206</link><description>Cyborg insects are considered to be viable substitutes for micro air vehicles (MAVs) with the wireless electric microstimulator. The design of a wireless stimulator with lightweight, small-size, and low-power that can be comfortably carried by insects in free motion has proved critically challenging. Here, a novel wireless microstimulator with an ultra-lightweight of 116.4 mg and a compact size of 121.8 mm${}^{\rm 3}$ is reported. It combines semiactive radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and millimeter-scale miniaturized antenna with heterogeneous integration process, thus meeting the stringent requirements of cyborg bees. The semiactive RFID technique uses radio-frequency energy harvesting to supply the power of wireless communication and then greatly reduce the energy requirement of the battery. To satisfy the radio-frequency energy harvesting requirement and realize conjugate matching of semiactive RFID chip and antenna at the same time, a millimeter-scale miniaturized antenna with compact spiral-structure is designed. A high-flexible heterogeneous integration process that combines the MCU die, antenna, and RFID chip together in the same ultra-thin substrate is proposed to solve the integration density limitation problem of the microsystem. Compared with the lightest reported microstimulator of cyborg insects, the weight reduced by almost 60%. The behavior control experiments are established to verify the control functionalities of this wireless stimulator. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed wireless ultra-lightweight microstimulator is capable of outputting stimulus waveforms into the bee's brain, and controlling the crawling deflection of cyborg bees.</description></item><item><title>Easy Transfer Learning-Based Model-Data-Hybrid-Driven Fault Detection for Battery Inverters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10740486</link><description>In this letter, a hybrid method of fault detection using data and models, based on easy knowledge transfer learning, is proposed.

However, such limitation compromises their fault current contribution to power systems. This letter proposes an arm current-based adaptive limiter for modular multilevel converters (MMCs), considering the impact of dc circulating current. The&#160;magnitude limit for MMC output current adaptively changes with the voltage at the point of common coupling, to make full use of the current ratings of power semiconductors under both balanced and unbalanced grid conditions. The&#160;proposed limiter allows for additional reactive current output during voltage sags and enhances the short-circuit capacity of the MMC. All these capabilities are quantified and validated with experimental results of the low-voltage ride-through performance of a grid connected grid-forming MMC system.</description></item><item><title>Day-Ahead Solar Power Forecasting Using LightGBM and Self-Attention Based Encoder-Decoder Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10736564</link><description>The burgeoning trend of integrating renewable energy harvesters into the grid introduces critical issues for its reliability and stability. These issues arise from the stochastic and intermittent nature of renewable energy sources. Data-driven forecasting tools are indispensable in mitigating these challenges with their rugged performance. However, tools relying solely on data-driven methods often underperform when an adequate amount of recorded data is unattainable. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a novel day-ahead hybrid forecasting framework for photovoltaic applications. This framework integrates a physics-based model with Machine Learning (ML) techniques, enhancing prediction reliability in environments with scarce data. Additionally, an innovative ML pipeline is introduced for data-abundant environments. The proposed ML tool comprises two branches: a set of regressors, each tailored for specific weather conditions, and a self-attention-based encoder-decoder network. By fusing the outputs from these branches through a meta-learner, the tool achieves predictions of higher quality, as evidenced by its superior performance over benchmark models in an investigated test dataset.</description></item><item><title>Brain-Inspired Collaborative Automatic Generation Control With Large-Scale Electric Vehicles Integration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10738205</link><description>Distributed energy sources, loads and storage equipment have intermittent and highly random characteristics, which can cause significant frequency fluctuations when they are integrated into a distributed power grid. The current multi-agent cooperative neural networks based algorithms in the distributed power grid would suffer from catastrophic forgetting issues, which might be difficult in achieving optimal control under strong random disturbances. Hence, this paper proposes a proximal brain-inspired policy optimization (PBPO) algorithm with an orthogonal weight modification method in the weight update of the policy networks. Thus the policy network can have the brain-inspired contextual awareness capability. It can obtain faster convergence to the optimal solution of the multi-area cooperative control, mitigating heavy frequency fluctuations caused by serious random disturbances in the grid. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated via the simulation experiments on the two load frequency control models of the energy integration of large-scale electric vehicles in the grid. The proposed PBPO algorithm outperforms various reinforcement learning algorithms with faster convergence, higher frequency stability and better control performance.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Factor-Coupled, Ahead-of-Time Aggregation of Power Flexibility Under Forecast Uncertainty</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10738509</link><description>The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) is significantly reshaping the role of distribution systems under active energy management. To aggregate the active-reactive power flexibility of DERs dispersed at the feeder and provide capacity support to the transmission system, it is essential to efficiently identify feasible substation power injection trajectories. This paper introduces a novel ahead-of-time flexibility characterization method to address it. First, a polyhedral non-feeder-level power flexibility region (PFR) is constructed, accounting for various time-dependent, power-coupled, and forecast error uncertainties. Then, a polyhedral feeder-level PFR is analytically derived through a coordinate transformation, which can reveal the uncertainty propagation path, i.e., how uncertainty applies to the feeder-level PFR. To facilitate the high-level application, a tractable chance-constrained Chebyshev centering optimization model is further developed to find a ball-shaped inner approximation of the feeder-level PFR. Finally, the proposed method is validated on a modified IEEE 123-bus test system. Both theoretical and experimental results show that, with appropriate robustness parameter settings, the proposed method can make the approximated PFR less conservative with abundant robustness against forecast error uncertainty.</description></item><item><title>Research on Water Hammer Effect and Cooperative Frequency Regulation Technology of PV-HBESS Compensated Hydroturbine</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10740062</link><description>The water hammer effect in a hydroturbine and improper setting of the PID parameters of a governor can cause a hydropower unit to provide negative damping to the corresponding hydro power generation system, affecting its frequency. Therefore, a collaborative control method using photovoltaic (PV) and hybrid battery energy storage system (HBESS) is proposed to compensate the water hammer effect. First, models for hydropower, PV, and HBESS are established. Second, a coordinated control strategy for HBESS and the PV system is presented, where the PV system employs a variable load reduction frequency regulation strategy based on power output and frequency deviation changes. The HBESS follows the state of charge, frequency change rate, and frequency deviation changes, with the supercapacitors utilizing virtual inertia control and lead-carbon batteries employing droop control to rapidly respond to the water hammer effect. Last, a control strategy based on model predictive control (MPC) optimized with a whale optimization algorithm (WOA) is proposed to manage the hydropower unit parameters and the coordinated hybrid battery energy storage system to mitigate the water hammer effect. The MPC-WOA can rapidly identify the optimal PID parameters for the hydropower unit. The proposed strategy effectively suppresses fluctuations in turbine mechanical power and system frequency. Real-time simulation on the RTLAB platform validates that the proposed control method improves system frequency adjustment time by 45.40% compared to systems without compensation and reduces power feedback fluctuations by 87.22%, significantly enhancing frequency stability against the water hammer effect.</description></item><item><title>Short-Term Wind Power Prediction Based on Wind2vec-BERT Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745561</link><description>In the era of new energy development, the requirements for all aspects of short-term wind power forecasting tasks are increasing day by day. However, the power condition of wind farms is naturally stochastic and variable as it is affected by multiple factors. Current neural network approaches focus only on the propagation of unidirectional attention and ignore the interaction of input variables. To further improve the accuracy of wind power prediction, this paper explores the application of the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) algorithm in wind power prediction. At the same time, GARCH series models are used for analysis and optimization after the prediction results are obtained to address the challenges posed by the inherent variability of wind. Meanwhile, Wind2vec, a new variable embedding method for wind power forecasting tasks, is proposed which can more efficiently fit the relationship between time series forecasting variables. The parameters are subsequently fine-tuned for the backbone layer of the BERT using the Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) method to make it more adaptive to the inputs of the power sequences of the power system. By BERT's bidirectional attention mechanism and transformer architecture, and refining it for the input layer, we aim to enhance the accuracy of wind power forecasts by capturing nuanced temporal dependencies within historical wind data. Using China Southern Power Grid real datasets demonstrates the effectiveness and correctness of the BERT-GARCH-M-based model in outperforming traditional forecasting methods. This research not only shows the adaptability of BERT to wind power prediction but also contributes to advancing the precision and reliability of renewable energy forecasts, paving the way for more sustainable energy utilization in the evolving landscape of new energy paradigms.</description></item><item><title>Cooperative Control for DFIG-Based Wind Turbine Generation System Covering All Operating Regions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10745778</link><description>This paper addresses the multiple control problems over the whole wind speed range for the wind turbine generation system (WTGS), including the safety constraints on the rotational speed and the mechanical power, and the maximum power point tracking, by proposing a novel estimator-based cooperative control scheme for doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) and wind turbine. Firstly, we develop a global estimator to obtain precisely the unmeasurable shift-area turbine speed, which is effective for all wind speed zones and is employed to support the decision-making of the actual operating region and the desired reference signals. Secondly, based on this, a nonlinear adaptive DFIG controller and a pitch angle controller are designed to track the reference point, which ensures the completeness of the control tasks of the corresponding identified operating region. Thirdly, we apply the universal barrier Lyapunov function to the control synthesis of DFIG to impose the physical security constraints with any adjustable safety margin on WTGS. The superiority of the proposed framework is evaluated comparatively on the detailed WTGS model using multiple Monte Carlo simulations with three kinds of stochastic wind speed processes.</description></item><item><title>Pitch Control Scheme Considering Entire Dynamics and Full-Load Region in PMSG-Based Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747229</link><description>Large-scale wind turbines (WTs) are built with light-strength materials, which would otherwise cost more than the economic benefits of power generation. Hence, these turbines with huge rotors and slender towers are more exposed to external forces such as gust winds and the wake effect during their operational lifetime. This paper strives to establish a bridge between the design principles of the pitch control system (PCS) and the inherent dynamics of the drivetrain, blades, and tower in a grid-tied 5MW PMSG-based WT. Based on this purpose, the dynamic representation of the PCS is described in more detail, then the pitch controller is designed based on the complete dynamic model of the WT using a gain-scheduled PI controller to be capable of providing desirable dynamical performance throughout the pitch actuation region. The parameters of the proposed controller are calculated according to the current operating point of the WT with the aim of ensuring the acceptable stability margin and reducing the WT loading as much as possible. The controller design process is accomplished by analyzing the linearized dynamic model of the PCS under various scenarios using responses resulting from the frequency domain, polar coordinate, and modal analysis. Finally, nonlinear simulations illustrate that the intended pitch controller has a superior response over the traditional PI controllers.</description></item><item><title>A Robust Photovoltaic Power Forecasting Method Based on Multimodal Learning Using Satellite Images and Time Series</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747271</link><description>Ultra-short-term photovoltaic (PV) power forecasting holds significant importance in enhancing grid stability. Most PV power forecasting methods based on satellite images rely on pixel-level predictions, which are inefficient and redundant. Meanwhile, current deep-learning approaches struggle to establish correlations between large-scale cloud features and PV generation patterns. In this paper, an end-to-end model based on multimodal learning is proposed for directly obtaining multi-step PV power forecasts from satellite images and time series. To capture cloud dynamics and features within the region of interest (RoI), ConvLSTM-RICNN is utilized to encode satellite images. To mitigate the impact of noise and missing data in PV power, a robust fusion approach named DCCA-LF is introduced. This approach integrates deep canonical correlation analysis (DCCA) into late fusion (LF) to strengthen cross-modal feature alignment. The proposed model is verified using publicly available data from BP Solar in Alice Springs and Himawari-8, from January 1, 2020, to October 8, 2022. Comparison with current state-of-the-art research shows that the suggested model achieves the best RMSE and MAE with minimal complexity across all cloud conditions. Moreover, the proposed approach is robust to noise and missing data.</description></item><item><title>System Strength Constrained Grid-Forming Energy Storage Planning in Renewable Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747388</link><description>With more inverter-based renewable energy resources replacing synchronous generators, the system strength of modern power networks significantly decreases, which may induce small-signal stability (SS) issues. It is commonly acknowledged that grid-forming (GFM) converter-based energy storage systems (ESSs) enjoy the merits of flexibility and effectiveness in enhancing system strength, but how to simultaneously consider the economic efficiency and system-strength support capability in the planning stage remains unexplored. To bridge the research gap, this paper develops a system strength constrained optimal planning approach of GFM ESSs to achieve a desired level of SS margin. To this end, the influence of GFM ESS power capacities and locations on the system strength is firstly quantified based on the framework of generalized short-circuit ratio. On this basis, system strength constrained optimal placement and sizing of GFM ESSs is formulated into optimization problems with eigenvalue constraints. Two practical scenarios with and without a limit on the number of selected sites are considered. Finally, quadratic support function based iterative optimization approaches are developed to address the planning problems. Case studies in the modified IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approaches under different scenarios by comparing with two other benchmarks.</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning-Accelerated Method for Real-Time Optimization of Micro Energy-Water-Hydrogen Nexus</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752353</link><description>This paper explores the micro Energy-Water- Hydrogen (m-EWH) nexus, an engineering system designed to reduce carbon emissions in the power sector. The m-EWH nexus leverages renewable energy sources (RES) to produce hydrogen via electrolysis, which is then combined with carbon captured from fossil fuel power plants to mitigate emissions. To address the uncertainty challenges posed by RES, this paper proposes a real-time decision-making framework for the m-EWH nexus, which requires the rapid solution of large-scale mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) problems. To this end, we develop a machine learning-accelerated solution method for real-time optimization (MARO), comprising three key modules: (1) an active constraint and integer variable prediction module that rapidly solves MICP problems using historical optimization data; (2) an optimal strategy selection module based on feasibility ranking to ensure solution feasibility; and (3) a feature space extension and refinement module to improve solution accuracy by generating new features and refining existing ones. The effectiveness of the MARO method is validated through two case studies of the m-EWH nexus, demonstrating its capability to swiftly and accurately solve MICP problems for this complex system.</description></item><item><title>Virtuality-Reality Combination Control for Wind Farm Maximum Power Generation With Wake Model Dynamic Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752354</link><description>Due to the time delay characteristic of wake effect, the future state information of downstream wind turbines (WTs) is required for wind farm (WF) dynamic optimization but cannot be directly measured. To address the issue, this study proposes a novel virtuality-reality combination control scheme for WF dynamic maximum power generation control (DMPGC). The wind speed in VWF is calculated by wake model without time delay, thus the future state information corresponding to the current freestream wind speed of RWF can be obtained in advance. To ensure consistency of state information between RWF and VWF, meanwhile to enhance the precision of WF optimization model, a wake model dynamic calibration method is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy of wake wind speed. Thereafter, an active wake control strategy based on calibrated wake model is implemented to maximize the total power generation of VWF, and the optimal control commands are delay dispatched to RWF according to the wake delay time. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves calculation accuracy of wake model, increases total power generation and owns better fatigue load distribution of WF under different wind conditions.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Affine Arithmetic-Based Optimal Dispatch Method for Active Distribution Networks With Uncertainties of Electric Vehicles</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752418</link><description>Affine Arithmetic (AA) is an effective interval analysis method for addressing uncertainties in power systems. However, previous research on AA-based optimization problems has struggled to accurately capture the uncertainties associated with electric vehicles (EVs) and the cumulative impact of uncertainties on energy storage systems (ESSs). Moreover, the reformulated AA model presents a significant computational challenge due to the high number of variables and constraints. This study proposes an efficient AA-based economic dispatch (AAED) method for active distribution networks incorporating EVs and ESSs while accounting for uncertainties. Specifically, an EV charging load-interval (CLI) model is developed to effectively capture the randomness of plug-in/plug-out times and initial/target energy. A confidence level is defined to prevent excessive conservatism in the CLI model. An ESS model is also formulated within the AA domain to address the cumulative impact of persistent uncertainty, ensuring an accurate state of charge monitoring. To enhance the computational efficiency of the AAED model without sacrificing accuracy, a fast-solving strategy is introduced. This strategy involves eliminating many state variables and constraints and replacing them with derived analytical partial deviation formulations that map the relationship between state and decision variables. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model and method.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Fault Ride-Through Capability of DFIG-Based WECS Using Dynamic Reconfiguration Hybrid Interlinking Transformer Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752838</link><description>The abnormal grid voltages, such as sags, swells, and harmonics caused by grid faults, seriously threaten the safe operation of a doubly-fed induction generator (DFIG)-based wind energy conversion system (WECS). To enhance the fault ride-through (FRT) capability of DFIG and improve the converter capacity utilization, this paper proposes a novel DFIG-based WECS using a dynamic reconfiguration hybrid interlinking transformer (DR-HIT) technique for performance improvement under grid faults. Multiple operating modes and flexible switching strategies were developed based on the analysis of the proposed topology and principles. The proposed DR-HIT approach smooths the DFIG &#8217;s output power fluctuations through the cooperative control of the multifunctional converter (MFC) and grid-side converter (GSC) in shunt mode when the grid voltage is stable. Upon the occurrence of a grid voltage fault, the DR-HIT flexibly switches from shunt mode to series mode, maintaining the terminal voltage at a constant value. Additionally, once grid voltage recovers, the DR-HIT reverts flexibly to its shunt mode. Finally, simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve accurate control of the system and flexible switching between different modes.</description></item><item><title>Cooperative Strategies for Frequency Control of Wind Turbines to Mitigate Secondary Frequency Dip: Coefficient Allocation and Exit Techniques</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752840</link><description>With the increasing integration of wind power into the power system, the incorporation of wind turbines into the grid's primary frequency regulation through inertia and droop control has been proven effective. However, a phenomenon known as secondary frequency dip (SFD) occurs when wind generators exit frequency regulation to restore the turbines&#8217; speeds. This paper introduces a cooperative approach to mitigate SFD. Initially, a system frequency response model is established, incorporating the combined effects of synchronous generators and wind turbines. Subsequently, a model to forecast the rotational speed of each wind turbine in response to load changes is developed. Based on these models, the droop and inertia coefficients of different turbines in a wind farm are optimized to minimize overall wind energy loss during frequency regulation, thereby alleviating SFD, while ensuring the rotational speed remains within a safe range. Additionally, a smooth transition strategy based on a low-pass filter is proposed to prevent an abrupt decrease in active power as turbines exit frequency regulation. Finally, to prevent a simultaneous drop in active power among a large number of wind turbines, a sequential exit strategy from frequency regulation is proposed. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in mitigating SFD.</description></item><item><title>Frequency and Voltage Disturbances Ride-Through Control Strategy for PV Power Plants</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10755119</link><description>Large-scale photovoltaic power plants (PVPP) are being rapidly integrated to power systems worldwide. However, large penetration of PVPP will affect the frequency and voltage stabilities, especially for a weak power grid during individual and simultaneous disturbances. This paper introduces an adaptive control strategy for PVPP to accurately comply with grid code requirements and achieve fast frequency support (FFS) and enhanced low voltage ride-through (LVRT) performance during simultaneous disturbances events (SDE). The proposed control strategy relies on the support priority scheme for the grid frequency and voltage based on real-time measurements. An adaptive active power ramp rate (AAPRR) function imposed on the active power control loop of the PVPP is used to realize the simultaneous frequency and voltage support. Moreover, the voltage support is enhanced using a voltage regulation scheme that supports the voltage recovery post-fault without exceeding the PVPP inverter power headroom. The proposed control strategy demonstrates superior performance in enhancing the transient voltage and frequency responses when the power grid is subjected to consecutive and simultaneous disturbance events. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified using the OPAL-RT real-time simulator test bench.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Approach to Determine and Maintain Area-Wise Minimum Inertia in Renewable Energy Dominated Power Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758198</link><description>The rapid displacement of synchronous generators by increased penetration of inverter-based resources (IBR) in power system areas that are potentially rich in renewable energy can lead to spatial non-uniform distribution of synchronous inertia. Consequently, even if the overall minimum inertia (MI) of the system is maintained, certain areas may experience stability issues, which would breach grid-code limits for the rate of change of frequency (RoCoF) following a contingency. Given this context, a method to determine the MI that is specific to individual areas is introduced. Additionally, a method for redistributing surplus inertia from high-inertia areas to low inertia areas is introduced by reducing electrical distance between the nodes. This approach utilizes green corridors, which are additional transmission lines that are established to evacuate surplus renewable power to the areas with higher demand and fossil-fueled-based generation, as pathways to transfer inertia. Furthermore, a machine-learning-assisted technique to compensate for shortfall in area-wise MI by placing new synchronous inertia compensators is proposed. Using this method, system operators can identify the location and size of synchronous or virtual inertia that may be required. The amount of additionally required inertia is quantified by the size of synchronous inertia compensators, to uphold area-specific RoCoF in renewable energy-integrated power systems. The proposed methodology is tested and validated in the modified IEEE-39 bus system.</description></item><item><title>Dual-Stage MPC-Based AGC for Wind Farm Considering Aerodynamic Interactions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10757357</link><description>The wind farms are encouraged to provide Automatic Generation Control (AGC) services for the power grid. However, the complex aerodynamic interactions between turbines complicate the control of wind farms for AGC service. To address this issue, this paper proposes an explicit wind speed prediction model of each wind turbine based on the control actions of thrust coefficient (mainly realized by adjusting pitch angle) and yaw angle. Its accuracy is validated by numerical experiment based on Navier-Stokes equations. Since the adjustments of the thrust coefficients and yaw angles involve significantly different time scales, a dual-stage model predictive control (MPC) is proposed to coordinate them. It uses the proposed explicit wind speed prediction model as a surrogate for the wind speed of each turbine. In the first stage, it optimizes yaw angle reference based on whether or not the available wind farm power is sufficient at the predicted moments. In the second stage, it controls both thrust coefficient and yaw angle of each turbine, in order to track the AGC power signal and align the yaw angles with those determined in the first stage. Case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the dual-stage MPC for AGC power tracking of wind farm.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Control Strategy for Enhancing System Stability in Weak Grids by Mitigating Additional Disturbance Components from PLL</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758341</link><description>Wind and photovoltaic power plants connected to weak grids can bring stability problems. The grid-connected inverter is an important connection port between the renewable energy and the grid. Some studies have indicated that the phase-locked loop (PLL) controller of the inverter can play a significant role in causing stability issues in weak grids. In this paper, a small-signal model of a phase-locked loop with complex variables is established. Then, the influence of phase-locked loop on system stability is analyzed. It is found that the presence of the PLL introduces additional disturbance components into the inverter control loop, resulting in a decrease in system stability. To mitigate the influence, a control strategy is proposed that involves injecting opposite disturbance components into the control loop to counteract the additional disturbance components. The proposed control strategy effectively improves the system stability. In addition, when compared to existing methods for enhancing stability, such as reducing the bandwidth of the PLL, the proposed method demonstrates a good dynamic response. The simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Contribution of PV Generation With Embedded Battery Storage to Capacity Adequacy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10766632</link><description>This paper proposes a real-time redispatch method for including PV-plus-battery plants in resource adequacy assessment (RAA) studies. The method offers the possibility to represent the market operation of the assets, while at the same time considering their response to reliability events, unlike existing methods in the literature that manage such assets in a single-dimensional manner, driven solely by adequacy contribution considerations or entirely ignoring this capability. In the proposed method, while the plant is initially dispatched in a market-oriented manner, i.e., with the objective of maximizing market revenues, its actual operation is adapted to meet system needs when reliability events take place. The method is incorporated into a Monte Carlo (MC) based RAA model in a computationally efficient manner, relying on a deterministic implementation of redispatching that does not impact significantly the computational burden of the RAA model, thus enabling the execution of multiple MC samples to achieve a high stochastic process accuracy. A merit order algorithm is also embedded into the RAA model to evaluate the PV-plus-battery market revenues. The model developed allows a refined calculation of the capacity value (CV) of such assets for different plant configurations and inverter loading ratios, while the upper and lower CV bounds are approximated via application of the adequacy- and market-oriented approaches available in the literature. Results show that the embedded storage energy capacity is crucial for the CV afforded by the assets, while any decrease in the inverter capacity does not significantly impact the CV value. Further, the CV of storage embedded in tightly coupled PV-plus-battery plants, where batteries are exclusively charged by the plant's own PV generation, is generally lower than the value of similar stand-alone storages operating without any charging constraints.</description></item><item><title>Adversarial Constraint Learning for Robust Dispatch of Distributed Energy Resources in Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10766908</link><description>The variability of renewables and power demands poses significant challenges for the dispatch of distributed energy resources (DERs) in distribution networks, as they often introduce uncertainties that may lead to power flow constraint violations. Robust optimization (RO) is a powerful tool for managing the operational risks caused by these uncertainties. However, solving robust DER dispatch problems is nontrivial since the non-convex AC power flow constraints prevent the use of strong duality to find deterministic counterparts. To this end, this paper proposes adversarial constraint learning that can provide linear surrogates for robust dispatch problems. This method begins by designing a gradient-based adversarial attack process to identify the worst-case constraint violations. A &#8220;teacher&#8221; model is trained in advance to enable rapid gradient calculations during this attack process. Under the teacher's supervision, two &#8220;student&#8221; models are then trained to predict the worst-case violation from candidate dispatch decisions and nominal operating conditions (i.e., renewable generation and power demands). These student models are further reformulated into equivalent mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) forms and serve as computationally efficient surrogates for the original robust dispatch problems. Simulations across various operating conditions and test systems demonstrate that our method can achieve desirable feasibility, low suboptimality, and high online computational efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Online Stream-Driven Energy Management in Microgrids Using Recurrent Neural Networks and SustainaBoost Augmentation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10768873</link><description>In recent years, the operation of microgrids (MG) has faced increasing challenges due to the growing penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) and the integration of electric vehicles (EVs), which introduce significant uncertainties in power supply and demand dynamics. In response, neural network-based approaches emerge as promising solutions, adept at handling vast databases and learning diverse patterns for real-time decision-making. This paper proposes an online stream-driven energy management strategy for efficient grid-connected MG power management and cost minimization. The strategy considers the presence of EVs and RES, while also addressing the impact of noisy data. The strategy incorporates a recurrent neural network (RNN) to learn from time-series data and make real-time decisions. Additionally, an augmentation technique called SustainaBoost (SB) is introduced, designed to boost system sustainability and enhance the training quality of neural networks. The proposed RNN achieves 98.7% optimality in minimizing the operational costs of the MG on the test dataset.</description></item><item><title>Distributionally Robust Bilevel Optimization Model for Distribution Network With Demand Response Under Uncertain Renewables Using Wasserstein Metrics</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771664</link><description>We consider a distribution network integrating demand response (DR) participants in the presence of uncertain renewable suppliers and outdoor temperatures. A bilevel optimization model is proposed to capture the intricate dynamics between price-incentivized DR participants and distribution system operations, including energy procurement and active/reactive power flows. The model is formulated as a distributional robust bilevel optimization using Wasserstein metrics. We show favorable data-driven properties including out-of-sample guarantee and asymptotic consistency. Furthermore, we present a tractable mixed-integer linear programming reformulation and characterize the worst-case distribution. Computational experiments are conducted on a modified 33-bus system. Our findings underscore the efficacy of the pricing strategies derived from the proposed bilevel optimization model. These strategies not only effectively manage DR participants' behavior but also bring equity considerations among households with various characteristics to light. The results contribute to a deeper understanding of the interplay between distribution system operators and DR participants.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Objective Performance Enhancement of Offshore Wind Turbines Through Planning Controller Parameter: A &#8216;Plan-Control&#8217; Hierarchical Controller</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772167</link><description>Large-scale offshore wind turbines (OWTs) are manufactured with pronounced flexible structures and operated in complex wind-wave coupled environment, thereby imposing high demands on the controller performance. Existing advanced control strategies have altered the architecture of industry-standard controller, hindering their application in industrial projects. This study aims to propose a novel &#8216;Plan-Control&#8217; Hierarchical Controller (PCHC) for OWTs, with the inner &#8216;Control&#8217; loop utilizing an industry-standard controller and the outer &#8216;Plan&#8217; loop integrating a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC)-based planner. For the inner loop, the controller provides reference signals of generator torque and blade pitch to actuators of OWTs, with controller parameters, optimal constant in torque control and proportional-integral (PI) gains in pitch control, being transferred from the planner. For the outer loop, an NMPC-based planner determines controller parameters by solving multi-objective optimization formulations with variable prediction horizons. Interestingly, NMPC-based planner does not operate as often as controller in PCHC, but compensates for the residual error, arising from the mismatch of state-space model in the multi-step prediction process, by Gaussian Process regression. A cost function is jointly formulated to suppress mechanical power and rotor speed fluctuations, reduce structural loads, and restrict actuators' actions, with weighting factors tuned online and robustly. Finally, the multi-objective performance enhancement of the PCHC in power and speed stability, and structural load mitigations is demonstrated utilizing aero-hydro-servo-elasto-soil simulations with actual wind-wave environmental conditions. The PCHC maintains the architecture of the industrial-standard controller, thus smoothing the way for its implementation in industrial projects of OWTs.</description></item><item><title>Internal Energy Distribution Control Based Fault Ride-Through and Postfault Recovery Strategy for Offshore Wind Farms Connected to DR-MMC HVDC Under Onshore AC Grid Faults</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772121</link><description>Offshore wind farms (OWF) connected to diode rectifier (DR) and modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based HVDC confront challenges of surplus power induced by onshore AC faults. This paper proposes an internal energy distribution control (IEDC) strategy, which utilizes the rotor kinetic energy (KE) of wind turbines (WT) and the capacitor energy of MMC submodules to achieve fault ride-through (FRT) and postfault recovery (PFR). Firstly, the mechanism of OWF is analyzed, and an onshore AC fault detection method based on local measurements is proposed. Then, a two-stage FRT control strategy is proposed. Three preset power reduction and energy absorption curves are designed to utilize the internal energy to actively absorb excess power, and flexibly distribute surplus power to KE and MMC energy. An additional pitch angle control (APAC) is devised, which can reduce captured wind power and eliminate surplus power when the internal energy reaches its maximum value. Thirdly, a two-stage PFR control strategy is proposed. The preset power and energy recovery curves are designed to achieve fast active power recovery and release of stored excess internal energy after fault clearance. Case studies are performed on 2-terminal and 4-terminal test systems to validate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed strategy.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Area-Multi-Stage Based Self-Healing Distribution Network Planning and Operation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787104</link><description>Extreme events such as earthquakes, floods, or wars could cause severe grid faults and large-scale outages in the distribution network. The active islanding technology can be used for self-healing of multiple outage areas with distributed resources, smart distribution facilities, and advanced controlling methods. The facilities related to the self-healing consist of relays, switches, distributed resources, and power electronics based soft open points (SOPs). However, the self-healing effect depends on not only the location, capability, and function of these facilities, but also the recovery process should be comprehensively considered and coordinated since the multi-stage recovery strategies are deeply coupled. These recovery stages usually consist of the relaying process, grid partition with smart switches (SSWs), resupply by distributed resources, and interconnection with SOPs. For the first time, this paper proposes a multi-area-multi-stage (MAMS) self-healing recovery area (RA) planning-operation collaborative approach considering the recovery sequence. First, the multiple self-healing stages of flexible RAs are defined and introduced. Second, the time-variant topological and operational constraints are proposed to represent the coupling relationships at different stages. Finally, the hybrid controllable load deployment strategy is used to compensate for the limited resource capacity in RA restoration. The effectiveness of the proposed collaborative model is verified by illustrative case studies.</description></item><item><title>Tube-Based Linear Parameter-Varying Model Predictive Control for Wind Energy Conversion Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10787116</link><description>Maximum power extraction and transfer from wind energy conversion systems (WECS) to the power grid depends on a high-performance control system. This paper proposes a robust tube-based linear parameter-varying (LPV) model predictive controller (MPC) for rotor speed and stator's active and reactive power control of a Doubly-Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) based WECS. The turbine dynamics and the DFIG is modeled as a single LPV system, which enables the model transformation into an equivalent linear time-invariant (LTI) system to avoid online updates of the prediction matrix. Based on the LTI representation, a tube-based LPV MPC (TLPVMPC) is developed, consisting of a tracking nominal MPC with tightened constraint sets and a disturbance controller. In the proposed method, the disturbance upper bound is estimated by Kalman filtering, which provides less conservative performance. The proposed controller is compared to sliding mode control (SMC), LPVMPC and nonlinear MPC (NMPC) methods. Simulations are conducted under model uncertainties and partial faults in the DFIG control voltages. The results show the robust performance of the proposed controller in power extraction and reduction of mechanical stress build-up compared to the other control methods.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Voltage Control of Inverter-Based DG in Active Distribution Networks With Measurement-Strategy Mapping Matrix</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10795660</link><description>The high penetration of distributed generators (DGs) has exacerbated voltage violations in active distribution networks (ADNs). The sensitivity, as the law between nodal power injection and state variation, can be used to develop DG strategies. However, due to the nonlinearity, the accurate description and efficient application of sensitivity have become an important challenge in the establishment of DG control strategy. In this paper, an adaptive voltage control strategy for DGs is developed based on ADN sensitivity. First, the measurement-strategy mapping matrix is established to describe the complex time-varying sensitivity. The sensitivity between nodal voltage and reactive power is described as discrete matrix elements, which are generated based on the Koopman operator. Then, an adaptive voltage control model is built based on the measurement-strategy mapping matrix, in which the lifted linear decision rule (LLDR) is introduced to continue the discrete matrix elements as a couple of constraints. Efficient formulation of DG strategies is realized in a data-driven manner based on ADN sensitivity. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated using the IEEE 33-node system, practical 53-node system, and IEEE 123-node system. The proposed strategy can effectively cope with voltage problems while enhancing the adaptability to variations in practical operation.</description></item><item><title>Planning of Stationary-Mobile Integrated Battery Energy Storage Systems Under Severe Convective Weather</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10806563</link><description>Under extreme weather events represented by severe convective weather (SCW), the adaptability of power system and service restoration have become paramount. To this end, this paper presents a novel planning method of stationary-mobile integrated battery energy storage system (SMI-BESS) capable of spatial flexibility. This designed system can flexibly switch between stationary and mobile modes to cope with normal operation and extreme weather events. Considering the multitude of threats posed of SCW, such as extreme wind speed, lightning strikes, and hail, a comprehensive fragility model of the distribution network is established to quantify adverse impacts of the extreme event. Uncertainties in renewable energy generation and distribution network failures are characterized using two types of ambiguity sets. A two-stage adaptive distributionally robust optimization (2S-ADRO) model is developed to plan the SMI-BESS in detail, meeting the requirements of mobile energy storage. Finally, case studies are conducted using weather and grid data from some regions in China to validate the effectiveness of the proposed structure and method.</description></item><item><title>DC Collector System Layout Optimization for Offshore Wind Farm With SPP Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804676</link><description>With the rapid development of global offshore wind power, the scale and capacity of offshore wind farms (OWF) are continuously expanding, making it crucial to enhance the overall economic efficiency of OWFs. However, previous studies on DC collector systems of OWFs mainly focus on the DC series-parallel (SP) topology, which escalates the overall costs. To optimize the collector system layout, this paper proposes a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) based framework for improving the overall economic efficiency by leveraging an advanced DC series-parallel-parallel (SPP) topology. In the proposed framework, a hierarchical open-loop multiple travelling salesman problem (HOMTSP) is utilized to model the SPP topology, decomposing the collector system layout optimization (CSLO) problem into sub-problems for resolution. Subsequently, a hierarchical double Q-learning (DQL) is employed to solve these sub-problems, with a topology-guided mechanism to refine the routing results and correct crossed cables by incorporating topological characteristics. Furthermore, this study acquires the GIS data and the connection scheme of wind turbines in a real OWF for the case study. Numerical results show the SPP-based framework significantly improves the economic efficiency compared to the DC SP topology and the AC double-sided ring topology.</description></item><item><title>A Novel Design for Switchable Grid-Following and Grid-Forming Control</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10811873</link><description>This paper presents the design of a novel grid-forming (GFM) control structure adapted from a typical grid-following (GFL) control structure with minimal edits, thereby enabling a switchable control structure for voltage sourced converters (VSCs) to operate in either GFL or GFM mode by simply switching a flag manually. The VSC is shown to be able to operate in the GFL control mode synchronizing to the main grid through a phase-locked-loop (PLL) and operate as a GFM controller with power-based synchronization for both grid-connected and islanded conditions. To guarantee smooth operation, the control schemes and the mode switching logic have been carefully designed and examined via a series of experiments. The experiment results show that the switchable control structure can fulfill the desired control and operation functions and enable smooth transition between control modes.</description></item><item><title>Intraday Wind Power Forecasting by Ensemble of Overlapping Historical Numerical Weather Predictions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10812675</link><description>The numerical weather prediction (NWP) is crucial to improve intraday wind power forecasting (WPF) accuracy. However, conventional WPF methods relied solely on a latest reported single NWP, overlooking hidden information from sequentially reported multiple historical NWPs that are partially overlapped over time. Additionally, it's challenging to tackle intraday WPF as it involves both ultra-short-term and short-term horizons with different characteristics. Therefore, a novel spatio-temporal representation learning network is proposed for intraday WPF by ensemble of overlapping historical NWPs. Initially, an integrated mask-reconstruction representation learning pretraining strategy is employed to extract hidden representations of historical wind power measurements and overlapping historical NWPs, providing contextual information for the subsequent intraday WPF task. Then, the output layer is trained and end-to-end fine-tuning of the entire network is conducted to adapt to the specific forecasting task. Moreover, a multi-task learning strategy based on hard parameter sharing is adopted to ensure balanced predictive accuracy across each of forecasted wind farms. Case study and detailed ablation tests based on 5 real-world wind farms demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the forecasting accuracy of most wind farms by leveraging spatio-temporal correlation, achieving the best average performance across all time horizons compared to the baseline models.</description></item><item><title>Event-Triggered H-Infinity Pitch Control for Floating Offshore Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10820839</link><description>The complex wind and wave environment can lead to increased external disturbances and power fluctuations of floating offshore wind turbines, posing a significant challenge to their stable operation. To cope with this issue, this paper formulates an event-triggered H-infinity pitch control strategy for floating offshore wind turbines. Firstly, a linear parameter varying model of floating offshore wind turbines is proposed, utilizing the dynamic characteristics of subsystems while considering the combined external disturbances from wind and wave. Then, the event-triggered control strategy is introduced into the H-infinity pitch control of floating offshore wind turbines. Based on this, a criterion for the asymptotic stability and H-infinity norm boundedness of floating offshore wind turbines is derived. Furthermore, an algorithm is presented for designing feedback gain matrices of the event-triggered H-infinity pitch control, which can effectively reduce the update frequency of the controller. Finally, a simulation is conducted on the IEA 15 MW Reference Wind Turbine by integrating OpenFAST with MATLAB/Simulink. The simulation results provide a comparative analysis of the event-triggered H-infinity pitch control strategy and the continuous-time pitch control strategy, demonstrating the superiority of the method proposed in this paper.</description></item><item><title>Frequency Constrained Dispatch With Energy Reserve and Virtual Inertia From Wind Turbines</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10840325</link><description>With the increasing penetration of wind power and gradual retirement of conventional generating units (CGUs), wind turbines (WTs) become promising resources to provide steady-state energy reserve (ER) and frequency support for the grid to facilitate supply-demand balance and frequency security. In this regard, a novel frequency constrained dispatch framework with ER and virtual inertia from WTs is proposed. Firstly, this paper establishes the WT model with both ER and virtual inertia, whose energy sources are WT's deloading and rotor kinetic energy, respectively. Secondly, the system frequency response and CGUs' power response are derived while considering WTs exiting inertia response at frequency nadir. Then, this paper develops a stochastic-optimization-based frequency constrained dispatch model, where both WTs' frequency regulation parameters and rotor speeds are decision variables, so that the coupling between WT's mechanical and electrical parts and the coupling between system's transient dynamics and steady-state operation can be fully reflected. Finally, convex hull relaxation, convex hull approximation and deep neural networks are used to transform the original nonlinear model into a mixed-integer second-order cone programming model. Case studies on the 118-bus system verify the effectiveness of the proposed models and methods.</description></item><item><title>Secondary Frequency Regulation From Aggregated Distributed Photovoltaics: A Dynamic Flexibility Aggregation Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10840304</link><description>To fully utilize the potential of massive small-scale distributed photovoltaics (DPVs) for secondary frequency regulation (SFR), this article introduces a hierarchical coordination framework that incorporates the dynamic response characteristic (DRC) of DPV to automatic generation control (AGC) signals, thereby reflecting the dynamic flexibility of the aggregated DPVs (ADPVs). First, a reserved power feasible range is derived for scheduling the power reserve control (PRC) scheme considering the uncertainty in PV generation and the de-loaded margin base constraint. Second, a two-stage multi-cluster DRC aggregation method that considers the impact of the PRC scheme is developed to describe the equivalent DRC of the ADPVs. Last, the article constructs an integrated cost function (ICF) that reveals the interdependencies between SFR capacity, equivalent DRC and regulation cost, which enables the decoupled scheduling of the SFR indices and the PRC scheme. An event-triggered duty factor reassignment mechanism is further proposed to improve the reliability of SFR service deployment in case of unexpected events. Simulation results indicate that the framework is an efficient approach for quantifying, trading and realizing the dynamic flexibility of the ADPVs.</description></item><item><title>Optimal Scheduling and Commercial Testbed-Based Verification of Integrated PV-ESS Systems Considering Settlement Rules in South Korea</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10842237</link><description>This article proposes an optimal scheduling algorithm for an integrated PV-ESS system to maximize the overall revenue from both system marginal price (SMP) and renewable energy certificate (REC), considering detailed settlement rules in South Korea.

This paper presents a multi-objective bi-level LVRT control strategy for the two-stage PV grid-connected system to maximize the positive and negative sequence voltage support capability while ensuring safe operation under asymmetrical faults. The AC level controls the grid side inverter, while the DC level regulates the boost converter. The grid voltage support control strategy is implemented at the AC level to support the positive and negative sequence voltage of the point of common coupling. Considering there is an inherent contradiction between grid voltage support with the overcurrent of inverter and DC voltage oscillation, the current references are automatically adjusted to facilitate the maximum positive and negative voltage support while limiting the overcurrent and oscillation of DC-link voltage. Based on the power reference shared from the AC level, the DC level regulates the boost converter to stabilize the DC-link voltage speedily by utilizing the compensation current. Finally, simulations and experiments demonstrate the voltage support capability and fast dynamic response characteristics of DC-link voltage in different scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Peak Shaving Control for a Virtual Synchronous Generator in Island Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10749988</link><description>A virtual synchronous generator (VSG) can be considered a voltage source with an emulated inertial response. Depending on the grid condition, however, it is necessary to limit the output current, which renders the inverter dynamics and makes the inverter prone to losing synchronism with the grid. To address this well-known challenge, in this article, we propose a novel control method for a VSG that can achieve current limiting with stability. We describe the proposed VSG with block diagrams and validate its control responses with transfer functions. The proposed VSG can be useful to enhance the frequency stability of an island grid, which is more vulnerable to disturbances by nature than a large interconnected system. We use a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) setup for further validation. Using the HIL environment, we test the proposed VSG in an island system operating with diesel generators for generator trips, low-frequency oscillations, and voltage sags. We also test the VSG in a single-inverter-infinite-bus setup to evaluate its transient stability and compare it to ones with conventional current-limiting methods. Although the current limiting shaves the peak power of the VSG, it ensures continuous inertial and damping responses without compromising stability.</description></item><item><title>Performance-Guaranteed Finite-Time Secondary Control for Islanded AC Microgrids With Time-Varying Disturbances</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829834</link><description>This paper investigates distributed finite-time secondary control of islanded AC microgrids with prescribed performance subject to time-varying disturbances. By specifying the desired performance function, the transient and steady-state performances (including the convergence rate, the maximum overshoot, and the maximum steady-state error) of both the voltage and frequency restoration processes are considered in the design phase. Given the microgrid modeling inaccuracies and load-switching effects, the time-varying disturbances lump unmodeled dynamics, parameter perturbations, and exogenous load disturbances. A novel control scheme, which consists of two main parts, is established. In the first part, reference signal generators are constructed to produce the restoration references in a finite time for each power unit. In the second part, with the observer-based disturbance rejection technique and the prescribed performance control philosophy, performance-guaranteed finite-time secondary controllers are designed such that the finite-time restoration task with the prescribed performance is fulfilled, and the time-varying disturbance rejection is achieved. Rigorous stability analysis and case studies are conducted to verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Coordination of Smart Hybrid Transformers in Distribution Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10770240</link><description>A hybrid transformer is a combination of a conventional transformer and power electronics, which can be used to help alleviate power quality issues in distribution networks at lower costs than solid-state transformers.

However, a significant power imbalance at the MF onset will result in the violation of dynamic frequency constraints, especially in low-inertia wind power penetrated distribution systems (WPP-DSs). To ensure the secure MF after emergencies, this paper proposes a frequency constrained proactive scheduling method for WPP-DSs. The primary frequency response (PFR) model is proposed to describe the microgrid frequency dynamics after islanding, where wind turbines are deloaded to provide a primary reserve. Then the PFR model is incorporated into the scheduling model to ensure frequency security during MF process. The proposed method proactively dispatches controllable units to mitigate the power imbalance and to reserve power for frequency regulation. After emergencies, the primary reserve is released, and adaptive microgrids are securely formed to sustain critical services. The PFR model is formulated as algebraic differential equations (ADEs), which makes it difficult to solve the model directly. Thus, the PFR model is discretized into difference equations and further linearized to facilitate solution. Simulation results validate the merits of the proposed method in reducing the conservatism of proactive scheduling strategies and improving the microgrid security during MF process.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Timescale Security Evaluation and Regulation of Integrated Electricity and Heating System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10747833</link><description>The ability to operate across multiple timescales is vital for the flexibility enhancement of integrated electricity and heating systems (IEHS).

On this basis, a rolling security evaluation and regulation strategy that is cognizant of the asynchronous behaviors in power and heating systems is tailored. Case studies validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method to ensure the IEHS&#8217;s security.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Coordinated Robust Planning of Multi-Energy Ship Microgrids Considering Thermal Inertia and Ship Navigation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10834446</link><description>As maritime technology advances, multi-energy ship microgrids (MESMs) are widely used in large cruise tourism. In this context, studying cost-effective and highly reliable energy system planning methods for MESMs in their whole lifespan becomes paramount. Therefore, this paper proposes a joint planning method for a MESM during its lifespan. Firstly, a long timescale coordinated planning and operation scheme is formulated with the aim of maximizing the Net Present Value (NPV) value, thereby reducing both project investment and energy supply cost. In addition, this paper introduces novel operation models that incorporate customer thermal comfort levels, considering thermal inertia, and ship navigation, accounting for the effects of waves and wind. These models enhance the flexibility and practicality of the planning process. Finally, to ensure the safe operation of vessel and alleviate the negative effects of uncertain wind and waves during ship navigation, a robust optimization (RO) approach is employed. A case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, with several comparison analyses further highlighting its advantages.</description></item><item><title>Two-Stage Robust Planning for Park-Level Integrated Energy System Considering Uncertain Equipment Contingency</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10834468</link><description>To enhance the reliability of Integrated Energy Systems (IESs) and address the research gap in reliability-based planning methods, this paper proposes a two-stage robust planning model specifically for park-level IESs. The proposed planning model considers uncertainties like load demand fluctuations and equipment contingencies, and provides a reliable scheme of equipment selection and sizing for IES investors. Inspired by the unit commitment problem, we formulate an equipment contingency uncertainty set to accurately describe the potential equipment contingencies which happen and can be repaired within a day. Then, a modified nested column-and-constraint generation algorithm is applied to solve this two-stage robust planning model with integer recourse efficiently. In the case study, the role of energy storage system for IES reliability enhancement is analyzed in detail. Computational results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed model over other planning models in terms of improving reliability.</description></item><item><title>Resilient Preparation and Restoration Strategy for Integrated Electric-Gas Distribution Systems Considering Mobile Energy Storage</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10835752</link><description>Extreme events can interrupt both electricity and gas supply in an integrated electric-gas distribution system (IEGDS). This work proposes a two-stage resilient preparation and restoration strategy to efficiently restore both electric and gas load services in IEGDS after extreme events considering the utilization of mobile energy storage (MES). To minimize the load loss under the damage uncertainty and limited MES resources, a unified MES assigning and dispatching strategy is proposed to optimally coordinate the numbers and locations of pre-event and post-event MES dispatching. To address the MES assigning and pre-event dispatching problems under the damage uncertainty, a two-stage stochastic optimization model is developed, which is efficiently solved by a proposed selective progressive hedging (PH) algorithm. The out-of-sample analysis indicates that the proposed methods can achieve a 53.10% reduction in average load loss compared to scenarios without MES. In addition, the proposed unified MES assigning and dispatching strategy outperforms the preparation-only and restoration-only MES dispatching strategies by reducing 2.65% and 7.13% of average load loss, respectively. Moreover, the proposed selective algorithm can reduce 7.23% to 30.53% of the computational burden compared to the conventional PH algorithm.</description></item><item><title>Multi-Time Scale Model Predictive Control-Based Demand Side Management for a Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750304</link><description>The microgrid (MG) integrating clean renewable energy has increasingly emerged as a critical solution for addressing energy challenges and promoting sustainable energy development. However, the inherent uncertainties in renewable energy output and load consumption present significant challenges to the economic and stable operation of the MG. This paper investigates a multi-time model predictive control (MSMPC) strategy for the optimal scheduling of grid-connected MG. The proposed method can dynamically update the optimal scheduling of the MG on two-time scales based on real-time measurement data. The dispatchable thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs) are incorporated into the demand side management (DSM) system to enhance flexibility and satisfy the future trend of a larger proportion of controllable TCLs. Furthermore, the TCL model considers the aging problem associated with excessive compressor cycling and the satisfaction of end users. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the economic performance and robustness of the MG system. Moreover, a real-time experiment conducted using RT-LAB further verifies the feasibility of the proposed approach.</description></item><item><title>Enhanced Privacy-Preservation in Smart Grid Power Charging Coordination</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10759805</link><description>With the significant growth in the industry of energy storage units (ESUs) and plug-in electric vehicles, charging coordination becomes critical to avoid electric grid overload. However, without effective methods to secure the charging requests, malicious users can eavesdrop on the communication between the ESUs and the grid to extract sensitive users&#8217; information. Therefore, privacy preservation is a must in the design of charging coordination schemes. To address this critical issue, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving charging coordination scheme that allows the aggregator to allocate optimized amounts of charging power to all available ESUs in the community without knowing their individual charging requests details. In particular, based on aggregated secret key communication, best-effort, and cooperative power allocation schemes, the proposed coordination scheme totally hides the sensitive data from all the nodes in the network and performs the power allocation in a semi-blind fashion. Using extensive simulations, we show that our proposed scheme can achieve almost the same performance as that of charging coordination schemes in the literature based on full knowledge of the charging requests while outperforming them by an enhanced level of security. In particular, numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme can allocate 95% of what traditional schemes allocate while keeping ESU information private. Despite the anonymity and collaborative nature of the algorithm, the average convergence time is around 2.7 iterations, with 50% to 100% of cases converging in one iteration.</description></item><item><title>Production Scheduling Identification: An Inverse Optimization Approach for Industrial Load Modeling Using Smart Meter Data</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10769532</link><description>To cost-effectively manage the supply-demand balance of the power system, the flexibility of industrial users could be harnessed through demand-side response. To minimize the negative impact on the production of industrial users during demand-side response, general-purpose models such as the state-task network (STN) are widely used to model the energy-consuming constraints of industrial production processes. However, the required model parameters cannot be set because the required data are privately owned by industrial users and are not directly available, hindering the accurate modeling of industrial loads. In this paper, we propose production scheduling identification (PSI), an inverse-optimization-based approach for industrial load modeling under incomplete information. In PSI, industrial users&#8217; smart meter data are used to identify production scheduling parameters, thus addressing the problem of accurate load modeling when private data are unavailable. We implemented PSI with a modified STN and proposed a practical algorithm to obtain an effective solution. Numerical tests showed that PSI can identify the model parameters of a steel powder plant and a cement plant with acceptable accuracy, using only 21 days of hourly smart meter data. Compared with accurate models established with direct access to private data, the modeling error does not exceed 8.5% and 5.2%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Controlling Air Conditioners for Frequency Regulation: A Real-World Example</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10783092</link><description>Even though thermostatically controlled loads like air conditioners present a great potential for providing ancillary services to the electric power grid, the practical challenges associated with their real-time coordination have not received the necessary attention. In this work, we present a nondisruptive load control application, specifically, we demonstrate how real residential air conditioners can provide frequency regulation. Aggregate power adjustment is achieved by modifying the ON/OFF modes of the air conditioners. To account for both single and multi-zone houses, we extend the currently available techniques and develop an approach that can be used for controlling aggregations that include both types of houses. A discussion of the practical challenges encountered in our field experiments is provided, along with the hardware and software approaches we developed to circumvent them. We argue that limitations of current thermostat APIs introduce significant challenges and are an impediment to widespread adoption of fast load control applications.</description></item><item><title>Carbon-Aware Scheduling of Thermostatically Controlled Loads: A Bilevel DRCC Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10820107</link><description>Thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs), including air conditioners, heat pumps, water heaters, and refrigerators, play a pivotal role in demand response due to their thermal inertia and inherent flexibility. TCLs also substantially impact energy consumption and emissions within commercial and residential buildings, which makes them critical for the low-/zero-carbon transition that the building sector is undergoing to meet global climate objectives. To aid in this process, this paper proposes a carbon-aware robust scheduling approach for TCLs. The proposed approach precisely models carbon emissions attributed to TCLs, and formulates TCL scheduling as a distributionally robust chance-constrained (DRCC) optimization problem to ensure robust decision-making. We then develop a novel bilevel optimization reformulation strategy to address challenges such as over-conservatism and computational intractability that often arise from solving DRCC problems using conventional approaches. Real-world data evaluation demonstrates significant reductions in costs and carbon emissions compared to state-of-the-art methods, showcasing the effectiveness of our approach in potentially decarbonizing the building sector.</description></item><item><title>Optimizing Hydrogen Systems and Demand Response for Enhanced Integration of RES and EVs in Smart Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746543</link><description>Global interest in maximizing the hosting capacity (HC) of renewable energy sources (RES) while avoiding high energy curtailment has lately grown in smart grids (SGs). This trend has been associated with the empowerment of hydrogen systems (HS) and demand response (DR). In this regard, this article proposes a new approach to optimally synergize HS and DR for elevated integration of intermittent RES in SGs. The proposed approach is predicated on a coordinated management scheme for various SG control devices, including: a complete HS (hydrogen tank, water electrolyzer, and fuel cell), hydrogen load DR, RES energy curtailment, DSTATCOM functionality of the RES inverters, storage charging rates, and electrical DR. Additionally, the flexibility of electric vehicles (EVs) with G2V/V2G functionalities has been considered to support RES and HS expansion. The proposed approach is formulated as a multi-objective optimization model that aims to optimize two competing objective functions, i.e., total costs and HC capacity of RESs. The simulation results reveal the superiority of the proposed approach which resulted in a notable HC increase of up to 17.24%, accompanied by a significant cost reduction. The proposed approach is also applied to define the optimal number of HS to maximize RES capacity.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Coordinated Automatic Generation Control Involving Distributed Energy Resources: An Aggregation Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746554</link><description>The distributed energy resources (DERs) need to provide ancillary services due to their increasing penetration level in distribution networks (DNs). This paper proposes a hierarchically coordinated automatic generation control (AGC) scheme for the multi-level power grids, to facilitate the DERs to provide AGC service, while ensuring the operational security of the host DNs. Each DN is formulated as an individual AGC participating entity to reduce the computational and communication burden of the transmission system operator (TSO). The distribution system operator (DSO) aggregates its managed DER clusters as a whole, and evaluates the equivalent aggregation dynamic model as well as the regulation capacity. The regulation capacity is evaluated using an optimization program that consider device and network constraints, and prediction uncertainties. The aggregation dynamic model is estimated based on the curve-fitting, which represents the external power response characteristics of the DN as a second-order state-space model. In addition, P-Q affine regulation strategy is employed to coordinate frequency and voltage control. The active and reactive power commands are simultaneously allocated to DER clusters to eliminate voltage violations arising from providing AGC services. Case studies conducted on a multi-level power grid verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Attack-Resilient Distributed Fixed-Time Consensus Control for HBESSs and Circuit Implementation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772734</link><description>This paper investigates the consensus control problem for heterogeneous battery energy storage systems (HBESSs) with switching topologies. An attack-resilient distributed control scheme is proposed to realize active/reactive power sharing, energy level balancing and frequency/voltage restoration within fixed-time. Rigorous proofs derive the convergence time upper bound for each objective, which is independent on the HBESSs&#8217; initial states and tighter than previous bounds. It is also shown that under bounded actuator attacks, above three control objectives can still be realized in fixed-time. Moreover, analog circuits are firstly constructed to physically implement this new control strategy, which provides a new insight to deploy advanced control schemes on HBESSs. Several simulation examples validate those conclusions from both numerical and circuital perspectives.</description></item><item><title>Near-Optimal Energy Management Strategy for a Grid-Forming PV and Hybrid Energy Storage System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771975</link><description>Integration of Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors (SCs) into PV plants enables a hybrid PV system with more grid functions like power filtering and frequency regulation. Above that, an energy management system (EMS) plays a key role in achieving grid functions and economic performance. However, previous efforts focused on advanced forecast methods without considering real-time EMS. This paper thus aims to develop a practical real-time EMS with near-optimal performance for the degradation of the hybrid energy storage system (HESS). Firstly, a variational mode decomposition (VMD) method is combined with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to decompose and learn feature parameters of typical historical weather data, improving forecast accuracy and shifting the operation mode periodically. Then, the mixed integer linear programming approach is utilized to find out the optimal control mode in different operation scenarios, and three-segment rules are extracted from the optimization results. Finally, the deep learning-based real-time EMS is developed. Numeric simulations validate that the proposed EMS can achieve near-optimal performance with a low computation burden. Besides, the proposed strategy can reduce the degradation cost by up to 80% compared with competitive rule-based strategies.</description></item><item><title>A Multi-Area Architecture for Real-Time Feedback-Based Optimization of Distribution Grids</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819497</link><description>A challenge in transmission-distribution coordination is how to quickly and reliably coordinate Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) across large multi-stakeholder Distribution Networks (DNs) to support the Transmission Network (TN), while ensuring operational constraints continue to be met within the DN. Here we propose a hierarchical feedback-based control architecture for coordination of DERs in DNs, enabling the DN to quickly respond to power set-point requests from the Transmission System Operator (TSO) while maintaining local DN constraints. Our scheme allows for multiple independently-managed areas within the DN to optimize their local resources while coordinating to support the TN, and while maintaining data privacy; the only required inter-area communication is between physically adjacent areas within the DN control hierarchy. We conduct a rigorous stability analysis, establishing intuitive conditions for closed-loop stability, and provide detailed tuning recommendations. The proposal is validated via case studies on multiple feeders, including IEEE-123 and IEEE-8500, using a custom MATLAB&#174;-based application which integrates with OpenDSS&#169;. The simulation results show that the proposed structure is highly scalable and can quickly coordinate DERs in response to TSO commands, while responding to local disturbances within the DN and maintaining DN operational limits.</description></item><item><title>Lyapunov Method-Based Coherent Aggregation of Grid-Forming Converters for Transient Stability Equivalents</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819501</link><description>Paralleled grid-forming converters (GFMs) system suffers from transient instability issues while accurate model is complicated and unsuitable to give stability analysis. Existing aggregation method requires either extensive computation or linearized model assumption to realize coherent identification, which might not distinguish unstable units from stable clusters. In this paper, a two-step algorithm is proposed to realize coherent recognition for multi-GFMs system based on Lyapunov energy function: 1) unstable GFMs are distinguished from stable clusters based on Lyapunov&#8217;s function, 2) stable GFMs are further divided into different clusters using stored potential energy as a criterion. First, large-signal model considering transient interactions and virtual impedance-based fault ride through (VI-FRT) control is derived in transient stability time-scale. Then, Lyapunov energy function (LEF) is constructed for multi-GFMs system taking virtual damping coefficients and voltage dynamics into account. Compared with existing methods, the constructed LEF presents higher stability prediction accuracy and lower computational burden. Moreover, it is found that the relative potential energy among different GFMs can be adopted to identify coherent clusters, which is proved to be mathematically equivalent to coherency recognition using power angle deviation as the indicator. Finally, parameters aggregation is realized using the concept of center of inertia (COI). Based on the proposed method, equivalent reduced model has good accuracy in transient stability prediction compared with full-order model. Both numerical simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experiments are provided to validate the feasibility of the proposed method.</description></item><item><title>Equitable Active-Reactive Power Envelopes for Distributed Energy Resources in Power Distribution Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829662</link><description>The operating envelope (OE) provides an effective method to manage distributed energy resources (DERs) in power distribution systems (DSs) by offering allowable regions of nodal power injections. The active-reactive power envelope (P-Q envelope) is a desirable type of OE that would increase the allowable active power range and release the reactive power flexibility. However, existing OE studies have not established P-Q envelopes with guaranteed equitableness. This paper proposes an equitable P-Q envelope calculation and optimization method. First, we model the P-Q envelopes as convex polygons on active-reactive power planes of nodal power injections. Second, we define the proportional equitableness of P-Q envelopes and establish two equitable conditions, under which the equitableness of P-Q envelopes is proved mathematically. Third, we propose the P-Q envelope calculation method. Specifically, the P-Q envelopes are initially established considering the security constraints of DSs and then modified by a geometric method to satisfy two equitable conditions. Finally, we develop the optimization method to increase the maximum active power export and import provided by P-Q envelopes by coordinating the on-load tap changer, capacitor banks, and distributed generators. The proposed methods are tested on the 33-bus, real-world 135-bus and 455-bus DSs. Numerical results show that the proposed method efficiently obtains the P-Q envelopes with strict proportional equitableness and remarkably enlarges the size of P-Q envelopes by optimizing the control strategies of DS devices. Compared with existing OE calculation methods, the proposed method obtains the largest allowable power range using the shortest computation time.</description></item><item><title>Coordination of Multi-Agent Orderly Charging via an Incentive-Compatible Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750297</link><description>As the cyber-physical system is developed into cyber-physical-social system, the importance of social factors is growing in the interaction between electric vehicle (EV) and power system. This paper aims to develop an incentive-compatible mechanism to coordinate multi-agent orderly charging. Firstly, the travel behaviors of EV cluster are simulated based on Monte Carlo sampling, and the load transfer model considering various social factors is constructed. Then, an orderly charging mechanism involving multiple agents based on Nash bargaining theory is proposed. In the first stage, the total profit of electric vehicle user, power grid company (PGC), and charge station operator is maximized. In the second stage, the revenue of each agent after participating in the cooperation is improved by transfer payment. Next, the carbon trading mechanism is applied in the incentive compatibility model, and the revenue of PGC participating in the carbon market under different scenarios and constraints are calculated. Finally, by comparing with the existing model, the simulation results show that the proposed multi-agent coordinated orderly charging model can reduce the pressure on the power grid caused by the randomness of EV travel, and through a fair profit distribution mechanism, it can maximize the social benefits of the coalition while increasing the revenue of each agent.</description></item><item><title>Joint Energy-Computation Management for Electric Vehicles Under Coordination of Power Distribution Networks and Computing Power Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753461</link><description>This paper explores the integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into the power distribution network (PDN) and computing power network (CPN), leveraging EVs&#8217; inherent energy storage and computing resources. A conceptual hub called a charging and computing station (CCS) is introduced, enabling parked EVs to interact with the PDN and CPN simultaneously. The CPN is composed of the EVs and edge servers, whose computing resources are collectively utilized for processing computation tasks from various applications. The EVs and edge servers in CCSs consume energy at different nodes of the PDN. A two-stage framework is proposed for joint energy and computation management in the EV-PDN-CPN coordination. In Stage 1, a day-ahead system cost minimization problem is formulated with decisions on EV charging/discharging energy scheduling and computation task reallocation among edge servers. A fast algorithm based on the convex-concave procedure is developed to solve the Stage-1 problem whose nonconvexity stems from network constraints of both the PDN and CPN. In Stage 2, EV computing resources are utilized to achieve real-time task offloading, coping with the prediction errors of computation tasks in Stage 1 and minimizing the use of extra energy and computing resources. A linear search algorithm is proposed to solve the nonconvex Stage-2 problem. Results show that the proposed algorithms are more computationally efficient than off-the-shelf solvers, and the proposed EV-PDN-CPN coordination model can save 4.7% and 91.9% of costs in the two stages, respectively, compared to uncoordinated models.</description></item><item><title>Consensus Algorithm-Based Two-Stage Frequency Regulation Strategy With EVs Participating as VSMs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771824</link><description>Isolated grids, with large-scale intermittent renewable energy sources (RESs), face more severe frequency stability issues. Fortunately, grid-connected electric vehicles (EVs) present an opportunity to provide frequency services. In this paper, a two-stage frequency regulation strategy, in which EVs participate in the form of a virtual synchronous machine (VSM), is proposed. First, a frequency response (FR) model is established for both charging stations (CSs) and battery swapping stations (BSSs) using VSM control. On this basis, a two-stage strategy is proposed to consider both frequency regulation performance and system economy. Specifically, in the day-ahead stage (DAS), a multi-unit economic dispatch (ED) model is designed to formulate the operation plan; in the real-time stage (RTS), a consensus-based power allocation strategy is designed for multi-units, responsive to real-time market prices. Case studies involving real-world data of load, RES, and CS illustrate the key benefits of the proposed method, including (i) decreasing frequency deviation, (ii) providing extra rotational inertia, and (iii) reducing dispatch costs.</description></item><item><title>Grid-Aware Scheduling and Control of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations for Dispatching Active Distribution Networks: Theory and Experimental Validation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829625</link><description>This paper proposes and experimentally validates a grid-aware scheduling and control framework for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCSs) for dispatching the operation of active distribution networks (ADNs). The framework consists of two stages. In the first stage (day-ahead), we determine an optimal 24-hour power schedule at the grid connection point (GCP), referred to as the dispatch plan. Then, in the second stage, a real-time model predictive control (RT-MPC) is proposed to track the day-ahead dispatch plan using flexibility from EVCSs and other controllable resources (e.g., batteries). The dispatch plan accounts for the uncertainties of vehicles connected to the EVCS along with other uncontrollable power injections, by day-ahead predicted scenarios. The RT-MPC accounts for the uncertainty of the power injections of stochastic resources (such as demand and generation from photovoltaic &#8211; PV plants) by short-term forecasts. The framework ensures that the grid is operated within its nodal voltage and branches power-flow operational bounds, modeled by a linearized optimal power-flow model, maintaining the tractability of the problem formulation. The scheme is numerically and experimentally validated on a real-life ADN at the EPFL hosting two controllable EVCSs (172 kWp and 32 kWp), multiple PV plants (aggregated generation of 42 kWp), uncontrollable demand from office buildings (20 kWp), and two controllable BESSs (150kW/300kWh and 25kW/25kWh).</description></item><item><title>Peer-to-Peer Multi-Energy Trading Among Heterogeneous Building Prosumers via Asynchronous Distributed Algorithm</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10877846</link><description>Smart buildings in the integrated community energy system (ICES) are normally equipped with distributed energy resources (DERs), thereby creating building prosumers with both energy production and consumption. Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading among building prosumers can bring higher economic benefits for them. Therefore, a P2P multi-energy trading scheme among building prosumers is proposed, which fully explores the flexibility of buildings&#8217; heating loads based on the thermal dynamics of buildings with different thermal insulation properties. Each building prosumer is heterogeneous in terms of its computation and communication infrastructures. This results in a heavy computation burden with the traditional centralized method. To improve the computational efficiency for P2P trading among heterogeneous building prosumers, an asynchronous distributed algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is developed to enable each prosumer to trade energy asynchronously instead of waiting for the trading information from others with poor infrastructure. This asynchronous procedure integrated with the prediction and anomaly detection steps can further accelerate the convergence speed of P2P trading. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed trading scheme and the feasibility and solution optimality of the proposed algorithm.</description></item><item><title>A Joint Power and Renewable Energy Certificate Trading Method in the Peer-to-Peer Market</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777014</link><description>A novel peer-to-peer joint power &amp; renewable energy certificate trading method is proposed to reflect the power &amp; environment values of renewable power simultaneously, as well as promote the on-site utilization.

Various control methods have been previously proposed to manage and control LCC-HVDC systems, but none have provided a multi-level control system capable of operating in multiple areas simultaneously. This article presents a comprehensive and multi-task control system for wide-area HVDC systems. In the proposed control systems, multi-level frequency control is conducted in multi-area LCC-HVDC interconnected grids. Additionally, various control strategies are implemented to enhance the network&#8217;s resilience during three-phase fault conditions. Furthermore, the proposed control system can detect and distinguish intelligent false data injection (FDI) cyber-attacks. Nonlinear time domain simulations conducted in MATLAB/SIMULINK demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively balance the frequency of weaker areas, enhance network resilience in critical conditions, and identify FDI cyber-attacks.</description></item><item><title>Detection-Triggered Recursive Impact Mitigation Against Secondary False Data Injection Attacks in Cyber-Physical Microgrid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746504</link><description>The cybersecurity of microgrid has received widespread attentions due to the frequently reported attack accidents against distributed energy resource (DER) manufactures. Numerous impact mitigation schemes have been proposed to reduce or eliminate the impacts of false data injection attacks (FDIAs). Nevertheless, the existing methods either requires at least one neighboring trustworthy agent or may bring in unacceptable cost burdens. This paper aims to propose a detection-triggered recursive impact mitigation scheme that can timely and precisely counter the secondary FDIAs (SFDIAs) against the communication links among DERs. Once triggering attack alarms, the power line current readings will be utilised to observe the voltage bias injections through the physical interconnections among DERs, based on which the current bias injections can be recursively reconstructed from the residuals generated by unknown input observers (UIOs). The attack impacts are eliminated by subtracting the reconstructed bias from the incoming compromised data. The proposed mitigation method can work even in the worst case where all communication links are under SFDIAs and only require extra current sensors. The bias reconstruction performance under initial errors and system noises is theoretically analysed and the reconstruction error is proved to be bounded regardless of the electrical parameters. To avoid deploying current sensors on all power lines, a cost-effective deployment strategy is presented to secure a spanning tree set of communication links that can guarantee the secondary control performance. Extensive validation studies are conducted in MATLAB/Simulink and cyber-physical microgrid testbeds to validate the proposed method&#8217;s effectiveness against single/multiple and continuous/discrete SFDIAs.</description></item><item><title>Consecutive Load Redistribution Attack Without Line Admittance Information</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10756615</link><description>This paper develops a novel method for launching a stealthy Load Redistribution Attack (LRA) without requiring knowledge of the power network&#8217;s admittance matrix. Initially, equations involving the admittance matrix in the conventional LRA model are substituted with equivalent conditions utilizing the Power Transfer Distribution Factor (PTDF) matrix. Subsequently, a ridge regression approach is applied to estimate the PTDF matrix based on the hijacked Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data. To maximize the damage inflicted by the proposed LRA, a consecutively small-scale attack strategy is designed to gather more informative data, and the PTDF matrix estimation is then updated accordingly to enhance its accuracy. Ultimately, a stealthy LRA is completed using the final PTDF matrix estimation. The rationale behind employing the PTDF matrix estimation in the proposed method, as opposed to the estimation of the admittance matrix, is that the latter requires information on bus voltage phase angles not supplied by the SCADA system. Simulations on the IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 118-bus system, without admittance information for grid transmission lines, demonstrate the accuracy and efficacy of the proposed attack.</description></item><item><title>Infinitesimal-Attack-High-Impact Phenomena: Cyber-Attack Bifurcation in Two-Terminal HVDC Power Delivery Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772379</link><description>Voltage-source converters (VSC) and current-source converters (CSC) are two predominant techniques in high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) power delivery systems. They are crucial for inter-regional power exchange. The cyber vulnerabilities of HVDC systems have been physically demonstrated, threatening their secure operation. To this end, this study investigates the closed-form bifurcation hyperplanes in the cyber-attack injection space of both the VSC HVDC system and the CSC HVDC system. By considering the inherent nonlinearity in intra-station switching control and inter-station coordination control, this study formulates different clusters of attack-induced equilibrium points in HVDC systems. Closed-form sufficient conditions are then derived for triggering small-attack-high-impact and even infinitesimal-attack-high-impact phenomena, in which an infinitesimal cyber-attack can activate rapid power reversal by altering the DC current polarity in VSC HVDC systems or DC voltage polarity in CSC HVDC systems. These attack-induced properties are experimentally validated by establishing a hardware-in-the-loop HVDC cybersecurity testbed, incorporating a Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) and a STM32F429-based cyber-attack prototype.

Such real-time data may inadvertently disclose the identities and activities of power users. Data aggregation has been identified as a viable solution to this challenge, enabling data centers to obtain only the aggregate power consumption data without accessing individual user information. However, most existing aggregation methodologies are limited to multi-dimensional data aggregation and fail to ensure user privacy, data integrity, and authentication. In this study, we propose a ring signature based multi-dimensional and multi-subset aggregation (LPPMM-DA) scheme. This proposed method allows the data center to compute both the total power consumption and the number of users within each subset across various dimensions. Based on the hardness assumption of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP), the ring signature utilized in our scheme is demonstrably unforgeable against adaptive chosen message attacks within the random oracle model. A comprehensive analysis indicates that the proposed scheme meets the security requirements for data aggregation in the smart grid context. Furthermore, performance evaluations reveal that the implementation of this scheme results in lower computational and communication overhead compared to existing related approaches.</description></item><item><title>Securing FACTS-Based Wide Area Damping Controllers Using Modified Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10772252</link><description>The performance of wide-area damping controllers (WADCs) heavily depends on the accuracy and authenticity of the measurements received from phasor measurement units (PMUs). These controllers receive PMU data and send the control commands back to grid actuators, e.g., flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS) devices. The use of cyber systems required for transferring PMU measurements, however, makes the controller and entire power system prone to a variety of cyber attacks, e.g., false data injection attacks (FDIAs). On this basis, this paper (i) proposes an FDIA model against FACTS-based WADCs and (ii) develops detection and mitigation methods for the proposed attacks. First, FDIAs are designed to destabilize the system, considering realistic limitations on the power grids. Then, a modified conditional generative adversarial network (MCGAN) is utilized for the detection and mitigation of these FDIAs. To detect this attack, a detector is developed from the discriminator of MCGAN, using the fine-tuning technique. The use of this proposed method enhances detection performance in imbalanced datasets and effectively identifies unseen high-risk attacks. Following the detection, a mitigation method is implemented based on the coordination of a graph-based interpolation and the tuned generator of the developed MCGAN. This method effectively mitigates the impact of the FDIAs on the FACTS-based WADCs. The effectiveness of the attack model, as well as the detection and mitigation methods, is assessed using the two-area Kundur and New England 39-Bus test systems.</description></item><item><title>Power Distribution Network Topology Detection Using Dual-Graph Structure Graph Neural Network Model</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10779459</link><description>Topology detection (TD) in the context of power distribution networks (PDNs) is a fundamental requirement for a wide range of applications, such as fault localization and load management. PDNs suffer from a lack of real-time topological information due to insufficient data on switch statuses and an increasing number of switching actions caused by reconfigurations and the control of distributed energy resources (DERs). On this basis, in this paper, a novel near real-time TD method for PDNs is proposed. This method is built on a specialized graph neural network (GNN) design using data from micro-phasor measurement units ( $\mu $ PMUs), leveraging the strengths of both graph-based learning and conventional deep learning (DL) approaches. More specifically, the developed TD method implements a novel dual-graph structure GNN (DGS-GNN) model to transform the TD problem into an inductive link prediction task for a multi-graph dataset. During the training phase, a node attribute similarity graph is created, and the resulting node embeddings are aligned with the actual topology graph (ATG) using a structure-aware loss function. In the inference phase, however, unlike standard GNN models that require structural information as input, the ATG is recovered based solely on node attributes. The developed method enables TD using a limited number of phasor measurements with low inference time and superior generalization capability for unseen scenarios. Its strong performance in large-scale PDNs with varying configurations, as well as its robustness to uncertainties from DERs and noisy environments, is demonstrated on the IEEE 33- and 123-Bus benchmarks and a standard 240-Bus test system. The proposed method outperforms its DL-based counterparts in scenarios where full or partial system topology should be detected.</description></item><item><title>Detection of FDIA in Power Grid Based on Hypergraph and Attention Mechanism</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10819489</link><description>False data injection attack (FDIA) is posing a threat to the security of power grids. Detection technology is an effective means to defend against FDIA, but the existing mainstream methods have insufficient detection capabilities for large-scale power grids. This study proposes a novel method that combines subgraph partitioning strategy and hypergraph model to detect FDIA. According to the principle the attack principle, the power grid is partitioned into subgraphs. Each subgraph is constructed as the hypergraph and then input into the hypergraph convolutional neural network (HGCNN). The hypergraph attention mechanism (HGAT) is adopted to pay attention to the hyperedge, where the attention score is calculated through the similarity between the node and the hyperedge. Simulations were conducted on IEEE 14-, 118-, and 300-bus systems. At the 10% attack intensity, the proposed method achieved 1.62%, 2.05%, and 2.18% higher accuracy than the optimal results of the comparison methods on three test systems, respectively.</description></item><item><title>Fostering Trust in Smart Inverters: A Framework for Firmware Update Management and Tracking in VPP Context</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829643</link><description>Ensuring the reliability and security of smart inverters that provide the interface between distributed energy resources (DERs) and the power grid becomes paramount with the surge in integrating DERs into the (smart) power grid. Despite the importance of having updated firmware/software versions within a reasonable time frame, existing methods for establishing trust through firmware updates lack effective historical tracking and verification. This paper introduces a novel framework to manage and track firmware update history, leveraging verifiable credentials. By tracking the update history and implementing a trust cycle based on these verifiable updates, we aim to improve grid resilience, enhance cybersecurity, and increase transparency for stakeholders.</description></item><item><title>Toward Value-Oriented Renewable Energy Forecasting: An Iterative Learning Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10771620</link><description>Energy forecasting is an essential task in power system operations. Operators usually issue forecasts and use them to schedule energy dispatch in advance. However, forecasting models are typically developed in a way that overlooks the decision value of forecasts. To bridge the gap, we design a value-oriented point forecasting approach for sequential energy dispatch problems with renewable energy sources. At the training phase, we align the training objective with the decision value, i.e., minimizing the overall operating cost. The forecasting model parameter estimation is formulated as a bilevel program. Under mild assumptions, we convert the upper-level objective into an equivalent form using the dual solutions obtained from the lower-level operation problems. In addition, a novel iterative solution strategy is proposed for the newly formulated bilevel program. Under such an iterative scheme, we show that the upper-level objective is locally linear with respect to the forecasting model output and can act as the loss function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared to commonly used forecasts predicting expected realization, forecasts obtained by the proposed approach result in lower operating costs. Meanwhile, the proposed approach achieves performance comparable to that of two-stage stochastic programs, but is more computationally efficient.</description></item><item><title>On the Solution Uniqueness of Data-Driven Modeling of Flexible Loads</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10803001</link><description>This letter first explores the solution uniqueness of the data-driven modeling of price-responsive flexible loads (PFL). The PFL on the demand side is critical in modern power systems. An accurate PFL model is fundamental for system operations. However, whether the PFL model can be uniquely and correctly identified from operational data remains unclear. To address this, we analyze the structural and practical identifiability of the PFL model, deriving the dataset condition that guarantees the solution uniqueness. Besides, we point out the practical implications of the results. Numerical tests validate this work.</description></item><item><title>Energy Management System Based on S-Shaped Functions for Series Hybrid Vehicle Under a Fully Active Topology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753086</link><description>This paper proposes an energy management system (EMS) applied to a series hybrid vehicle (SHV) powered by an internal combustion engine (ICE) and a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) consisting of chemical batteries and supercapacitors. The EMS enables power sharing among the ICE and the HESS under a fully active topology to improve control flexibility, considering that the ICE-generator set and HESS efficiencies are limited to a specific power injection operating range and transient responses. In this context, power sharing is performed using S-shaped functions that focus on maximizing supercapacitor usability to reduce fuel consumption and battery current stress. The advantage of the S-shaped function lies on its easy configuration and reduced number of control parameters. Additionally, meta-heuristic optimization is used to tune the S-shaped functions according to the sources requirements for optimal performance in standard driving cycles, while Lyapunov&#8217;s indirect method performs the stability analysis of the control strategy. Finally, experimental and computational simulations are accomplished to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed EMS compared with traditional methods and an optimal approach.</description></item><item><title>Predictive Beamforming in Integrated Sensing and Communication-Enabled Vehicular Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753082</link><description>Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has recently attracted significant research attention. This paper develops the deep learning-based predictive beamforming method for the ISAC-enabled vehicular networks. Traditional deep learning (DL) is a data-driven approach, which means that numerous training samples are required to improve system performance. In addition, embedded devices are not able to provide sufficient computing power, which hinders the application of DL solutions. Motivated by this, the dynamic self-attention mechanism is proposed to reduce the dependence of DL on training samples. Aiming for the optimal trade-off between sensing performance and computational complexity, the efficient model design, Self-Attention Channel Shuffle Mobile Network (SACSMN), is formulated. Experimental results demonstrate that SACSMN achieves similar sensing performance to that based on the full training set under the condition of few samples, the dependence of SACSMN on training samples is significantly reduced. Furthermore, SACSMN significantly reduces the computational complexity while achieving the same level of sensing performance as the benchmarks, realizing the optimal trade-off between system sensing performance and computational complexity. Benefiting from the robust sensing performance of SACSMN, the system achieves the same level of communication performance as that based on full training samples in the case of few samples.</description></item><item><title>OFDM-Based Waveform Design for MIMO DFRC Systems With Reduced Range Sidelobes: A Majorization-Minimization Approach</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753570</link><description>This paper focuses on waveform design for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) systems, particularly tailored for environments with multiple single-antenna downlink user equipments (UEs). Our approach leverages orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology to address the challenges of frequency-selective fading. To mitigate the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) issues inherent in OFDM signals, the desired low-PAPR property is also incorporated into the design of the waveforms. For enhanced radar sensing functionality, we introduce an advanced metric, the weighted peak or integrated sidelobe level (WPISL), meticulously crafted to measure and minimize low-range sidelobes. On the communication front, we integrate constructive interference (CI) techniques to significantly enhance quality of service (QoS) in data transmission. To address the intricate optimization challenges presented by our design objectives, we have developed an efficient algorithm anchored in the majorization-minimization (MM) framework. The numerical experiments demonstrate that this algorithm notably surpasses existing state-of-the-art benchmarks in reducing range sidelobe interference. Furthermore, our CI-based approach yields enhanced performance compared to traditional least squares (LS) methods, achieving lower symbol error rates (SER) and higher average achievable sum rates.</description></item><item><title>On the Capacity Region of Optical Mobile Communication Systems With Spatial Light Modulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753637</link><description>Optical Mobile Communication (OMC) is a newly raised optical wireless communication system, where a novel device called Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) is applied. With the deploying of SLM units, OMC systems can split one light beam to multiple beams directing to different receivers, and hence bring in a new design freedom on the energy allocation for each sub-beam. In this paper, we study a general model of the OMC systems that the transmitter wants to broadcast multiple messages to multiple users, and some of the users may request a same message. We focus on characterizing the capacity region of such OMC systems, in order to assess the benefits on capacity by deploying SLM units. For the general cases, numerical solutions of the capacity region are raised, and for special cases that the system is symmetric or the signal to noise ratio (SNR) is rather low, closed form results of the capacity region are proposed. We also study the OMC system which broadcasts two different messages, and give out a partial closed form result of the capacity region. From this case, we can find that characterizing the capacity region for OMC systems is equivalent to optimizing high order polynomial, which is doable but impossible to find closed form results in general. Key words: Optical Mobile Communication, Spatial Light Modulator, capacity region.</description></item><item><title>Deep Learning Based Energy-Efficient Hybird RSMA for UAV-Assisted mmWave Communications</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10759308</link><description>This paper investigates hybrid rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication network (RSMA-UAV-MMWCN), where a UAV transmits messages to multiple ground user equipment under the influence of an external jammer. We formulate a non-convex joint optimization problem involving hybrid RSMA matrices and a common rate allocation vector, with the objective of maximizing energy efficiency while approaching the performance of ideal hybrid RSMA. Departing from traditional non-convex problem-solving methods, we introduce a hybrid RSMA optimization scheme based on deep residual networks to enhance the feasibility of hybrid precoding and decoding. Initially, due to the absence of standardized and universal datasets, we propose a dataset generation algorithm to create training and testing datasets for subsequent communication model training. Subsequently, we construct a loss function that integrates the objective function with the constraints of the optimization problem. Lastly, to ensure that the optimization variables strictly comply with the constraints, we design a mandatory constraint module comprising modulus, power, and rate constraint sub-modules. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm surpasses traditional optimization methods, and RSMA shows significant advantages over conventional multiple access (MA) schemes.</description></item><item><title>Latency Minimization for MEC-V2X Assisted Autonomous Vehicles Task Offloading</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752420</link><description>Delay-sensitive applications for autonomous vehicles (AVs) require a substantial amount of computational resources. However, the onboard computation resources may be insufficient, resulting in long processing latencies. To deal with this critical issue, we jointly consider roadside unit (RSU) and assistant vehicle offloading, along with resource allocation, to minimize latency for vehicular tasks. This approach also takes into account frequency reuse among sub-areas for assistant vehicle offloading. The latency minimization problem can be formulated as a mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem. Given the inherent complexity of the MINLP problem, we propose a two-step solution. The first step focuses on the combined decision of assistant vehicle offloading and transmit power allocation. To solve this problem, we propose a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm with low complexity and low average transmit power. The second step deals with RSU offloading/local computation decision, bandwidth allocation, and computation resource allocation. An iterative algorithm is proposed to achieve the optimal solution. Without adding additional computation resources, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed vehicular task offloading approach improves overall delay performance than the adaptive MEC offloading scheme and the pure MEC computing scheme.</description></item><item><title>Adaptive Prioritization and Task Offloading in Vehicular Edge Computing Through Deep Reinforcement Learning</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10755183</link><description>Vehicular edge computing enables real-time decision-making by offloading vehicular computation tasks to edge servers along roadways. This paper focuses on optimizing offloading and scheduling these tasks, with an emphasis on task prioritization to maximize task completion within deadlines while minimizing latency and energy consumption across all priority levels. We propose a prioritized Deep Q-Network (DQNP) that optimizes long-term rewards through a priority-scaled reward system for each priority level, guiding the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent to select optimal actions. The model dynamically adjusts task selection based on environmental conditions, such as prioritizing tasks with higher deadlines in poor channel states, ensuring balanced and efficient offloading across all priority levels. Simulation results demonstrate that DQNP outperforms existing baseline algorithms, increasing task completion by 14%, particularly for high-priority tasks, while reducing energy consumption by 8% and maintaining similar latency. Additionally, the model mitigates resource starvation for lower-priority tasks, achieving task selection rates of 27%, 32%, and 42% for low-, medium-, and high-priority tasks, with completion ratios of 88%, 87%, and 86%, respectively, reflecting balanced resource allocation across priority classes.</description></item><item><title>Covert Beamforming Design for Cooperative NOMA-Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10752409</link><description>In this paper, we consider covert communication in a cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where the ISAC relay can communicate with the covert user under the cover of probing waveforms and public communication waveforms without detection by the warden. For the proposed scheme, a closed-form expression for the minimum average detection error probability of warden is derived, where the detection threshold can be dynamically adjusted by the warden. Besides, we jointly design the covert transmission beamforming, target beamforming, and public transmission beamforming for maximizing the covert rate, subject to satisfying the successive interference cancellation decoding order, the quality of service requirement constraint at the public user, the sensing constraint, the covert constraint, and the total transimt power constraint. The sub-optimal solutions can be derived by employing semidefinite relaxation and the Charnes-Cooper transformation, which are provided to solve the proposed non-convex covert rate maximization problem. Simulation results demostrate that the covert rate of the proposed scheme can be effectively enhanced, compared to the ISAC systems assisted by orthogonal multiple access.</description></item><item><title>Design of STAR-RIS Assisted Uplink NOMA for Maximum Fairness</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10753571</link><description>To support massive connectivity with full service coverage, this paper integrates a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) into uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). In particular, the energy splitting (ES) protocol of STAR-RIS is considered, leading to two types of NOMA: ES/NOMA, which simultaneously supports all users in the transmitting and reflecting spaces of the STAR-RIS and ES/hybrid NOMA (H-NOMA), which supports multiple ES/NOMA pairs in time division multiple access (TDMA). To maximize rate fairness, we develop STAR-RIS beamforming and resource allocation algorithms for ES/NOMA and ES/H-NOMA, along with a globally optimal solution and a closed-form solution for two-user ES/NOMA. The proposed ES/NOMA algorithm achieves faster computation than conventional alternating optimization. The proposed ES/H-NOMA algorithm significantly reduces the complexity of ES/NOMA by using a closed-form solution for two-user ES/NOMA and designing a faster user assignment algorithm with optimal time allocation. The simulation results validate the algorithms and analysis for ES/NOMA and ES/H-NOMA and demonstrate their superiority over the time-switching NOMA and TDMA protocols.</description></item><item><title>Joint Beamforming and Power Allocation Design for Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10756670</link><description>Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) is considered a revolutionary technology that enables powerful signal processing directly in the electromagnetic (EM) wave domain and has significant energy-saving advantages. In this work, we explore the performance of a SIM-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system that incorporates joint beamforming and power allocation. Specifically, we jointly design the transmit power allocation at access points (APs) and the wave-based beamforming at SIMs for maximizing the system sum rate. An alternating optimization (AO)-based iterative algorithm is proposed for solving the complex non-convex problem, which is decomposed into two subproblems. For the transmit power allocation subproblem, maximum ratio transmission (MRT) is employed to maximize signal receiving power. For the optimization subproblem of SIM phase shifts, a proficient gradient ascent algorithm is deployed to ensure convergence to a local optimum. Simulation results show an enhancement in the performance of the proposed AO algorithm compared to baseline methods. Additionally, numerical results contrast with those of RIS-aided CF-mMIMO systems, highlighting the advantages of SIMs in CF networks and demonstrating the efficacy of SIM-enabled wave-based beamforming design, where increasing the number of meta-atoms and layers of SIMs is beneficial for improving the sum rate.</description></item><item><title>User Selection With Effective Channel Quality Feedback for PMI-Based MU-MIMO</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10755985</link><description>This paper addresses user selection for precoding matrix indicator (PMI)-based multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. Under a scenario where channel information can only be obtained through PMI, we formulate a problem to find a user set that maximizes the sum-rate of MU-MIMO with maximum ratio transmission precoding. We then analyze that the user set can be determined by solely considering the effective signal power, which is achieved by the convergence of the sum of interference as the numbers of users and antennas go to infinity. Based on the analysis, we propose a user selection algorithm that utilizes the effective signal power. To this end, we introduce feedback of the effective channel quality representing the effective signal power, which is then employed in choosing users. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed user selection algorithm outperforms existing methods.</description></item><item><title>Optimal AAV 3D Trajectory Design and Resource Allocation for Secure Mobile Edge Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10755161</link><description>In this paper, we consider a secure mobile edge computing (MEC) in both uplink and downlink communication with the help of autonomous aerial vehicle (AAV), whereby offloading for terrestrial users (TUs) is performed at AAV equipped with an MEC server by secure communication between multiple TUs and AAV in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers (Eves). In order to establish a secure communication link, we propose the joint optimal design of 3D AAV trajectory and resource allocation with the aim of minimizing total user energy consumption (UEC) under the AAV constraints including the limited energy budget, computation resources, and mobility. Especially, for 3D AAV trajectory, Rician fading is considered by including the vertical domain of AAV leading to higher AAV flight freedom. To tackle the optimization problem, the proposed algorithmic solutions leverage iterative algorithms for AAV trajectory, offloading data, and both uplink and downlink transmit power. Via numerical results, it is shown that the proposed joint design significantly outperforms the conventional scheme with a separate design.</description></item><item><title>Global Progress Toward Renewable Electricity: Tracking the Role of Solar (Version 4)</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10673798</link><description>Photovoltaics (PV) represented &#8764;61% of newly installed global electricity generating capacity for 2023.

Despite targets to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, fossil fuels still dominate the energy industry systems in the USA and Canada. Transition pathways are developed and analyzed comparing a complete defossilization of both energy and nonenergy demands with business-as-usual conditions based on government projections. The results demonstrate the benefits of transitioning to 100% renewable energy for all sectors, as excess low-cost electricity from solar PV can be used for power-to-X solutions to produce electricity-based fuels, chemicals, and materials. By 2050, the power sector will only consume 20% of generated electricity, with the remaining used to electrify the heat, transport, and industry sectors. Thus, 86% of all primary energy in the system comes from renewable electricity, as total electricity generation increases from 4394 TWh in 2020 to 20 795 TWh in 2050. Solar PV reaches 78% of all electricity generation, leading to 10.6 TW of installed capacity. The full energy industry sector transition leads to reductions in both levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and levelized cost of final energy (LCOFE). The LCOE sees massive reductions from 72 &#8364;/MWh in 2020 to 25 &#8364;/MWh in 2050, and the LCOFE decreases from the current 50 to 41 &#8364;/MWh in 2050. The strong operational synergies between solar PV and flexible electrolysis enable a transition pathway that demonstrates the viability of a Power-to-X Economy in achieving climate targets of net-zero emissions. The high share of solar PV indicates a Solar-to-X Economy characteristic.</description></item><item><title>Development of an Optical Library for Coevaporated CdSexTe1&#8722;x</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777397</link><description>The conversion efficiency of CdTe solar cells may be improved by bandgap engineering, i.e., changing the bandgap value through the addition of Se in the absorber. The Se alloying enables a short-circuit current density improvement, as it leads to a bandgap energy value decrease. Furthermore, it has been associated with increased minority carrier lifetimes, assuring high open-circuit voltage values. An Se gradient profile control can further optimize the solar cell performance. Thus, an optical model baseline of the CdSexTe1&#8722;x (CST) compound was developed. Spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements were conducted to accurately extract the optical constants of ten CST layers deposited through coevaporation with x varying from 0 to 1. Using the measured dielectric function spectra from the discrete CST layers with varying x, and considering the composition-induced shift in the critical point energies, an energy-shift model was employed to develop the accurate optical library for the CST compound for any x value to provide data for future modeling and optimization. The library accuracy was validated through optical simulations of the quantum efficiency of a graded CST solar cell using the finite-difference time-domain method by replicating the Se profile in the absorber layer measured through secondary ion mass spectrometry.</description></item><item><title>Impact of Encapsulation Processing Conditions on Degradation Mechanisms of Carbon-Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10876559</link><description>Perovskite photovoltaic (PV) cells have achieved a record 26.7% efficiency, but improvements in stability against humidity, temperature shifts, and light exposure remain crucial. In this work, we explored mesoporous carbon-based perovskite (c-PSC) devices because of carbon's stability and the elimination of a heat-sensitive hole transport layer. Encapsulation materials exhibiting promising properties with silicon PV, including a thermoplastic polyolefin encapsulant, were applied under different lamination conditions to investigate the impact on c-PSC devices&#8217; durability, which is a novel study for this specific combination of materials. Inadequate curing can compromise adhesion, reduce moisture resistance, and accelerate perovskite decomposition under light exposure. Increasing the lamination temperature by 20&#8201;&#176;C allowed samples to withstand 1000 h of damp-heat conditions, with a 30% reduction in efficiency, while lower temperature lamination caused immediate performance drops. While light exposure remained highly degrading, higher lamination temperatures delayed damage, preserving 2.5% of the initial power conversion efficiency after 400 h of aging and slowing perovskite decomposition.</description></item><item><title>A Spot-Area Method to Evaluate the Incidence Angle Modifier of Photovoltaic Devices-Part 2: Modules (Differential Method)</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10835743</link><description>In Part 1 of our article, we presented a method to quantify the incidence angle modifier (IAM) of photovoltaic (PV) devices, which differs from the methods proposed in IEC 61853-2 through the following: it utilizes a spot-area irradiation, delivered by an optical fiber system, a customized angle probe holder, and a current-to-voltage converter. Part 1 focused on single-cell devices and presented the validation of the new method on two different cell architectures. In Part 2, we generalize that method to commercial-size silicon PV modules, mirroring by the approach already used for module-level spectral responsivity measurements described in IEC 60904-8:2014. The proposed method is motivated by inclusion in the currently ongoing revision of IEC 61853-2, providing research centers and testing laboratories with an additional option to perform IAM measurements indoors.

The combination of high temperature, relative humidity, and high ultraviolet (UV) radiation was the cause of severe degradation for the modules exposed to tropical climates (TR), whereas the module exposed to a moderate climate did not experience a significant loss in performance. The modules installed in TR, on the contrary, showed significant power degradation after approximately 8 years of exposure, primarily attributed to acetic acid-related degradation modes. Encapsulant samples were extracted from the selected modules and characterized to determine changes in chemical structure, thermal stability, and consumption of additives and stabilizers. The results of qualitative additive analysis showed that the UV absorber was no longer detectable in the front encapsulant extracted from modules exposed in TR. The consumption of the stabilizers was considered as the main cause of reduction of molar mass. The presence of acetic acid was evident in both electroluminescence images and ion chromatography results. While differential scanning calorimetry successfully detected a reduction in molar mass, thermogravimetric analysis, and infrared spectroscopy proved unsuitable for identifying chain scission phenomena.</description></item><item><title>Growing Panes: Investigating the PV Technology Trends Behind Frequent Early Failures in Modern Glass&#8211;Glass Modules</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10847304</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) module materials and technologies continue to evolve as module manufacturers and buyers try to minimize costs, maximize performance, and speed deployment. Both silicon and thin film modules are converging toward similar &#8764;3 $\text{m}^{2}$ glass&#8211;glass designs with thinner glass sheets to increase power output while reducing module weight, and both types are increasingly mounted on single-axis trackers. At the same time, an increasing number of PV sites have been reporting spontaneous glass breakage in early life systems deployed with these &#8220;big, floppy modules.&#8221; In this article, we identify the concurrent module changes that may be contributing to increased early failure, explain the trends, and discuss their reliability implications. We suggest that larger, thinner glass sheets along with variations in heat treatment and quality may be contributing to glass vulnerability. We note that trends toward weaker or back-mounted frames may also be contributing to module failures, especially for &#8220;extra-extra-large&#8221; modules mounted on trackers. Combinations of these trends may have pushed modules to a threshold at which increasing early failures are causing the front edge of the &#8220;bathtub curve&#8221; to re-emerge. Current qualification testing appears to be ineffective for catching these early failures in new module designs, and module buyers do not have enough reliability information&#8212;or cannot prioritize such information&#8212;during module procurement. Additional research is needed to identify the field conditions leading to glass breakage and if there is one or multiple limiting flaws in new module designs causing glass breakage. Early failures may be mitigated by returning to more robust designs or ensuring better module testing and quality assurance.</description></item><item><title>Investigating the Crosslinking, Degradation, and Adhesion Behavior of Photovoltaic Encapsulants Under Thermal Accelerated Aging</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804171</link><description>Degradation of photovoltaic (PV) module encapsulant characteristics that lead to mechanical embrittlement and delamination remains a cause of failure in solar installations. A multiscale reliability model connecting the encapsulant mechanical and fracture properties to the degraded molecular structure and interfacial bonding to adjacent solar cell and glass substrates was previously published. The model, developed primarily for poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) acetate (EVA) encapsulants, remains to be experimentally validated. Determining the degradation and crosslinking kinetics of alternative encapsulants, such as polyolefin elastomer (POE) and EVA/POE/EVA composites (EPE), can generalize the model. In this work, we subject fully cured EVA, POE, and EPE encapsulants to accelerated thermal aging to determine how high temperatures impact reaction kinetics. An increase in gel content (crosslinking) and decrease in crystallinity of the encapsulants under hot-aerobic (90 &#176;C, 22% RH) and hot-anaerobic (90 &#176;C, sealed in N2 air) aging were observed, even in the absence of UV and crosslinking initiators. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)-attenuated total reflectance analysis showed insignificant encapsulant degradation, demonstrating the critical role of UV and moisture in accelerating degradation. Adhesion testing performed on coupon-level specimens (cell/encapsulant/glass laminates) showed decreases in adhesion energy, Gc, from 5000 h of hot-dry (90 &#176;C, &#8764;1% RH) and hot-humid (90 &#176;C, 60% RH) aging. POE coupons demonstrated the best stability, followed by EPE then EVA. For EVA and POE, hot-humid aged coupons experienced a larger decrease in Gc due to enhanced hydrolytic degradation. Hot-dry aging condition demonstrated that thermal degradation of the interface could be significant even if the encapsulant experiences negligible degradation in the absence of UV and elevated humidity.</description></item><item><title>Comparison of Reflector Materials for a Vertical Bifacial Solar Canal</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10829584</link><description>In this article, we assessed five reflector materials for hypothetical vertical bifacial arrays as a solar canal technology option. We screened the materials (CoverMax, CoverTuff, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) Poly, polyester canvas, and Vivosun aluminized Mylar) for reflectivity, tensile strength to minimum mounting load, vapor barrier performance to reduce evaporation, and energy production. Vivosun had the highest reflectivity (albedo of 0.87&#8211;0.93) and increased annual energy production more than 40% compared with a system without reflector, but plastically deformed under tensile strength testing. All materials reduced evaporation at least fivefold compared with the control. Following our preliminary assessment, we calculated the levelized cost of electricity of a hypothetical vertical bifacial array with two height configurations (short system at 2 m and tall system at 3 m) and four hybrid reflectors (fabricated from strong base layer materials with a top layer of Vivosun) and compared these results with systems with single-material reflectors and with systems without reflectors. We found that the tall system with a hybrid reflector made from PVC Poly had the lowest levelized cost of electricity. However, when considering other performance metrics, such as tensile strength and vapor barrier performance, a hybrid reflector made from CoverMax emerged as the best candidate of the options considered.</description></item><item><title>Data-Driven Soiling Estimation and Optimized Cleaning Strategies for Industrial Rooftop PV Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10847915</link><description>The accumulation of dust and dirt on solar photovoltaic (PV) panels, known as soiling, reduces energy generation and conversion efficiency of a PV plant. Therefore, regular cleaning is essential to maintain optimal plant performance and economic viability. Fixed-interval cleaning schedules become uneconomical during periods such as low-insolation, rainy, or cloudy events. This study proposes a data-driven method to estimate the soiling ratio (SR) for a 504-kWp rooftop PV plant in India using power, temperature, and irradiance data. A PV panel temperature estimation model is employed, based on ambient temperature and solar irradiance, which simplifies the process by eliminating the need for direct temperature measurements. The analysis reveals that regular cleaning is essential despite rainfall, with energy losses due to soiling ranging from 32% to 47% across inverters, with soiling rates of 4.6&#8211;5.5% per day. A dynamic cleaning schedule, considering weather and soiling conditions, was developed to reduce these losses. Economic evaluation demonstrated that manual cleaning following the proposed dynamic schedule is cost effective, with profit margins of 48&#8211;77%, comparing energy gain and cleaning cost. Compared with fixed-interval cleaning, the proposed method maintained the same average SR but yielded 25&#8211;49% higher profitability across inverters.</description></item><item><title>A Single Voltage Sensor Bypass Switch-Based Photovoltaic Fault Localization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10877760</link><description>Photovoltaic (PV) energy systems are becoming an important source of sustainable energy. However, undiscovered faults within these systems may cause significant efficiency reduction. Localizing these faults to the module level is important for a quick fault diagnosis and maintaining the overall system efficiency. This article presents a novel method to localize intrastring, line-ground, cross-string, and partial shading faults in an $N$ &#215; $M$ PV system down to the module level. The approach utilizes a single voltage sensor in the combiner box of the PV system and $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ bypass switches per string to bypass the connected PV modules during faults. The technique initially relies on identifying the faulty string. Once this string is determined, the voltage associated with each module in that string is found. Each module's voltage in that string is obtained by measuring the string voltage after bypassing each module corresponding to an activated switch. Subsequently, the resulting linear equations are solved to obtain the voltage of each module in the faulty string. The technique is verified using simulation and an experimental setup for a 5 x 4 small-size PV system. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the technique can accurately localize faulty modules with only $N$ voltage samples of the faulty string. The proposed method is robust to variations in the maximum power point tracking algorithm, ensuring faults are localized effectively in real-time.</description></item><item><title>A Chiplet Platform for Intelligent Radar/Sonar Leveraging Domain-Specific Reusable Active Interposer</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10851388</link><description>Through chiplet reuse, chiplet-based system designs have emerged as a cost-effective solution for system-on-chips (SoCs), yet considerable silicon interposer costs often negate the benefits. Though general reusable interposers (GRIs) can lower the cost, they often compromise on performance and energy efficiency. In this article, a domain-specific reusable active interposer (active DSRI) approach is proposed for a better cost-efficiency tradeoff. Moreover, a chiplet platform based on an active DSRI designed for the intelligent radar/sonar (IRS) domain is introduced to facilitate rapid and customized SoC development. This platform offers flexible and energy-efficient interconnections tailored for IRS, platform infrastructure functions, and peripherals to simplify the chiplets. Furthermore, it integrates lightweight, composable standard 3-D interfaces across the chiplets and interposer, delivering up to 96-Gb/s bandwidth, 11.1-ns latency, and 0.62-pJ/bit energy efficiency, well controlling the cost and power penalties of SoC partition. Demonstrated with a customized hand gesture recognition sonar system (HGRSS) baseband SoC implemented on the proposed platform, it achieves similar performance to a monolithic SoC, with a recognition frame rate of 6286 frames/s, where overhead of the 3-D interface is only 6.86% in area and 4.84% in power. Our approach proves cost-effective, energy efficient, and customizable, moving system volume breakeven point forward by  $3.22\sim 3.36$  times, and reducing the cost by 58.5%~59.8%. This represents a pioneering demonstration of reusable chiplets in HGRSS, showcasing the potential of our approach for broader domains.</description></item><item><title>Protecting Analog Circuits Using Switch Mode Time Domain Locking</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10848525</link><description>Analog circuits remain vulnerable to different types of supply chain attacks including piracy, overproduction, counterfeiting, and reverse engineering. In this article, we present switch mode time domain locking (SMDL) technique to protect analog circuits. This technique integrates a locking mechanism into the time-domain functionality of the circuit. It uses random-key-based switching phases for analog circuits instead of fixed clocks that are conventionally used. The random switching phases are dependent on a key which can be made arbitrarily long. A correct key (CK) with correct alignment of phases can unlock circuit functionality. The locking technique can be applied to a variety of switch-mode analog circuits such as filters, amplifiers, regulators, among others. We implemented this technique on a folded cascode amplifier (FCA) and on a switched-capacitor bandgap reference (BGR) circuit. In both techniques, we employ a 128-bit key to lock the circuit functionality. The design is implemented in a 65-nm CMOS technology. An incorrect key (IK) introduces almost 100% variation in the circuit functionality, ensuring high level of security.</description></item><item><title>A 285-nA Quiescent Current, 94.7% Peak Efficiency Buck Converter With AOT Control for IoT Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10844997</link><description>An ultralow quiescent current dc-dc buck converter based on adaptive on-time (AOT) control is presented in this article. To minimize the energy wastage of the dc-dc buck converter circuit when the Internet-of-Things (IoT) device is in standby mode, a control loop with nano-ampere quiescent current is proposed in this converter. To reduce the quiescent current consumed by the voltage reference and improve its line sensitivity (LS), the voltage reference in the proposed converter is preregulated and based on the subthreshold CMOS implementation, with a quiescent current of only 20 nA. Meanwhile, for purpose of maintaining high efficiency of the converter under the ultralow load, an adaptive comparator based on the dynamic bias mode selection circuit is proposed, which converts the load conditions into time information and switches the bias current and gain of the comparator under ultralow loads, and the quiescent current of the comparator is only 65 nA. The proposed converter is implemented in a 0.18- $\mu $ m BCD process with an area of 1.35 mm2. Experimental results show that the converter has a minimum quiescent current of 285 nA, maintains more than 80% conversion efficiency over a load range of  $10~\mu $ A&#8211;300 mA and a peak efficiency of 94.7%, and has an output of 0.9&#8211;4.8 V over a supply condition of 2&#8211;5.5 V.</description></item><item><title>Single-Ended/Differential Wideband Track-and-Hold Amplifier in 22-nm FD-SOI CMOS Process</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10814652</link><description>The impending 6G communication based on the software defined radio (SDR) requires a radio frequency (RF) track-and-hold amplifier (THA). This THA serves as the frequency down-converter and the single-to-differential interface to the downstream analog-to-digital converter (ADC). We present a CMOS RF THA that features wide and width (18 GHz), yet high linearity (spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) of 56.7 dB) and not requiring an external balun. These features are derived from our proposed isolation technique based on our proposed double source follower enhanced (DSFE) structure. To realize the single-to-differential conversion without an external balun, we design an independent balun as the first stage. Thereafter, we employ our proposed feedforward compensation technique (FCT) along with the reported phase correction technique (PCT) to reduce the output mismatches while simultaneously enhancing the linearity and bandwidth. We monolithically realize the RF THA in 22-nm fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FD-SOI) CMOS operating at 1.8 V. Measurements depict that the input bandwidth is wide (18 GHz), yet featuring high linearity (SFDR =56.7 dB at 15 GHz) with 2 GS/s sampling rate. The power consumption and the chip area are low and small at 216 mW and 0.07 mm2, respectively. When benchmarked against reported III/V RF THAs, the proposed CMOS RF THA is very competitive&#8212;comparable bandwidth, yet simultaneously higher linearity, potentially lower cost, lower power dissipation, and smaller die area. Further because it is realized in CMOS, it facilitates integration to other CMOS circuits in the same system-on-chip (SoC).</description></item><item><title>A Flexible DA-Based Architecture for Computation of Inner Product of Variable Vectors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10871186</link><description>The computation of inner products of any given pair of vectors is an indispensable requirement in several applications including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), signal processing, image processing, communication, and many others. The throughput requirement of inner product computation varies widely for different applications. Moreover, the throughput of computation must match the requirements of the applications. It is therefore important to design flexible hardware for inner product computation that produces the desired throughput. Distributed arithmetic (DA) is a well-known approach for efficient inner product computation. This article presents an efficient DA-based architecture for computing the inner product of variable vectors, which could be tailored according to the throughput requirement of any given application and reused for different inner product lengths. The proposed designs could also be deployed to achieve a trade-off between throughput and area/energy consumption. In this article, we have used modified Booth encoding (MBE) to reduce the number of partial products and proposed a novel carry-save accumulator (CSA) for shortening the critical path delay. The proposed designs are synthesized by Cadence Genus using GPDK 90-nm technology library and place-and-route using Cadence Innovus for different inner product lengths and word lengths. As found from the postlayout synthesis results, the proposed designs offer savings of nearly 30% and 29% EPC and ADP over the bit-serial DA-based design on average for word lengths 8 and 16 and inner product lengths 8, 16, and 32, respectively.</description></item><item><title>ISARA: An Island-Style Systolic Array Reconfigurable Accelerator Based on Memristors for Deep Neural Networks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10891373</link><description>The demand for edge artificial intelligence (AI) is significant, particularly in revolutionary technological areas such as the Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and industrial control. However, reliable and high-performance edge AI is still constrained by computing hardware, and improving the performance and reliability of edge AI accelerators remains a key focus for researchers. This work proposes a memristor/resistive random access memory (RRAM)-based island-style systolic array reconfigurable accelerator (ISARA) that meets the reliability and performance requirements of edge AI. Inspired by the island-style architecture of FPGAs, this work proposes a flexible-tile architecture based on RRAM processing element (PE) islands, optimizing the data flow within the systolic array. The design of network-on-chip reduces data processing latency. In addition, to enhance computational efficiency, this work incorporates a bit-fusion scheme within the flexible tile, which reduces analog-to-digital converter (ADC) power consumption and addresses the conductance variation of RRAM. To date, only a few works have completed the entire process from simulation, design, and fabrication to hardware testing. This work fully realizes the design and validation of a new accelerator based on RRAM chips, demonstrating the reliability of RRAM-based systolic array accelerators for the first time. After deploying algorithms, the hardware accelerator achieved recognition rates comparable to software. Compared to similar works, ISARA&#8217;s computational efficiency exceeds theirs and has flexible reconfigurability. The same deep neural network (DNN) models are adopted for evaluation and compared to other accelerators, and ISARA&#8217;s processing latency is reduced by 200 times.</description></item><item><title>FAMS: A FrAmework of Memory-Centric Mapping for DNNs on Systolic Array Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843963</link><description>In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have experienced rapid development. These DNNs demonstrate significant variations in architecture and scale, creating a substantial demand for domain-specific accelerators that are optimized for both high performance and low energy consumption. Systolic array accelerators, due to their efficient dataflow and parallel processing capabilities, offer significant advantages when performing computations for DNNs. Existing studies frequently overlook various hardware constraints in systolic array accelerators when representing mapping strategies. This oversight includes ignoring the differences in delays between communication and computation operations, as well as overlooking the capacities of multilevel memory hierarchies. Such omissions can lead to inaccuracies in predicting accelerator performance and inefficiencies in system design. We propose the FAMS framework, which introduces a memory-centric notation capable of fully representing the mapping of DNN operations on systolic array accelerators. Memory-centric notation moves away from the idealized assumptions of previous notations and considers various hardware constraints, thereby expanding the effective design and mapping spaces. The FAMS framework also includes a cycle-accurate simulator, which takes the hardware configurations, task descriptions, and mapping strategy represented by memory-centric notation as inputs, providing various metrics such as latency and energy consumption. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FAMS framework reduces latency by up to 29.7% and increases throughput by 42.4% compared to the state-of-the-art TENET framework. Additionally, under hardware configurations with a MAC delay of 2 and 3 clock cycles, the FAMS framework enhances performance by 12.0% and 25.4%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>SysCIM: A Heterogeneous Chip Architecture for High-Efficiency CNN Training at Edge</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10843320</link><description>Neural network training is notoriously computationally intensive and time-consuming. Quantization technology is promising to improve training efficiency by using lower data bitwidths to reduce storage and computing requirements. Currently, state-of-the-art quantization training algorithms have a negligible loss of accuracy, which requires dedicated quantization circuits for dynamic quantization of large amounts of data. In addition, the matrix transposition problem during neural network training gradually becomes a challenge as the network size increases. To address this problem, we propose a quantized training architecture which is a heterogeneous architecture consisting of a computing-in-memory (CIM) macro and a systolic array. First, the CIM macro realizes efficient transpose matrix multiplication through flexible data path control, which handles the need for transpose operation of the weight matrix in neural network training. Second, the systolic array utilizes two different data flows in the forward (FW) and backward (BW) propagation for the transpose matrix multiplication of the activation matrix in neural network training and provides higher computational throughput. Then, we design efficient dedicated quantization circuits for quantization algorithms to support efficient quantization training. Experimental results show that the area and power consumption of the two specialized quantization circuits are reduced by a factor of 1.35 and 5.4, on average, compared to floating-point computing circuits. The architecture achieves 4.05 tera operations per second per wat (TOPS/W) energy efficiency @ INT8 convolutional neural network (CNN) training at the 28-nm process. Compared to a state of the art (SOTA) quantization training architecture, SysCIM shows  $1.8\times $  energy efficiency.</description></item><item><title>Virtual_N2_PDK: A Predictive Process Design Kit for 2-nm Nanosheet FET Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856560</link><description>Nanosheet FETs (NSFETs) are considered promising candidates to replace FinFETs as the dominant devices in sub-5-nm processes. To encourage further research into NSFET-based integrated circuits, we present Virtual_N2_PDK, a predictive process design kit (PDK) for 2-nm NSFET technology. All assumptions are based on publicly available sources. Ruthenium (Ru) interconnects are employed for the buried power rail (BPR) and tight-pitch layers. Wrap-around contact (WAC) is also integrated into Virtual_N2_PDK to investigate its impact on circuit performance. By calibrating the BSIM-CMG model with 3-D technology computer-aided design (TCAD) electrothermal simulation results, SPICE models that account for self-heating effects (SHEs) are generated for devices with and without WAC. The simulation results show that with the WAC structure, the energy-delay product (EDP) of standard cells is reduced by an average of 25.18%, while the frequency of a 15-stage ring oscillator circuit increases by 26.05%.</description></item><item><title>VCNPU: An Algorithm-Hardware Co-Optimized Framework for Accelerating Neural Video Compression</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804689</link><description>Video compression is essential for storing and transmitting video content. Real-time decoding is indispensable for delivering a seamless user experience. Neural video compression (NVC) integrates traditional coding techniques with deep learning, resulting in impressive compression efficiency. However, the real-time deployment of advanced NVC models encounters challenges due to their high complexity and extensive off-chip memory access. This article presents a novel NVC accelerator, called video compression neural processing unit (VCNPU), via an algorithm-hardware co-design framework. First, at the algorithmic level, a reparameterizable video compression network (RepVCN) is proposed to aggregate multiscale features and boost video compression quality. RepVCN can be equivalently transformed into a streamlined structure without extra computations after training. Second, a mask-sharing pruning strategy is proposed to compress RepVCN in the fast transform domain. It effectively prevents the destruction of sparse patterns caused by model simplification, maintaining the model capacity. Third, at the hardware level, a reconfigurable sparse computing module is designed to flexibly support sparse fast convolutions and deconvolutions of the compact RepVCN. Besides, a hybrid layer fusion pipeline is advocated to reduce off-chip data communication caused by extensive motion and residual features. Finally, based on the joint optimization of computation and communication, our VCNPU is constructed to realize adaptive adjustments of various decoding qualities and is implemented under TSMC 28-nm CMOS technology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RepVCN provides superior coding quality over other video compression baselines. Meanwhile, our VCNPU achieves  $6.7\times $  improvements in throughput,  $2.9\times $  in area efficiency, and  $4\times $  in energy efficiency compared to prior video processors.</description></item><item><title>Improved Step-GRAND: Low-Latency Soft-Input Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10851307</link><description>The ultrareliable low-latency communication (URLLC) application scenario requires the adoption of short linear block codes to satisfy the low-latency requirements. Guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) is a prominent universal decoding solution for short linear block codes that lends itself to efficient hardware implementations. GRAND-based hardware implementations generally offer reduced average decoding latency but their high worst-case (W.C.) latency renders them unsuitable for deployment in mission-critical applications. This article presents an improved version of step-GRAND, a soft-input variant of GRAND that features a novel test error pattern (TEP) generating approach. A novel very large-scale integration (VLSI) architecture is developed for the execution of the improved step-GRAND algorithm with reduced W.C. decoding latency. Application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementation results, employing low-power (LP) TSMC 65-nm CMOS technology, demonstrate that the proposed improved step-GRAND can achieve an average decoding latency as low as 10 ns for decoding a  $(128,105)$  linear block code at a target frame error rate (FER) of  $10^{-7}$ , while the W.C. decoding latency can reach  $300~\text {ns}\sim 1~\mu \text { s}$  depending on the parametric settings. Compared with the previously proposed baseline soft-input ordered reliability bits GRAND (ORBGRAND) hardware implementation with similar decoding performance at target FER of  $10^{-7}$ , the improved step-GRAND hardware achieves  $7 \times \sim 17\times $  reduction in W.C. latency,  $7\times $  reduction in power consumption, and  $37 \times \sim 66\times $  higher area efficiency in the W.C. scenario. Furthermore, the proposed hardware can achieve an average throughput of up to 10.5 Gb/s and a W.C. throughput of  $102\sim 350$  Mb/s.</description></item><item><title>Reconfigurable 10T SRAM for Energy-Efficient CAM Operation and In-Memory Computing</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10854884</link><description>The limitations of the von Neumann architecture in terms of power consumption and throughput are increasingly evident. In-memory computing is a promising computing paradigm to alleviate this limitation. This article proposes a high-speed and low-power 10T compute-static random-access memory (CSRAM) capable of conducting rowwise search operations and executing in-memory logic functions efficiently. A self-suppressed discharge scheme is implemented to curtail the power consumption of the search operation by reducing the discharge swing of the match lines (MLs). The rowwise search scheme avoids vertical data storage, enhancing the compatibility between different operation modes. The proposed 10T SRAM architecture addresses the issue of sneak currents effectively when multiple lines are activated. Additionally, decoupled read ports eliminate compute access disturbance. To validate the design, a 4Kb array is designed with a 40-nm CMOS technology. At a supply voltage (VDD) of 1.1 V, the in-memory logic operations are capable of operating at a frequency of 752 MHz, consuming 29.2 fJ/bit. In binary content-addressable memory (BCAM) search mode, the minimum energy consumption of 0.51 fJ/bit occurs at 0.8 V and 120 MHz.</description></item><item><title>High-Reliability and High-Throughput CIM 10T-SRAM for Multiplication and Accumulation Operations With 274.3 GOPS and 200&#8211;237.5 TOPS/W</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10816728</link><description>Artificial intelligence (AI) is extensively applied in natural language processing, image matching, and image recognition, with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) being crucial. Computing-in-memory (CIM) utilizing static random access memory (SRAM) can enhance the CNN performance.

Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADASs) may have a preexisting stage to maintain clear driving visuals in foggy situations. ADAS strives for greater image resolution at a faster frame rate in order to maintain its dependability for road safety. This tendency forces image dehazing to contend with a formidable throughput challenge with improved power constraints. This work proposes a hardware-efficient, computationally light image dehazing engine. It consists of two main techniques: the saturation-based local airlight estimation module (SLAEM) and the depth-map transmission-map estimation unit (DMTMEU). The transmission-map estimation task and the airlight estimate task can be executed concurrently due to the adopted depth map-based transmission estimation approach, eliminating the dependence between the two activities. In terms of pixels, an additional advantage of the adaptive airlight estimation approach is that it avoids the computationally demanding sorting step, which helps to increase hardware efficiency. The entire architecture utilizes look-up table (LUT)-based computations to implement division modules and exponential functions, resulting in more optimized architecture than the existing dehazing architectures. The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) CMOS 90-nm technology is used in the implementation of this study. It is arranged into a six-stage pipelining approach to create a seamless data scheduling process. It achieves a throughput of 200 Mp/s with a logic gate count of 9.309 K and a power consumption of 2.61 mW at 200 MHz.

In this article, we address this critical need by introducing the FlooNoC network-on-chip (NoC), featuring very wide, fully advanced extensible interface (AXI4) compliant links designed to meet the massive bandwidth needs at high energy efficiency. At the transport level, nonblocking transactions are supported for latency tolerance. In addition, a novel end-to-end ordering approach for AXI4, enabled by a multistream capable direct memory access (DMA) engine, simplifies network interfaces (NIs) and eliminates interstream dependencies. Furthermore, dedicated physical links are instantiated for short, latency-critical messages. A complete end-to-end reference implementation in 12-nm FinFET technology demonstrates the physical feasibility and power performance area (PPA) benefits of our approach. Using wide links on high levels of metal, we achieve a bandwidth of 645 Gb/s/link and a total aggregate bandwidth of 103 Tb/s for an  $8\times 4$  mesh of processors&#8217; cluster tiles, with a total of 288 RISC-V cores. The NoC imposes a minimal area overhead of only 3.5% per compute tile and achieves a leading-edge energy efficiency of 0.15 pJ/B/hop at 0.8 V. Compared with state-of-the-art (SoA) NoCs, our system offers three times the energy efficiency and more than double the link bandwidth. Furthermore, compared with a traditional AXI4-based multilayer interconnect, our NoC achieves a 30% reduction in area, corresponding to a 47% increase in GFLOPSDP within the same floorplan.</description></item><item><title>A Low-Cost and Triple-Node-Upset Self-Recoverable Latch Design With Low Soft Error Rate</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10848524</link><description>With the decrease in feature size of transistors, latches are more sensitive to single-event multiple node upset (MNU), including double node upset (DNU) and triple node upset (TNU).

Many IC companies outsource manufacturing to third-party foundries, creating security risks such as syntactical bugs and stealthy analog Trojans. Traditional Trojan detection methods, including embedding circuit watermarks and hardware-based monitoring, impose significant area and power overheads while failing to effectively identify and localize the Trojans. To overcome these shortcomings, we present SPICED+, a software-based framework designed for syntactical bug pattern identification and the correction of Trojans in A/MS circuits, leveraging large language model (LLM)-enhanced detection. It uses LLM-aided techniques to detect, localize, and iteratively correct analog Trojans in SPICE netlists, without requiring explicit model training, and thus incurs zero area overhead. The framework leverages chain-of-thought reasoning and few-shot learning to guide the LLMs in understanding and applying anomaly detection rules, enabling accurate identification and correction of Trojan-impacted nodes. With the proposed method, we achieve an average Trojan coverage of 93.3%, average Trojan correction rate of 91.2%, and an average false-positive rate of 1.4%.</description></item><item><title>A Pay-Per-ISE RISC-V Processor With Hardware-Assisted Orthogonal Obfuscation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10746354</link><description>Security and cost efficiency are of utmost importance for embedded processors when it comes to limiting hardware resources in IoT applications.

The contribution of this work is that the auxiliary resonator is folded into the main inductor, so that it leads to a more compact solution than a conventional scheme. Due to the S-shaped inductor&#8217;s electromagnetic (EM) characteristics, the proposed tail filter can achieve noise suppression without EM interference to the main tank. Designed and implemented in a 28-nm CMOS process, the proposed VCO operates between 12.32 and 13.84 GHz, for an 11.6% turning range. The measurements were carried out in the free-running mode, and the results show a phase noise (PN) of 118.3 dBc/Hz at a 1-MHz offset from the central frequency of 12.32 GHz. The power consumption of the VCO core is 24.5 mW, with a 0.9-V supply voltage, and this leads to a figure of merit (FoM) of 186.6 dBc/Hz.</description></item><item><title>A 360&#176; Tunable Phase Shifter With Low Phase Error Based on Bandpass Networks in 0.25- &#956;m GaN Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750908</link><description>This brief presents a 360&#176; tunable phase shifter (PS) with low phase error in a 0.25- $\mu $ m GaN-on-SiC HEMT process. To achieve these features, the design incorporates two key innovations: a novel switched-bandpass phase-shifting cell (PSC) topology and a Q-learning-based optimization algorithm, both applied for the first time in monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) PS designs. The adverse effects of the charge trapping effect in GaN HEMT switches are mitigated by using a nonlinear equivalent circuit model.

A critical step in multiterm floating-point addition is the alignment of fractions of the FP terms before adding them. Alignment is executed serially by identifying first the maximum of all exponents and then shifting the fraction of each term according to the difference of its exponent from the maximum one. Contrary to common practice, this work proposes a new online algorithm that splits the identification of the maximum exponent, the alignment shift for each fraction, and their addition to multiple fused incremental steps that can be computed in parallel. Each fused step is implemented by a new associative operator that allows the incremental alignment and addition for arbitrary number of operands. Experimental results show that employing the proposed align-and-add operators for the implementation of multiterm floating-point adders can improve delay or save significant area and power. The achieved area and power savings range between 3% and 23% and between 4% and 26%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>A Comprehensive Digital Calibration for Pipelined ADCs Using Cascaded Nonlinearity Correction</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10757307</link><description>This brief presents a digital calibration for pipelined analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) utilizing the cascaded nonlinearity correction (CNC) method. By cascading three correction layers for compensating nonlinearities in different parts of pipelined ADC, it comprehensively calibrates distortion in both ADC front end and back end with a low hardware cost. In addition, this work employs a discriminative fine-tuning least-mean-square (DFT-LMS) algorithm with varying step sizes for different layers, thereby improving both the convergence speed and the accuracy. An 800-MS/s, 12-bit ring amplifier-based pipelined ADC is presented to verify the proposed calibration technique. With calibration, the SFDR has a 26.7-dB improvement at low frequency and 23.6-dB improvement at Nyquist frequency, resulting in over 6-dB improvement compared with prior-art calibration techniques. The calibration algorithm has been verified on a TSMC 28-nm CMOS process. The experimental results show that the proposed ADC calibrator has an area of  $6592~\mu $ m2 and consumes 5.31 mW at 800-MHz clock rate.</description></item><item><title>FANNS: An FPGA-Based Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search Accelerator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10885776</link><description>Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) based on high-dimensional vectors has been extensively utilized in data science and neural networks.

To operate from a sub-1-V supply, two capacitors are first pre-charged to a supply-independent initial voltage (&gt;1 V) by regulated charge pumps (RCPs) and then discharged through two diode-connected BJTs. By using different discharge times, proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) and complementary to absolute temperature (CTAT) voltages can be generated. These are then read out by an area- and energy-efficient charge-balancing  $\Delta \Sigma $  modulator to generate a digital representation of temperature. To reduce its noise, the modulator&#8217;s first inverter-based integrator employs both chopping and auto-zeroing. Fabricated in a standard 22-nm bulk CMOS process, the sensor occupies 0.01 mm2 and consumes  $2.9~{\mu }$  W from a 0.8-V supply.

The proposed design adjusts the sensitivity of the micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) by adaptively biasing it at different input amplitudes, thereby extending the dynamic range (DR). The proposed adaptive biasing technique allows the induced electrostatic force to function as a mechanical gain prior to the analog front end (AFE), consequently relaxing the noise performance requirements of the readout electronics. A capacitive feedback (CFB) instrumentation amplifier (IA) with an adjustable gain is employed to effectively reduce the thermal noise introduced by the feedback resistor in conventional resistive feedback (RFB) IAs. A sub-sampling amplitude detector (SSAD) composed of cascaded low-order decimation filters is proposed to achieve efficient acoustic volume detection. The detection results are used to control a fast-settling predictive reference charge pump (PRCP). The PRCP adopts a closed-loop architecture to achieve accurate adjustable bias voltage, with the proposed prediction logic to significantly reduce the settling time. The proposed system achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 68.2 dB at 94 dBSPL and an acoustic overload point (AOP) of 133 dBSPL, with a current consumption of  $430~{\mu }$ A at a clock frequency of 3.072 MHz.

The presented converter features a non-binary partial loop unrolled (LU) SAR SubADC architecture that leverages multiple comparators, thus enabling better tradeoff between noise and power compared to conventional SAR. Offsets mismatches among comparators of each SubADC are calibrated in background by detecting patterns in the SAR output decisions. This results in no need for any analog hardware reconfigurability or additional phase overhead.

To effectively lower these costs, this article presents a 10-bit fully synthesizable STDC design using a removal-free common-mode time dithering technique, which significantly reduces the numbers of delay cells and D-type flip-flops (DFFs) required for requisite levels of stochastic operation. This also reduces the size of the associated backend unary-to-binary (U2B) encoder. In addition, passive approximate adders are used to further reduce the area of the U2B for a compact design and significantly lower time for digital place and route. Two STDC prototypes are implemented in a 12-nm FinFET process with a conventional adder and passive approximate adder, respectively. STDC prototypes achieve energy efficiency of 160 dB, while the one using passive approximation adder improves the area efficiency from 28.6 to  $19.1~{\mu \text {m}^{2}}$ /step.</description></item><item><title>A 0.38-mW 200-kHz-BW Digital-Intensive Single-Opamp Fourth-Order Continuous-Time Delta-Sigma Modulator With Third-Order Digital Noise Coupling in 28-nm CMOS</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804627</link><description>This article presents a digital-intensive, single-opamp, 4th-order continuous-time delta-sigma modulator (CT DSM) architecture with a simple and low-power 3rd-order digital noise-coupling (DNC) assisted by a successive approximation register (SAR). To address the limited maximum stable amplitude (MSA) issue in high-order noise coupling, a digital back-end integrator is adopted to suppress the large input signal at the quantizer&#8217;s input, achieving an MSA of &#8722;1.6 dBFS even with aggressive noise shaping in a single-loop design. A digital adder-free 3rd-order DNC filter is introduced, which performs the addition directly in the charge domain using the capacitor digital-to-analog converter (DAC) in the SAR quantizer. Fabricated in 28-nm CMOS, the prototype demonstrates that a high-order CT DSM can be realized with a reduced analog burden by shifting most of the signal processing of the loop filter (LF) to the digital domain. It achieves a peak signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and dynamic range (DR) of 89.0, 89.2, and 92.1 dB, respectively, across a 200-kHz bandwidth while consuming only 0.38 mW from a 1.1-V supply.

Traditional BB converters often suffer from significant output ripples and voltage spikes, which this work aims to address by employing an inductor-last topology combined with a multilevel switched-capacitor (SC) stage. Previous strategies (both single- and multi-mode) for controlling the SC stage have resulted in either increased output voltage  $(V_{\text {O}})$  ripples or non-smooth transitions between buck and boost modes, leading to  $V_{\text {O}}$  fluctuations during mode changes. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a control technique that seamlessly covers both buck and boost conversions with a single duty cycle (D) while maintaining a lower output ripple. In this work, the flying capacitor, employed in the SC stage, is reutilized for driving the power switches, thereby eliminating the bootstrap overhead. In addition, an adaptive ramp generator is incorporated to ensure immunity to time-division multiple access (TDMA) noise for mobile applications. The SDC-BB converter, fabricated using a 180-nm CMOS process, achieved an output ripple of less than 2.1 mV with a peak efficiency of 96.6%, using a 4.7- $\mu $ H inductor, a 10-  $\mu $ F output capacitor, and a 1-MHz switching frequency. Furthermore, it demonstrated output fluctuations within 2.1 mV during transitions between buck and boost modes and verified immunity to TDMA noise with a transient  ${\Delta } {V_{\text {O}}}$  of 5.8 mV under a 0.5-V input voltage change over  $20~{\mu }$ s.</description></item><item><title>A Monolithic 5.7 A/mm2 91% Peak Efficiency Scalable Multistage Modular Switched Capacitor Voltage Regulator for Base Die Vertical Power Delivery in 3D-ICs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10873362</link><description>The rapid increase of silicon die area and power requirements of modern processors, requires a minimal power delivery footprint.

The transceiver features a host interface composed of eight TX and RX lanes compliant with the optical internetworking forum (OIF) common electrical I/O (CEI) 112G very short reach (VSR) and IEEE 802.3 chip to module (C2M) standards and integrates eight TX and RX lanes on the optical (line) side. Three fully integrated high-voltage optical TXs have been integrated with minimum area and power overhead by changing only few top metal masks: 3-Vpp silicon photonics (SiPho), 3-V open drain (OD), and 1.5-Vpp electro absorption modulated laser (EML) driver. External additional drivers suitable, e.g., for vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) applications are supported by exploiting optical driver software reconfigurability into standard driver mode. The optical RXs, identical for all the applications, are digital signal processing (DSP) based, with the analog section consisting of a variable gain amplifier (VGA) and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The VGA can be dc coupled to an external trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) without the need for external components. The chip is implemented in 5-nm FinFET technology and it is designed to deliver the target performance both in package and bare die.

The chopping modulation further reduces the charge pump&#8217;s white noise by filtering out high-order harmonics of folded noise, thereby significantly lowering in-band noise. In addition, a high-swing class-C/F2 voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is proposed to optimize out-of-band noise while maintaining low power consumption. Fabricated in 65-nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) with a core area of 0.64 mm2, the SS-CPLL achieves an in-band phase noise of &#8722;111.9 dBc/Hz at 1-kHz offset, an integrated jitter of 49.9 fs, and a figure-of-merit (FoM) of &#8722;257.1 dB at 9 GHz, while consuming 7.8 mW of power. The proposed SS-CPLL reduces in-band noise by approximately 15 dB compared with a conventional sub-sampling phase-locked loop (SSPLL), while maintaining a similar reference spur level of &#8722;58 dBc/Hz. This highlights the effectiveness of the C-CP and charge-share cancellation techniques.</description></item><item><title>A 2000-volumes/s 3-D Ultrasound Probe With Monolithically-Integrated 23 &#215; 23-mm&#178; 4096 -Element CMUT Array</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10880503</link><description>This article presents a 4096-element ultrasound probe for high volume-rate (HVR) cardiovascular imaging. The probe consists of two application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), each of which interfaces with a 2048-element monolithically-integrated capacitive micro-machined ultrasound transducer (CMUT) array. The probe can image a  $60{^{\circ }} \times 60{^{\circ }} \times 10$ -cm volume at 2000 volumes/s, the highest volume-rate with in-probe channel-count reduction reported to date. It uses  $2\times 2$  delay-and-sum micro-beamforming ( $\mu $ BF) and  $2\times $  time-division multiplexing (TDM) to achieve an  $8\times $  receive (RX) channel-count reduction. Equalization, trained using a pseudorandom bit-sequence generated on the chip, reduces TDM-induced crosstalk by 10 dB, enabling power-efficient scaling of the cable drivers. The ASICs also implement a novel transmit (TX) beamformer (BF) that operates as a programmable digital pipeline, which enables steering of arbitrary pulse-density modulated (PDM) waveforms. The TX BF drives element-level 65 V unipolar pulsers, which in turn drive the CMUT array. Both the TX BF and RX  $\mu $ BF are programmed with shift-registers (SRs) that can either be programmed in a row-column fashion for fast upload times, or daisy-chain fashion for a higher flexibility. The layout of the ASICs is matched to the 365- $\mu $ m-pitch monolithically-integrated CMUT array. While operating, the RX and logic power consumption per element is 0.85 and 0.10 mW, respectively. TX power consumption is highly waveform dependent, but is nominally 0.34 mW. Compared to the prior art, the probe has the highest volume rate, and features among the largest imaging arrays (both in terms of element-count and aperture) with a high flexibility in defining the TX waveform. These properties make it a suitable option for applications requiring HVR imaging of a large region of interest.</description></item><item><title>Single-X-Ray Sensitive Energy-Binning Dosimeter for Closed-Loop Cancer External-Beam Radiotherapy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10856346</link><description>X-ray radiation dose delivered during cancer external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is nonlinear with the biological effect imparted to cancer cells and neighboring healthy tissues. This oftentimes leads to insufficient damage to cancer cells and excessive damage to the surrounding healthy tissues, both increasing toxicity and the risk of cancer recurrence later in life for many patients. An understanding of X-ray energy deposition at the single-X-ray level is, therefore, necessary to improve the efficacy of cancer radiotherapy. Here, we present a single-X-ray sensitive, energy-binning integrated circuit (IC)-based dosimeter, fabricated in 180 nm CMOS technology, to enable closed-loop cancer radiotherapy for personalized patient treatment. We use small  $3{\times }3~{\mu }$ m reverse-biased deep n-well (DNWELL) diodes designed at low capacitive nodes ( ${C} {_{\mathrm {diode}}}$ ), such that the miniscule charge deposition ( ${Q} {_{\mathrm {dep}}}$ ) from single X-rays at these nodes generates a voltage signal large enough to be sensed ( ${V} {_{\mathrm {diode}}}{=}{Q} {_{\mathrm {dep}}}$ / ${C} {_{\mathrm {diode}}}$ ). In order to enable single-X-ray energy resolution without significant power and area, we implement an analog voltage supply (AVDDH) ~log resistor grid to create a sensitivity gradient across the  $76{\times }55$  pixel array. The IC-based dosimeter was tested under scenarios consistent with the treatment of shallow lesions (e.g., skin cancer, superficial tumors, intraoperative radiotherapy). The system is highly linear with radiation dose (10&#8211;250 cGy) and accurately tracks dose up to 2 cm deep in tissue for 50-, 70-, and 100-kV X-ray beams.</description></item><item><title>A 0.5-V 6.14- &#956;W Trimming-Free Single-XO Dual-Output Frequency Reference With [5.1-nJ, 120- &#956;s] XO Start-Up and [8.1-nJ, 200- &#956;s] Successive-Approximation-Based RTC Calibration</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10675592</link><description>This article presents a trimming-free single-crystal dual-output (SXDO) frequency reference that incorporates an on-chip 1-MHz real-time clock (RTC) calibrated against a 16-MHz crystal oscillator (XO) using a successive-approximation technique, eliminating the demand for an RTC crystal. In addition, the 1-MHz RTC, through a delay-locked loop (DLL) with a 16-tap voltage-controlled delay line (VCDL), can synthesize a multiply-by-16 signal to excite the crystal and expedite the XO&#8217;s start-up time ( ${t} {_{\text {s}}}$ ). Fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, the SXDO frequency reference occupies 0.057 mm2. The XO, leveraging the DLL-based injection scheme, achieves  ${t} {_{\text {s}}}$  of  $120~{\mu }$ s ( ${V} {_{\text {DD}}} {=} 0.5$  V) while consuming only 5.1 nJ of start-up energy. Moreover, the RTC accomplishes the calibration in  $200~\mu $ s with an energy of 8.1 nJ. With a calibration interval of 0.1 s, it can maintain its frequency accuracy amid a temperature step of  $0.3~{^{\circ }}$ C/s.</description></item><item><title>A CMOS Flash LiDAR Sensor With In-Pixel Zoom Histogramming Time-to-Digital Converters</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10777844</link><description>This article presents a solid-state flash light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor with an in-pixel zoom histogramming time-to-digital converter (hTDC). The proposed zoom hTDC combines two different conversion techniques such as the direct time-of-flight (ToF) and indirect ToF (iToF), realizing a two-step coarse-fine TDC architecture based on a single 10-b histogramming-bit (Hb) time-gated event/linear up-down counter (UDC). A 6-b time-bit (Tb) coarse TDC is implemented with a successive approximation (SA) algorithm in that the ToF value is found out by the binary search manner, dramatically reducing the number of memories from  $2{^{T_{\text {b}}} \times \text { H}_{\text {b}}}$  to  ${T_{\text {b}}} {+}$  Hb. The UDC is utilized for counting the single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) events for calculating the histogram in the coarse SA-hTDC mode, while it is reconfigured to the up-counter for estimating the phase difference which is taken by a ratio of linear counts between adjacent coarse bins in the fine iToF mode. Fabricated in a 110-nm CIS process, the prototype flash LiDAR sensor with a  $100{\times } 76$  pixel array demonstrates a 20-fps depth imaging acquisition in indoor environments. A 10-fps depth imaging at outdoor environments up to 10-m range consumes 154.5 mW. The maximum detectable range of 50 m is measured, and the depth resolutions of both to-digital converters (TDCs) are given by 150 and 9 cm, respectively, under an infrared (IR) emitter with a peak power of 75 W and a duty cycle of 0.08%.</description></item><item><title>A Recursive N-Path Switched-Capacitor Rectifier for Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659734</link><description>This article presents a recursive N-path switched-capacitor (SC) rectifier that improves the amount of power extracted from a piezoelectric transducer (PT) over prior SC PT interface circuits while using the same passive volume size. The proposed rectifier increases the number of generated steps per capacitor exponentially over that of previous SC harvesters by moving the capacitor array after the employed full-bridge rectifier (FBR) and connecting the array capacitors together in series in all possible permutations. With a larger number of steps, the proposed rectifier achieves a smaller PT internal capacitance switching loss and a higher harvesting efficiency than that of prior SC rectifiers using the same passive volume size. The proposed SC rectifier also emulates conjugate matching by generating a staircase approximation of the maximum power point voltage waveform across a PT in response to its current,  ${i} {_{P}}$ , which minimizes the harmonic losses in the internal transducer shunt resistance. The rectifier capacitors successively accumulate the charge supplied by  $i_{P}$ , and therefore, their voltages naturally settle at the average of the input part that they see each cycle. Measurements of a 0.18- $\mu $ m prototype demonstrate the merits of the proposed rectifier where up to  $13.9{\times }$  power extraction improvement is achieved over an active FBR.</description></item><item><title>Enhancing Efficiency in Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting: Collaborative-Flip Synchronized Switch Harvesting on Capacitors Rectifier and Multioutput DC-DC Converters Utilizing Shared Capacitors</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10685547</link><description>This article proposes a novel collaborative-flip synchronized switch harvesting on capacitors (CF-SSHCs) rectifier and multioutput synchronous dc-dc converters with shared capacitors. Compared to the traditional SSHC, our CF-SSHC rectifier can increase the number of flipping phases, potentially enhancing the flipping efficiency and output power under specific conditions where  $C_{\text {FLY}}$  is close to  $C_{P}$ . The synchronous dc-dc converters reuse the flying capacitors to achieve a high maximum output power improving rate (MOPIR) over a limited input power range and provide multiple outputs. This work achieves an advanced number of flipping phases in capacitor-based rectifier interface technology and explores multiple-input multiple-output configurations, evaluating the system&#8217;s performance under periodic and shock conditions for the first time. The system&#8217;s adaptability to various piezoelectric transducer (PT) array configurations is validated, highlighting its potential for Internet of Things (IoT) networks. The design is fabricated in standard 0.18- $\mu $ m CMOS. Measurement results demonstrate that the voltage flipping efficiency of up to 83% is achieved. Compared with full-bridge rectifier (FBR), the MOPIR can be increased to  $5.06\times $  and  $4.78\times $  under off-resonance and on-resonance excitation, respectively. It can also achieve a  $2.14\times $  power enhancement under shock excitation. Additionally, when the input power  $P_{\mathrm {IN\_FBR}}$  is in the range of 1.42&#8211; $28.4~\mu $ W, the MOPIR of the proposed system is always greater than 4.</description></item><item><title>A 7-bit 1.75-GS/s 6.9-fJ/conv.-step FoMw Loop-Unrolled Fully Asynchronous SAR ADC in 3-nm CMOS for a 224-Gb/s SerDes Receiver</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10723273</link><description>This article presents a 1.75-GS/s single-channel 7-bit successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that is based on loop-unrolled architecture with N-comparators for N-bits. A memory-less fully asynchronous SAR is proposed to lower power consumption and reduce design complexity. A double-tail feed-backward (DTFB) dynamic comparator is proposed to meet the required speed and minimize thermal noise, which is a critical parameter for a 7-bit SAR ADC. The prototype ADC is implemented in a 3-nm CMOS process. The ADC achieves an SNDR/SFDR of 37/49 dB at Nyquist, 0.00055-mm2 area, and consumes 0.69-mW power. This leads to a best-in-class Walden figure of merit (FoMw) of 6.9 fJ/conv.-step and a Schreier FoM of 158 dB at Nyquist. This SAR ADC is used in a 64-way time-interleaved (TI) ADC to achieve 112-GS/s operation for use in an ADC-based 224-Gb/s PAM4 SerDes receiver.</description></item><item><title>A 65 nm General-Purpose Compute-in-Memory Processor Supporting Both General Programming and Deep Learning Tasks</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10679157</link><description>This work presents a special unified compute-in-memory (CIM) processor supporting both general-purpose computing and deep neural network (DNN) operations, referred to as the general-purpose CIM (GPCIM) processor.

However, it asks for an accurate residue amplification to avoid severe quantization noise leakage from the frontend stage. Therefore, a charge-efficient correlated-level-shifting (CECLS) assisted residue amplifier (RA) is designed by inserting the level-shifting network (LSN) in a two-stage floating inverter amplifier (FIA). In addition to the inherited low-power merit from FIA, it boosts the equivalent open-loop gain to 92 dB while preventing bandwidth reduction and charge-sharing effects, making the amplification more accurate and faster than prior CLS-assisted amplifiers. The prototype is fabricated using 55 nm CMOS technology and occupies an active area of 0.26 mm $^{\mathbf {2}}$ . The measurement results show a 96.2 dB peak-SNDR and 871 nW power consumption under a 1.2 V supply voltage with a 16 kS/s sampling rate.

Recently, biomedical applications of probabilistic computing such as Bayesian networks for disease diagnosis, DNA sequencing, etc. have attracted significant attention owing to their high energy-efficiency. Bayesian inference is widely used for decision making based on independent (often conflicting) sources of information/evidence. A cascaded chain or tree structure of asynchronous circuit elements known as Muller C-elements can effectively implement Bayesian inference. Such circuits utilize stochastic bit streams to encode input probabilities which enhances their robustness and fault-tolerance. However, the CMOS implementations of Muller C-element are bulky and energy hungry which restricts their widespread application in resource constrained IoT and mobile devices such as UAVs, robots, space rovers, etc. In this work, for the first time, we propose a compact and energy-efficient implementation of Muller C-element utilizing a single Ferroelectric FET and use it for cancer diagnosis task by performing Bayesian inference with high accuracy on Wisconsin data set. The proposed implementation exploits the unique drain-erase, program inhibit and drain-erase inhibit characteristics of FeFETs to yield the output as the polarization-state of the ferroelectric layer. Our extensive investigation utilizing an in-house developed experimentally calibrated compact model of FeFET reveals that the proposed C-element consumes (worst-case) energy of 4.1 fJ and an area  $0.07~\mu m^{2}$  and outperforms the prior implementations in terms of energy-efficiency and footprint while exhibiting a comparable delay. We also propose a novel read circuitry for realising a Bayesian inference engine by cascading a network of proposed FeFET-based C-elements for practical applications. Furthermore, for the first time, we analyze the impact of cross-correlation between the stochastic input bit streams on the accuracy of the C-element based Bayesian inference implementation.</description></item><item><title>A &#8220;2 + 1&#8221; Cores Triple-Mode Oscillator</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10718325</link><description>This paper proposes a millimeter-wave (mmW) oscillator with &#8220; $2+1$ &#8221; cores and triple operation modes to realize an octave-tuning range. An auxiliary core, comprising a switch and a negative transconductance cell, is introduced to the regular dual-core oscillator to generate a third mode with enhanced effective Q. This auxiliary core not only broadens the tuning range without compromising phase noise or chip area but also avoids the risk of introducing mismatch into two regular cores like triple-core oscillators. The demand for low interconnect resistance is relieved because of the merits of less core mismatch and extra magnetic injection lock path. The behavior of the proposed oscillator in different modes is studied analytically. A quantitative analysis of phase noise and interconnect resistance in the dual-core oscillator is presented and verified against circuit simulations. Implemented in a 65-nm CMOS process, the oscillator achieves a 72.24% tuning range from 16.35 to 35.48 GHz and a peak figure-of-merit of tuning range and area (FoM $_{\mathrm {TA}}$ ) of -217.07 dBc/Hz at 20.27 GHz with 1 MHz frequency offset.

To simplify the driving stages of power amplifiers and enable large-scale integration in millimeter-wave systems, a proposed gain-boosted technique is introduced. This technique enhances the conversion gain of the mixer without increasing power consumption or footprint, achieved through the synergistic combination of negative resistance compensation (NRC) and current-reuse techniques. Furthermore, a wideband balance compensation technique is utilized at the local oscillator (LO) input, and an active balun is implemented at the intermediate frequency (IF) input, replacing the conventional large-area passive balun. These innovations lead to a more compact high-gain mixer design while achieving high-speed performance. For validation, the proposed up-conversion mixer is fabricated in a 40-nm CMOS. It boasts a total area of 0.15 mm2 ( $0.033~\lambda ^{2}$ ), with a core area of 0.024 mm2 ( $0.0052~\lambda ^{2}$ ). It achieves a measured conversion gain of 4.1 dB at 136 GHz. The measured saturation power is &#8722;5 dBm, with a data transmission rate of 42 Gbps, while consuming a power consumption of 10.8 mW only. To the best of our knowledge, this design achieves the highest conversion gain among D-band up-conversion mixers in CMOS technology and represents the smallest footprint among up-conversion mixers integrated with balun in D-band.</description></item><item><title>A 50 Gb/s PAM-4 Transceiver With High-Swing Driver, Dual-Loop Analog Equalizer, and Integrator-Based Baud-Rate Linear CDR for Short-Reach Links</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10718355</link><description>This paper presents a 50 Gb/s four-level pulse amplitude modulation 4 (PAM-4) wireline transceiver that incorporates a high-swing PAM-4 driver in the transmitter (TX) and an integrator-based baud-rate linear clock and data recovery (IB-CDR) in the receiver (RX). The PAM-4 driver in the TX employs two types of non-return to zero (NRZ)-current mode logic (CML) drivers. The proposed architecture overcomes the inherent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) limitations of PAM-4 by generating signal amplitudes greater than the supply voltage (VDD). The RX features an IB-CDR that can determine the phase difference between the PAM-4 signal and the sampling clock using the sign and magnitude of the integrators. Consequently, because the IB-CDR can reduce the requirement for additional threshold voltages and samplers for CDR operation, the RX can achieve a competitive Figure-of-Merit with reduced hardware overhead. Moreover, a dual-loop analog equalizer (DAEQ) is introduced to mitigate inter-symbol interference between the TX and RX. In the DAEQ, one loop increases the peak gain, while another loop controls the system bandwidth. The proposed TX and RX were fabricated using a 28 nm CMOS technology and has a maximum data rate of 50 Gb/s. The prototype with a total area of 0.18 mm2 enables a bit error rate of  $10^{-11}$  at 15.3 dB attenuation and has a power efficiency of 3.28 pJ/bit.</description></item><item><title>VLSI Architecture Design for Compact Shortcut Denoising Autoencoder Neural Network of ECG Signal</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10857698</link><description>The Electrocardiogram (ECG) test detects and records cardiac-related electrical activity of the heart. The ECG test identifies and documents cardiac-related electrical activity in the heart. The use of ECG signals for cardiovascular disease nursing as a crucial component of preoperative evaluation is increasing. ECG signals need to denoise and display in a clear waveform due to the numerous noises. We have introduced Compact Shortcut Denoising Auto-encoder (CS-DAE) neural network, which reduces the noise from ECG signals. The Compact Shortcut approach compresses the features passed through the shortcut layers, which lowers the operation&#8217;s memory needs and improves the noise reduction impact. In addition, the encoder and decoder process the Pixel-Unshuffled and Pixel-Shuffled, which effectively mitigates the feature loss caused by down-sampling and up-sampling operations. As a result, the CS-DAE algorithm decreases the computation and required memory size while maintaining higher accuracy. We have used MITDB and NSTDB datasets for training and testing the proposed CS-DAE model, resulting in the average Percentage of Root Mean Square Difference (PRD) being 46.30% and the improvement of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNRimp) being 10.50. In addition, we have designed VLSI architect ure for the proposed CS-DAE neural network to accelerate low hardware cost and less computation. The TUL PYNQTM-Z2 development platform runs the Verilog code, which is used for VLSI architecture and has the lowest power consumption of 1.65W.</description></item><item><title>Eyelet: A Cross-Mesh NoC-Based Fine-Grained Sparse CNN Accelerator for Spatio-Temporal Parallel Computing Optimization</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10736682</link><description>Fine-grained sparse convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve a better trade-off between model accuracy and size than coarse-grained sparse CNNs. Due to irregular data structures and unbalanced computation loads, fine-grained sparse CNNs struggle to fully leverage the performance advantages of computation and storage on general-purpose edge hardware. However, existing custom sparse accelerators are designed from the perspective of emulating a balanced load by software or computational strategies, neglecting the exploration of the computing architecture&#8217;s adaptability and parallelism for fine-grained sparse models. To address these challenges, a cross-mesh NoC-based accelerator architecture is proposed. This architecture aligns with the irregular characteristics of fine-grained sparse CNN weights and enhances the spatio-temporal parallelism of fine-grained sparse CNNs. First, a sparse multiplier unit (SMU) array and an adder array are designed to enable parallel execution of convolution multiplication and accumulation operations. Then, element-wise unroll-based nonzero weight multiplication is mapped to the SMU array to provide more flexible spatial parallelism. A horizontal and vertical cross-mesh NoC is proposed for flexible dataflow scheduling between the SMU and adder arrays to further improve temporal parallelism. This architecture allows the multiplication and accumulation operations in convolution to be decoupled and pipelined with negligible latency. Finally, the proposed accelerator architecture is implemented on the ZU9EG platform. The experimental results show that the proposed accelerator achieves frame rates of 509.9, 249.3, 100.7, 48.4, and 168.9 frames per second (FPS) for AlexNet, VGG-16, ResNet-18, MobileNet-v2, and EfficientNet, respectively.

These spike trains are designed to withstand neural fluctuations and spike losses while accurately encapsulating the spatial and precise temporal characteristics of audio, along with the intensity of incoming vibrations. Noteworthy features include the ability to generate real-time spike trains with minimal information loss and the capacity to reconstruct original signals. This fine-tuning capability allows users to optimize spike rates, achieving an optimal balance between output quality and power consumption. Furthermore, the integration of a feedback system into Spiketrum enables selective amplification of specific features while attenuating others, facilitating adaptive power consumption based on application requirements. The hardware implementation supports both spike-based and non-spike-based processors, making it versatile for various computing systems. The cochlea&#8217;s ability to encode diverse sensory information, extending beyond sound waveforms, positions it as a promising sensory input for current and future spike-based intelligent computing systems, offering compact and real-time spike train generation.</description></item><item><title>GSLP-CIM: A 28-nm Globally Systolic and Locally Parallel CNN/Transformer Accelerator With Scalable and Reconfigurable eDRAM Compute-in-Memory Macro for Flexible Dataflow</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10758245</link><description>This article reports a globally systolic and locally parallel (GSLP) convolutional NN (CNN) and Transformer accelerator based on the scalable and reconfigurable (SR) embedded dynamic random-access memory (eDRAM) compute-in-memory (CIM) macro.

However, there are two main challenges in this development model: 1) The end-to-end iteration cycle and cost of processor chip development are too high, and cannot flexibly respond to changes in chip fragmented design specifications. 2) Processor chip verification is less agile, and there is a lack of a full-chain processor agile design platform that can be easily ported to different development environments. To tackle both issues, we propose an object-oriented hardware agile design methodology, oriented by time, cost, and complexity, and have built the RIVL platform to support the agile development process for processors. RIVL integrates a highly automated design flow for processor RTL design, Integration, Verification, and Layout design to improve processor development efficiency. We achieved tape-out verification of more than 60 RISC-V processors through agile design methods, demonstrating the use and effectiveness of RIVL. We quantify the performance of CoreGen using CoreMark and demonstrate that CoreGen achieves industry-competitive performance.</description></item><item><title>FALSAx: An Integrated Framework for Accuracy and Logic Synthesis Estimation of Approximate Adders</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10807460</link><description>This work proposes an integrated framework for accuracy and logic synthesis (LS) estimation of approximate adders (FALSAx). It represents a versatile and robust framework designed to estimate the accuracy, power, and area of various approximate adders (AxAs) for any input width (W) and K bits of approximation using machine learning (ML) models. FALSAx facilitates performance predictions and optimization for different AxAs configurations through meticulously curated datasets and ML-driven analysis. The framework&#8217;s capability to automatically generate Pareto fronts from estimated values aids in identifying optimal trade-offs among crucial metrics, providing essential insights for circuit design and optimization. The FALSAx includes four internal frameworks: FrAQ, PILSE, and FELSE, which estimates dynamic power, total leakage power, and area, with frequency variations automatically, and the FALED dataset of the FALSAx. As a case study, this work analyzed 16 types of AxAs on FALSAx: AMA-V, AxPPA, COPY, TRUNC, ETA, LOA, HOERAA, LDCA, LZTA, HEAA, M-HEAA, HERLOA, M-HERLOA, HOAANED, OLOCA, and SETA. The rigorous analysis provided by FALSAx revealed that HERLOA, M-HERLOA, M-HEAA, and AxPPA demonstrated superior accuracy metrics such as SSIM, NCC, MAE, and MRE. Furthermore, power analysis showed that AxPPA exhibited the best power efficiency for lower approximation bits ( $K \leq 3$ ). At the same time, gate-free adders like COPY, TRUNC, AMA-V, LDCA, and LZTA were more power-efficient for higher approximation bits ( $K \gt 3$ ). Area estimations indicated that AxPPA maintained competitive efficiency for lower approximation bits ( $K \leq 5$ ), while TRUNC and LDCA were more efficient for higher bits ( $K \gt 5$ ).</description></item><item><title>Correct and Verify&#8212;CAV: Exploiting Binary Decision Diagrams to Enable Formal Verification of Approximate Adders With Correct Carry Bits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10790927</link><description>Approximate adders have received significant attention as they give benefits in power, performance, and area for error-resilient applications. Due to their ubiquitous use, formal verification of approximate adders has also gained traction. However, prior works on formal verification of approximate adders are limited to relaxed equivalence checking, i.e., checking whether the approximate adder designs have an error less than a specified threshold. This method has limitations, as multiple approximate adder designs can satisfy the relaxed equivalence checking criterion, which can cause more than expected deterioration in the output quality. The deterioration in output quality is larger in approximate adder designs that produce exact results for some regions of the input space but have the freedom to produce approximate results in other regions of the input space. In this paper, we propose a methodology called Correct and Verify (CAV), which exploits Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) to guarantee that the approximate adder with correct carry bits exactly matches its functional specification. Our idea takes advantage of the BDD structure in extracting the internal signals, particularly the carry signal from the golden reference exact adder. Afterward, a corrector circuit is generated from the functional specification and the extracted carry signal is used as input in the corrector circuit. The corrector circuit is used to generate the corrected adder from the approximate adder. The generated corrected adder can be compared against a formally verified golden reference exact adder. We show the efficacy of CAV over approximate Ripple Carry Adders (RCA) as well as approximate Parallel Prefix Adders (PPA). Lastly, we perform a qualitative analysis by introducing mutations in the designs to show the fault detection quality of the CAV methodology.</description></item><item><title>Universal Finite-Time Observer-Based ITSMC for Converter-Driven Motor Systems With Disturbances</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10683760</link><description>Considering the speed regulation problem of converter-driven motor systems (CDMS), a composite finite-time anti-disturbance control scheme is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the controller design process is mainly divided into two blocks according to block backstepping control techniques. Then, by constructing universal finite-time observers (UFTO), immeasurable system dynamics and multiple disturbances are estimated, simultaneously. Based on the estimated information, the integral terminal sliding mode control (ITSMC) strategies devised for the CDMS exhibit robust disturbance rejection capabilities. Compared with existing methods, the proposed composite control scheme is distinguished by its reliance solely on measured output, enhanced dynamic response speed, superior disturbance rejection capability, and a more streamlined controller design. Furthermore, a rigorous global finite-time stability analysis is presented for the closed-loop system. Finally, numerous experimental results are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.</description></item><item><title>Finite-Time Sliding Mode Control for NPC Converters With Enhanced Disturbance Compensation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10736007</link><description>In this paper, a generalized proportional integral observer (GPIO)-based finite-time sliding mode control scheme is proposed to enhance the convergence rate and disturbance rejection capacity of the grid-connected three-level neutral-point-clamped (NPC) converter. Firstly, a generalized super-twisting algorithm (GSTA) is designed in the voltage regulation loop and the instantaneous power loop of the NPC converter. Compared with the conventional super-twisting algorithm (STA), this method provides a faster convergence speed while the system trajectories are far from the origin, which is applied to the NPC converter to improve its dynamic performance and robustness. Additionally, by introducing a generalized proportional integral observer (GPIO) combined with the GSTA in the voltage regulation loop, the unknown time-varying disturbances can be rejected effectively. The stability of the proposed control scheme is proved. Finally, a set of comparative experiments between the proposed controller and the classic STA-based method have been carried out based on a three-level NPC converter prototype, and the results confirmed the efficacy of the proposed control strategy.</description></item><item><title>An Adaptive 56-Gb/s Duo-PAM4 Detector Using Reduced Branch Maximum Likelihood Sequence Detection in a 28-nm CMOS Wireline Receiver</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10683722</link><description>This paper describes an adaptive duo-binary four-level pulse amplitude modulation (Duo-PAM4) detector that significantly reduces the bit error rate (BER) of the conventional wireline transceivers under high insertion loss (IL) channels. The parallel maximum likelihood sequence detection (MLSD) combined with parallel feed-forward equalization (FFE) is proposed to generate, equalize, and detect Duo-PAM4 signals, thus reducing BER compared to conventional decision feedback equalizer (DFE) and slicers. The proposed reduced branch MLSD reduces power consumption compared to MLSD. An improved delay zero-forcing algorithm for Duo-PAM4 is proposed to achieve fast convergence of the FFE tap coefficients, reducing convergence time by up to 72.5% compared to conventional ZF algorithms for Duo-PAM4. Both the proposed and conventional detectors are implemented in a 28-nm CMOS process at 56 Gb/s and 38-dB insertion loss. The FFE+MLSD and FFE+RB-MLSD reduce the BER by two orders of magnitude compared to conventional FFE+DFE+slicer. The RB-MLSD reduces power consumption by 21.1% compared to conventional MLSD. The detector can be easily migrated to 112Gb/s or 224Gb/s transceivers.</description></item><item><title>A &#8722;79 dBm 7.56 nW 433 MHz Wake-Up Receiver With Interference Suppression for IoT Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10807458</link><description>In this paper, we present an ultra-low power wake-up receiver (WuRX) with effective interference suppression capability. A specific robust design has been implemented to address the common interference issues in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency band. A mathematical expression is derived in this paper for the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required by the comparator at which a envelope detector first (ED-first) WuRX can detect the wake-up message in the presence of interference. Aiming to meet the minimum SNR requirements, a quasi-direct coupling (QDC) baseband buffer scheme is proposed. Compared to the output SNR of traditional AC schemes, the QDC baseband buffer scheme achieves a 4.16 dB increase in output SNR under optimal conditions. To solve the problem where traditional comparator calibration schemes require recovery time after sudden disappearance of interference, the multipath signal detection (MPSD) scheme proposed in this paper can immediately detect information following the disappearance of interference, which improves detection efficiency. The WuRX is manufactured in 65nm LP process, consuming 7.56nW at a 0.4V power supply, with a sensitivity of &#8722;79dBm in the 433MHz ISM band. Under continuous wave (CW) interference, the receiver achieves a signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of &#8722;31dB at a frequency offset of 1MHz.</description></item><item><title>Power Losses Optimization of MMCs Based on Quantum Genetic Algorithm for HVdc Transmission Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10750512</link><description>Modular multilevel converters (MMCs) obtain widespread utilization in high-voltage direct current (HVdc) applications scenarios. The cost of power losses plays a significant part in MMC&#8217;s operating costs. Hence, this article proposes a quantum genetic algorithm-based power losses optimization control (QGA-PLOC). By comprehensively considering the power losses of the MMC, the quantum genetic algorithm determines the first-best value of the injected second circulating current magnitude and phase angle in the arm, as well as the optimal MMC power losses under given conditions. The quantum genetic algorithm incorporates the quantum state vector representation into genetic encoding and utilizes quantum logic gates for chromosome evolution, greatly improving the algorithm&#8217;s performance and significantly enhancing its computational efficiency and global optimization capability. Moreover, introducing the quantum genetic algorithm into the field of MMC power losses optimization offers a new path to address the acquisition of the optimal circulating current reference value in power loss optimization problems. MMC Simulation and experiment are also conducted, and the research results verify the effectiveness of the proposed QGA-PLOC for MMCs.</description></item><item><title>Transient Stability Enhancement Control for Virtual Synchronous Generator Controlled Isolated Power Grid</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10713298</link><description>Virtual synchronous generator (VSG) controlled isolated power grid has been widely concerned because of its advantages of voltage support. However, in the presence of significant disturbance, the system would face the risk of transient instability like conventional power grid. As a recently developed control method, phase sequence exchange (PSE) can not only stabilize the system but also avoid additional reduction in system capacity and inertia. Nonetheless, PSE increases redundant power electronic devices into the grid. Therefore, this paper establishes a transient model for VSG-controlled isolated power grid initially. Based on this, a control method is proposed to realize the effect of PSE by reducing the power angle of VSG through power electronic control in the inverter, named as virtual phase sequence exchange (VPSE). This control method effectively avoids the need for external PSE devices while improving the transient stability. Furthermore, this paper investigates the VPSE technology through the extended equal area criterion (EEAC) and modern control theory, with results indicating that compared to PSE, VPSE has better transient control effects. Finally, the proposed scheme is verified by physical experiments on the real-time digital simulation platform (RTDS).</description></item><item><title>Small Signal Modeling of a Four-Level Flying Capacitor Multilevel Totem-Pole PFC Converter</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10790883</link><description>In this paper, the small signal model for a four-level flying capacitor multilevel (FCML) totem-pole PFC converter is presented. In contrast to conventional PFC converters, the state space equations for the FCML PFC converter in a complete switching cycle change over the line cycle. If the standard state space averaging technique is applied, it will only evaluate a single combination of state space equations corresponding to only one segment of the line cycle. Since the four-level FCML PFC converter consists of three different segments in one half-line cycle, this technique is not applicable to derive a comprehensive small signal model of the converter that is required for regulation and transient stability. Moreover, the effects of flying capacitors on the FCML PFC dynamics are nulled out using the average model due to their natural balancing capability. In this work, the Fourier analysis of time-interval modulated switched network is used to determine the closed form small-signal control to output frequency response and verify its accuracy with the experimental results. The dynamic characteristic of the FCML converter is also evaluated for the variations in the converter passive elements. Finally, a hardware prototype is designed, fabricated, and tested for ac input 120 Vac, 400-V dc output, and 1-kW power rating demonstrating peak efficiency of 98.48%, power factor 0.995 and THD of 4.26% to observe the system behavior under load step changes.</description></item><item><title>A Privacy-Preserving Federated Reinforcement Learning Method for Multiple Virtual Power Plants Scheduling</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10736008</link><description>The application of federated learning in Virtual Power Plants (VPPs) addresses the data silo issue between VPPs and enhances their ability to cope with nonlinear and stochastic scheduling characteristics, which enables VPPs better accommodate distributed energy resources and flexible loads while participating in frequency regulation services. However, although existing federated learning methods strive to solve privacy protection issues, the plaintext transmission of gradients still exposes sensitive data to the threat of curious power control centers and external inference attacks. Therefore, a privacy-protected horizontal federated reinforcement learning approach for multi-VPP optimal scheduling is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a cost-based global optimization scheduling model for multiple VPPs is constructed, modeling the internal scheduling process of VPPs as a Markov decision process. Then, an improved secure horizontal federated multi-VPP collaborative training method is presented, and local models are trained using the Deep Transformer Q-Network algorithm, with local differential privacy and CKKS homomorphic encryption implemented to ensure privacy protection. Finally, a case study is conducted using frequency regulation ancillary service market data and the IEEE-39 bus system structure. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms similar algorithms, achieving high levels of privacy protection and economic operation for VPPs.</description></item><item><title>Structure-Reconfigurable Wide Gain Series Resonant Converter for On-Board Charger</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10931150</link><description>In this article, a structure-reconfigurable series resonant DC-DC converter is proposed for a wide gain on-board charger application. The proposed converter consists of a dual-bridge structure on the primary side which can realize 0.5 to 1 voltage gain by using a reconfigurable half/full bridge structure, and a hybrid rectifier on the secondary side which can realize 1 to infinite voltage gain by replacing two diodes with active switches. Moreover, the proposed converter employs a control scheme based on fixed frequency PWM, with the operating frequency being identical to the series resonant frequency. Accordingly, magnetizing inductance of the transformer is independent of the converter gain characteristics, which simplifies the consideration of the resonance parameters design. In addition, soft switching can be realized during the entire charging process, and high efficiency can be achieved. To avoid the voltage spike and current impact in the transition between two operation modes, a unified switching modulation strategy is applied to achieve a smooth transition and improve the control stability. Finally, a 2.5 kW prototype with an output voltage range of 200V - 500 V is established and tested to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed converter.</description></item><item><title>Modeling, Analysis, and Design of Phase Synchronization Loop for BIPT System Considering Operating Point Parameters Variation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10705342</link><description>In bidirectional inductive power transfer (BIPT) systems, phase synchronization loop that keeps the secondary-side excitation voltage synchronized with the current is essential for stable power transmission. However, the characteristic of control object in the synchronization loop can vary due to the variation of the operating point parameters (OPPs), which can lead to loop instability. In this article, the transfer functions of the control object and the phase detector in the phase synchronization loop are derived. The influence of the variation of OPPs on the transfer function of the control object is analyzed. The transfer function is mainly affected by one zero that is sensitive to the OPPs and can shift into low-frequency region, while the other poles and zeros are at high frequencies and have less influence. The phase synchronization controller is designed considering the variation of OPPs to ensure the stability of the system in a wide range of OPPs. The sensitivity of the loop to the OPPs is analyzed. Frequency response results from simulation and experiment have verified the correctness of the model, and the stability of the loop. Steady-state and transient experiments prove the stable steady-state performance and fast transient response of the system.</description></item><item><title>An All-Digital Spread-Spectrum Clock Generator With Feedforward Gain Calibration for LPWAN Chirp Transmission System</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10877936</link><description>In this brief, an all-digital spread-spectrum clock generator (AD-SSCG) is presented for low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) chirp spread spectrum application.

Employed with the combination of a constant slope digital-to-time converter (CS-DTC) and an multi-bit mid-rise TDC, the embedded digital loop can provide a linear sawtooth chirp modulation while keeping a good phase noise (PN) performance. Fabricated in a 40nm CMOS process, the AD-SSCG achieves a random jitter of 508fs $_{rms}$ , with measured PN of &#8722;111.6dBc/Hz@1MHz. The EMI reduction achieves 39.1dB (4MHz + 2000ppm depth).

The measured Doherty PA realizes a peak small-signal gain of 15.3 dB with 17 GHz 3-dB bandwidth. At 140 GHz, the PA achieves 16.1 dBm saturated output power (Psat) with peak power-added-efficiency (PAE) of 7% and 3% PAE at 6-dB power back-off (PBO) from Psat. To the authors&#8217; best knowledge, this is the first D-band CMOS integrated PA with high PBO efficiency.</description></item><item><title>An 8-to-12-Bit Resolution-Reconfigurable SAR ADC With Fast-Window-Switching Technique</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10883349</link><description>This brief presents a resolution-reconfigurable successive-approximation-register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC). The reconfigurable capacitor digital-to-analog converter (CDAC) is designed to support 8/10/12-bit resolution modes. In order to mitigate the nonlinearity introduced by capacitor mismatch and suppress the transition glitch during the most significant bit trial in 10/12-bit modes, the Fast-Window-Switching (FWS) technique is proposed. The FWS technique can improve the linearity of the ADC without increasing the total capacitance of the CDAC, thus reducing the chip area and the burden of input buffers. The prototype is fabricated in a 180-nm CMOS process and occupies an active area of 0.23mm2. On the condition of a sampling rate of 10-MS/s, the achieved SNDR and SFDR are 48.3dB and 60.8dB in the 8-bit mode. With the FWS performing its role in the 10/12-bit mode, the ADC achieves 59.2dB/65.5dB SNDR and 73.4dB/79.6dB SFDR, and consumes  $350\mu $ W/ $580\mu $ W at 1.8V supply.</description></item><item><title>A Compact RF Module With Hybrid Stacked Transformer and Integrated Transceiver Switch in 65 nm CMOS Technology</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10884979</link><description>In this brief, we propose an RF module that integrates a Doherty power amplifier (PA), a low noise amplifier (LNA), and a transceiver (TRX) switch. This configuration enables transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) mode conversion using a single MOSFET as a switch and a hybrid stacked transformer (HSTF) that covers just 0.0182 mm2. The HSTF co-designs the output matching network (OMN) of the Doherty PA and the input matching network (IMN) of the LNA, thereby reducing insertion loss and significantly miniaturizing the RF front-end. The introduction of an adjustable capacitor bank helps in regulating the parasitic capacitance generated by different operating modes in the HSTF. The 35&#8211;41 GHz TRX front-end is implemented in a 65 nm CMOS (1P9M) process. In the TX mode, the high saturated output power (Psat), 1-dB output compression point (OP1dB) and peak power added efficiency (PAE) are measured as 18.6 dBm, 17.7 dBm, and 25.8% at 38 GHz, respectively. The measured PAE at 6-dB and 9-dB power back-off (PBO) efficiency are 18.3% and 13.7%, resulting in efficiency enhancement ratios of 1.46 and 1.51 when compared with an ideal class-B PA. In the RX mode, the minimum noise figure (NF) is 4.8 dB at 38 GHz. The overall chip size of the TRX, including the three-stage PA/LNA and I/O pads, is approximately  $1.34\times 0.98$  mm2.</description></item><item><title>Single-Ended Back-Bias Voltage Generator Using One Pumping Capacitor</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887252</link><description>As the dynamic random-access memory technology advances, the size of storage capacitors has diminished. This trend has been accompanied by the challenge of reading cell data reliably from the storage capacitor. One of the most common approaches to solving this problem is preserving stored data by suppressing the sub-threshold leakage current in the access transistors with a negative body bias with a back-bias voltage (VBB) generator. This brief introduces a single-ended VBB generator using only one pumping capacitor. Conventional VBB generators with single-ended structures have a threshold voltage loss and unwanted charge-sharing at internal nodes and load outputs, causing performance degradation. The proposed circuit addresses these issues by employing a grounded gate inverter and an n-channel metal-oxide semiconductor transistor as a discharge transistor. This novel configuration can generate a negative voltage up to the supply voltage level with only one pumping capacitor with merits of power and size.

However, these systems are highly sensitive to variations in the oxygen-excess ratio (OER), which directly impacts their efficiency and lifespan. Controlling the OER presents significant challenges due to the system&#8217;s inherent nonlinearities, model uncertainties, and susceptibility to external disturbances. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive dynamic surface control with a disturbance observer (ADSCDOB) method to mitigate adverse effects and enhance control accuracy. The disturbance observer is designed using a nonlinear approach to effectively estimate uncertainties and external disturbances. The ADSCDOB method integrates adaptive dynamic surface control technology, enabling robust control while overcoming the &#8220;explosion of complexity&#8221; problem typical of traditional backstepping methods. The stability of the closed-loop system is rigorously established through theoretical analysis. Simulations validate the effectiveness of the ADSCDOB method, demonstrating its rapid response, minimal error, and robust stability across various operating conditions.</description></item><item><title>Distributed Closed-Loop Reference Adaptive Learning Control for Parallel Mutual Inductance Circuits</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879297</link><description>Parallel mutual inductance circuits (PMICs) are fundamental components of levitation control systems in maglev transportation, which are controlled to regulate levitation gaps.

The communication between the reduced-order filters and the systems is transmitted through the network. On the one hand, quantization is considered to save network resources; on the other hand, due to the measurement may not be perfect, the system information is a hidden component (i.e., it possesses inaccessibility), therefore reduced-order filters are designed by using the hidden Markov model. Then, the random stability of the plant is guaranteed by a set of conditions derived according to Lyapunov theory. Subsequently, the gains of the designed filters are obtained through decoupling. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach in this brief is confirmed by utilizing a pulse-width-modulation-driven boost converter.</description></item><item><title>Low-Cost Yet Effective Trojan Mitigation Techniques for Approximate Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10859259</link><description>Approximate Computing (AC) is a promising computing paradigm that provides efficiency and speed while maintaining acceptable accuracy in error-tolerant applications. However, most of the existing AC designs are prone to Hardware Trojan (HT) attacks. Moreover, the existing HT mitigation techniques have been designed for exact systems and due to the architectural differences in the approximate systems, these conventional mitigation techniques have limited efficacy when used in the context of AC. Therefore, this brief presents two novel methods, named Partial Comparison (PC) and Hybrid Comparison (HC), that effectively mitigate HTs in approximate systems while achieving a 30% and 55% improvement in the area and the power efficiency, compared to the existing state-of-the-art technique. PC focuses on LSBs while HC considers both LSBs and MSBs for HT masking. The effectiveness of proposed techniques is validated through a practical case study of image processing; three IPs with different HTs are successfully masked with a PSNR and SSIM of 33dB and 0.92 respectively. In conclusion, this research provides practical solution to enhance security and reliability of approximate systems with optimal performance benefits.</description></item><item><title>BeaCIM: A Digital Compute-in-Memory DNN Processor With Bi-Directional Exponent Alignment for FP8 Training</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10879560</link><description>Previous digital Compute-In-Memory (DCIM) exhibits limitations in Deep Neural Network (DNN) training with FP8, which is playing an increasingly important role in model training. Most of the previous DCIM purely align exponents to the maximum one when computing floating-point data. This method struggles to balance accuracy and energy efficiency when using FP8. In this brief, we propose BeaCIM, a DCIM processor with bi-directional exponent alignment. There are several contributions.

Finally, we performed RTL-level circuit implementation and evaluated BeaCIM using various datasets and models. Our experiments show the following results: (1) Compared with the standard hybrid FP8 training, our bi-directional exponent alignment FP8 training exhibits an average top-1 accuracy drop less than 0.75% across different models and datasets. (2) BeaCIM can achieve an energy efficiency of 31.5 TFLOPS/W at FP8, which is 2.6- $19.3\times $  better than state-of-the-art works.</description></item><item><title>A 1.46-pJ/bit, 149-KF&#178; RO TRNG Based on Reference-RO-Free Thresholding of Jitter Accumulation</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10892238</link><description>In this brief, a ring-oscillator-based true random number generator (RO-TRNG) is presented with an energy-efficient on-chip module for temporal thresholding of the accumulated jitter noise. The need of power-hungry reference ring oscillator (RO) for frequency collapse detection in previous implementation can be completely removed. In addition, by setting the RO-TRNG&#8217;s enable signal adaptively according to the output of the proposed jitter accumulation thresholding (JAT) module, the redundant oscillations in most cycles of the prior art can be fully eliminated, leading to significant energy saving per each TRNG bit. Based on a 65-nm 1.2 V standard CMOS process, the fabricated TRNG chips feature an ultra-compact silicon area of 149 K $F^{2}$ . Meanwhile, a high energy efficiency of 1.46 pJ/bit is achieved for the prototype chips operated under a supply voltage of 1.0 V and an overall throughput of 44.7 Mbps. High randomness of the fabricated TRNG chips is well validated by using both National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and autocorrelation function (ACF) test tools. Moreover, high Shannon entropy values over 0.999998 are observed for the TRNG chips operated under an industrial temperature range of &#8722;40&#176;C~125&#176;C and a supply voltage range of 1.0 V~1.4 V, showing excellent tolerance to the process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations.</description></item><item><title>PIMSR: An Energy-Efficient Processing-in-Memory Accelerator for 60 FPS 4K Super-Resolution</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10902411</link><description>Due to the huge computational load, CNN-based super-resolution solutions are hard to be deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. In this brief, we proposed a Processing-in-Memory based SR accelerator (PIMSR) that leverages direct simple memory access operations to supersede intensive multiply-add in convolution operators, thus fundamentally improving the energy efficiency. To address the storage explosion problem, we presented an index reparameterized strategy for shrinking the memory requirement of LUT-based PIMSR framework by  $19.58\times $ . Furthermore, an address remapping design is putted forward to solve the access conflict in overlap configuration, which greatly boosts the efficiency of memory access. The prototype validation on low-end XC7A200T FPGA indicates that our design yields a new record of energy efficiency up to 671.61 Mpixels/J, over  $5.36\times $  higher than existing deep learning based image processors, with extremely low hardware costs.</description></item><item><title>A Power Self-Sufficient Managed Energy Harvester With Dual-Source Synergistic Cold-Start Capability</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10874147</link><description>This brief presents a power self-sufficient managed dual-source energy harvester that prioritizes the harvested energy for self-consumption and then transfers the surplus energy to the load or storage, thereby avoiding paying more than harvesting when the environmental energy is weak. The bipolar stacking structure employed enables the simultaneous harvesting of both energy sources through time-division multiplexing in DCM or synchronized extraction in CCM. Additionally, this structure allows the dual sources to share a single cold starter, while also facilitating low-voltage startup. The proposed harvester, fabricated using a  $0.18~\mu $ m CMOS process, achieves end-to-end peak efficiencies of 84.3% and 82.5% for photovoltaic and thermoelectric energy harvesting, respectively, while achieving a dual-source synergistic cold-start voltage as low as 80 mV.</description></item><item><title>Minimum Unit Capacitance Calculation for Capacitor Arrays in Binary-Weighted and Split DACs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10716014</link><description>The layout area and power consumption of a charge-scaling digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is typically dominated by the capacitor array. For a binary-weighted DAC, since the number of unit capacitors in the array increases exponentially with the number of bits, minimizing the size of the unit capacitor is crucial for controlling the layout area. A split DAC uses many fewer unit capacitors than the binary-weighted DAC, but requires the use of noninteger multiples of a unit capacitance; the choice of unit capacitor remains an important consideration. Smaller capacitors can be susceptible to larger amounts of noise and process mismatch, and can also be affected by mismatch in the parasitics of routing wires that connect the capacitors in the array: the latter is particularly significant in FinFET nodes. Together, these factors can degrade critical DAC performance metrics unless the unit capacitor is sufficiently large. This work proposes a systematic approach for selecting the unit capacitance value in both binary-weighted and split capacitor arrays for charge-scaling DACs. The proposed method selects a value that optimizes the nonlinearity metrics of a DAC, accounting for multiple factors that contribute to mismatch, flicker noise, and thermal noise. Our results demonstrate that by using a systematic methodology to size the unit capacitor, it is possible to overcome shifts due to process variation and noise for 6-bit to 14-bit DACs. Particularly for higher-resolution DACs, it is seen that the minimum unit capacitor value for binary-weighted DACs is lower than for split DACs, but the former incurs much larger area costs since it contains a significantly larger number of unit capacitors.</description></item><item><title>On-Device Training of Fully Quantized Deep Neural Networks on Cortex-M Microcontrollers</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10726519</link><description>On-device training of deep neural networks (DNNs) allows models to adapt and fine tune to newly collected data or changing domains while deployed on microcontroller units (MCUs). However, DNN training is a resource-intensive task, making the implementation and execution of DNN training algorithms on MCUs challenging due to low processor speeds, constrained throughput, limited floating-point support, and memory constraints. In this work, we explore on-device training DNNs for different sized Cortex-M MCUs (Cortex-M0+, Cortex-M4, and Cortex-M7). We present a method that enables efficient training of DNNs completely in place on the MCU using fully quantized training (FQT) and dynamic partial gradient updates. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on multiple vision and time-series datasets and provide insights into the tradeoff between training accuracy, memory overhead, energy, and latency on real hardware. The results show that compared to related work, our approach requires 34.8% less memory and has a 49.0% lower latency per training sample, with dynamic partial gradient updates allowing a speedup of up to 8.7 compared to fully updating all weights.</description></item><item><title>A Q-Learning-Based Display Energy Optimization Scheme for Android Systems</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10734375</link><description>Mobile devices have gained immense popularity in recent years and have become an integral part of people&#8217;s daily lives. This surge in usage presents new challenges for energy conservation, particularly concerning the screens of mobile phones. Not only are screens being used for longer durations, but also their adjustment needs to be dynamically conducted during runtime. Existing approaches for display energy optimization mainly focus on the display content while disregarding user interactions. This limitation prevents the full exploitation of opportunities to reduce screen energy consumption during runtime. Detection-based display energy optimization approaches incorporate user interactions to some extent. However, these approaches require additional hardware and offer relatively coarse-grained control. To address these challenges, we propose QLEO, a Q-learning-based runtime display energy optimization scheme for Android systems. QLEO takes both the display and user interaction features into account. By dynamically classifying the user state into active and idle states based on these features, we enable adaptive screen brightness adjustments according to the user&#8217;s current state. We formulate display energy optimization as a constrained dynamic optimization problem and propose an integrated Q-learning model to effectively solve it. QLEO is designed as a module within the hardware abstraction layer, capable of obtaining display and user interaction features from the upper Android framework, and directly controlling the screen brightness through the underlying Linux kernel. We have implemented QLEO on real hardware and released the source code for public access. The experimental results demonstrate that QLEO achieves significant energy reduction without compromising the user experience.</description></item><item><title>An Efficient Branch-and-Bound Routing Optimization Method for Optical NoCs</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10729843</link><description>Silicon photonics-based optical networks-on-chip (ONoCs) are emerging as a power-efficient on-chip communication architecture for the next generation of chip multiprocessors. However, the thermal sensitivity of photonic devices presents power consumption challenges. Existing routing schemes optimized for optical power loss tend to avoid passing through high-temperature nodes, which in turn leads to contention at low-temperature nodes. It remains a crucial challenge to develop an adaptive routing algorithm that strikes a balance between the power consumption optimization and performance optimization. In this work, we first propose an efficient branch-and-bound routing (BBR) optimization method for ONoCs. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that the branch-and-bound (BB) method is adopted to solve the routing optimization problem in ONoCs. We further developed three variants of the BBR optimization method: 1) BBTR; 2) BBCR; and 3) 3BOR. Among them, 3BOR employs a bi-objective bounding function to optimize both optical power loss and network performance, while enhancing algorithmic efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the state-of-the-art heuristic contention-aware thermal-reliable routing algorithm, 3BOR reduces the thermal-induced optical power loss by 15.6% while reducing the algorithm running time by 82.2%.</description></item><item><title>OPASCA: Outer Product-Based Accelerator With Unified Architecture for Sparse Convolution and Attention</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10720832</link><description>Vision transformer (ViT)-based models have achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in many computer vision tasks, but their attention mechanism is more computation and communication intensive than convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To adapt ViT-based models for resource-constrained edge computing platforms, techniques, such as network sparsity and convolution-attention combination, have been proposed to reduce processing costs without compromising accuracy. Therefore, specific hardware designs able to handle sparsity in both convolution and attention operations are required to accelerate the processing speed. In view of this, this work proposes OPASCA, an accelerator featuring a unified hardware architecture that supports irregular activation and weight sparsity in both operations. Specifically, this target is achieved with the following contributions: 1) we employ outer product dataflow to efficiently handle sparse weights and input neurons, supporting both convolution and attention computing with minimal hardware overhead; 2) we design a hierarchical butterfly network to route the output neurons to the accumulation buffers, minimizing the conflicts among outer product results and reducing the hardware overhead of accumulation banks; and 3) we propose a novel encoding scheme that achieves more compact sparse inputs and enhances multiplier utilization. Evaluations on VGG-16, ViT, BoTNet, and Conformer models show that OPASCA outperforms state-of-the-art accelerators by  $1.60 \times -2.08 \times $  on sparse convolution tasks and by  $1.18 \times -1.70 \times $  on sparse attention tasks in term of performance. It also reduces DRAM access to 19%&#8211;86% and energy consumption to 36%&#8211;92% of those of the counterpart designs.</description></item><item><title>MC-QDSNN: Quantized Deep Evolutionary SNN With Multidendritic Compartment Neurons for Stress Detection Using Physiological Signals</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10726630</link><description>Long short-term memory (LSTM) has emerged as a definitive network model for analyzing and inferring time series data since their introduction. LSTM has the capability to not only extract spectral features similar to convolutional-neural-network (CNN) models but also a mixture of temporal features. Due to this distinguished advantage, similar feature extraction method is explored for the spiking counterpart of the neural network, targeted for time-series data. Though LSTMs perform well in the spiking form of neural network, they tend to be compute and power intensive. Addressing this issue, the work proposes multicompartment leaky (MCLeaky) neuron as a viable alternative for efficient processing of time series data. The MCLeaky neuron, introduced as a derivative of the leaky integrate and fire (LIF) neuron model, contains multiple memristive synapses interlinked to form the memory component of the neuron, by emulating Hippocampus&#8217; structure of brain as reference. The proposed MCLeaky neuron-based spiking neural network (SNN) model and its quantized variant were benchmarked against state-of-the-art (SOTA) spiking LSTMs to perform human stress detection by comparing computing requirements, compute-latency, and real-world performances on freshly acquired unseen data with models that is acquired by employing neural architecture search (NAS). Results show that the networks with MCLeaky activation neuron managed a superior accuracy of 98.8% to detect stress based on electrodermal activity (EDA) signals, better than any other investigated model, while using 20% less parameters on average. MCLeaky neuron was also investigated for different modality of signals, including EDA Wrist, EDA Chest, Temperature, electrocardiogram signal, and combination of them. Quantized MCLeaky model was also derived and validated to forecast their performance on hardware aware architecture, which resulted in 91.84% accuracy. The neurons were evaluated for multiple modalities of data toward stress detection, which resulted in energy savings of  $25.12\times - 39.20\times $  and EDP gains of  $52.37\times - 81.9\times $  over the artificial neural network model, besides offering the best accuracy of 98.8% when compared with the remainder of the SOTA implementations.</description></item><item><title>MCSSA: A Stream-Based Multiconcurrency Systolic Sorting Array Combining Merge Tree</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10700998</link><description>The exploration of utilizing reconfigurable circuits with parallel computing capabilities has been conducted to enhance sorting performance and reduce power consumption. However, most sorting algorithms using dedicated processors are based on parallelization designs of serial algorithms without considering the design method of large-scale integrated circuits. This results in various issues, including the overuse of  $I/O$  interface resources, on-chip storage resources, and complex layout wiring. In this article, we extend the 2-tuple relation in the uniform recurrence equation (URE) structure used to define the systolic array to n-tuples, and the extended structure is flexible in defining  $I/O$  bandwidth and concurrency. Then we define the multiconcurrency systolic sorter array (MCSSA) algorithm based on the extended URE structure, which has a flexible  $4N/n$  time complexity based on the n-tuple relation. Moreover, this systolic array can simultaneously sort two independent sequences, increasing the reuse of resources. Afterwards, we encapsulate each n-tuple into a processing element (PE) cell. The entire MCSSA consists of these interconnected PE cells, each of which can be customized in terms of data bit width and type. Last but not least, we have improved the merge tree structure called MC-merge tree. The concurrency of this algorithm can also be flexibly defined, we use this algorithm combined with MCSSA to cope with large-scale sorting scenarios. In our experiments, we have demonstrated the speed-up ratio of MCSSA relative to other state of the art (SOTA) sorting algorithms. Inheriting the unity and simplicity from the Systolic Array architecture, MCSSA achieves a maximum  $73.17\times $  acceleration ratio on the U200. In addition, the MC-merge tree expands the MCSSA sorting scale with a maximum of 450.56 times while maintaining the advantage of the acceleration ratio. The results of our study demonstrate that MCSSA and MC-merge tree have better acceleration, throughput and scalability advantages over other SOTA algorithms.</description></item><item><title>System-Level Design Space Exploration for High-Level Synthesis Under End-to-End Latency Constraints</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10701001</link><description>Many modern embedded systems have end-to-end (EtoE) latency constraints that necessitate precise timing to ensure high reliability and functional correctness. The combination of high-level synthesis (HLS) and design space exploration (DSE) enables the rapid generation of embedded systems using various constraints/directives to find Pareto-optimal configurations. Current HLS DSE approaches often address latency by focusing on individual components, without considering the EtoE latency during the system-level optimization process. However, to truly optimize the system under EtoE latency, we need a holistic approach that analyzes individual system components&#8217; timing constraints in the context of how the different components interact and impact the overall design. This article presents a novel system-level HLS DSE approach, called EtoE-DSE, that accommodates EtoE latency and variable timing constraints for complex multicomponent application-specific embedded systems. EtoE-DSE employs a latency estimation model and a pathfinding algorithm to identify and estimate the EtoE latency for paths between any endpoints. It also uses a frequency-based segmentation process to segment and prune the design space, alongside a latency-constrained optimization algorithm for efficiently and accurately exploring the system-level design space. We evaluate our approach using a real-world use case of an autonomous driving subsystem compared to the state-of-the-art in HLS DSE. We show that our approach yields substantially better-optimization results than prior DSE approaches, improving the quality of results by up to 89.26%, while efficiently identifying Pareto-optimal configurations in terms of energy and area.</description></item><item><title>Multiobjective Optimization in Logic Synthesis Based on TB-RM Dual Logic</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10729855</link><description>Traditional logic synthesis methods are based on Boolean logic, which tends to produce redundant logic structures in dense circuit applications, such as complex number operations and error detection/correction coding. Traditional Boolean and Reed-Muller (TB-RM) logic synthesis method combining traditional Boolean (TB) logic and Reed-Muller (RM) logic can improve comprehensive optimization indexes and reduce cost. The existing TB design method is not effective when dealing with constrained systems with high-resource utilization requirements. In addition, traditional synthesis methods do not consider multiobjective optimization of area, power consumption and reliability. To solve these problems, we propose an effective dual logic synthesis method (EDSM), which includes dual logic detection method (DDM) and differential evolution algorithm based on multidimensional mutation strategy (DE-MMS). DDM can complete the logic detection function, and DE-MMS can further optimize the polarity. In addition, to evaluate the soft errors occurring more efficiently at the logic level, we propose a soft error rate (SER) estimation model. Experimental results show that compared with state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms, EDSM can search for optimal solutions in all optimization problems; compared with commonly used TB-based minimization methods, EDSM has obvious advantages in multiobjective optimization of area, power consumption and SER. After 6-LUT FPGA technology and standard cells mapping, by selecting area as the optimal cost implementation, we obtain average improvements in the area of 14% and 2%, respectively.</description></item><item><title>TSLA: A Task-Specific Learning Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation on Autonomous Vehicles Platform</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10742128</link><description>Autonomous driving platforms encounter diverse driving scenarios, each with varying hardware resources and precision requirements. Given the computational limitations of embedded devices, it is crucial to consider computing costs when deploying on target platforms like the DRIVE PX 2. Our objective is to customize the semantic segmentation network according to the computing power and specific scenarios of autonomous driving hardware. We implement dynamic adaptability through a three-tier control mechanism&#8212;width multiplier, classifier depth, and classifier kernel&#8212;allowing fine-grained control over model components based on hardware constraints and task requirements. This adaptability facilitates broad model scaling, targeted refinement of the final layers, and scenario-specific optimization of kernel sizes, leading to improved resource allocation and performance. Additionally, we leverage Bayesian Optimization with surrogate modeling to efficiently explore hyperparameter spaces under tight computational budgets. Our approach addresses scenario-specific and task-specific requirements through automatic parameter search, accommodating the unique computational complexity and accuracy needs of autonomous driving. It scales its multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) for task-specific learning adaptation (TSLA), resulting in alternative configurations tailored to diverse self-driving tasks. These TSLA customizations maximize computational capacity and model accuracy, optimizing hardware utilization.</description></item><item><title>Improving Transformer Inference Through Optimized Nonlinear Operations With Quantization-Approximation-Based Strategy</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10738457</link><description>Transformers have recently shown significant performance across various tasks, such as natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). However, the performance comes at the cost of large memory and computation overhead. Existing researches primarily focus on accelerating matrix multiplication (MatMul) through techniques like quantization and pruning, notably increasing the proportion of nonlinear operations in inference runtime. Meanwhile, previous approaches designed for nonlinear operations struggle with inefficient implementation as they are incapable of achieving both computation and memory efficiency. Additionally, these methods often require retraining or fine-tuning leading to substantial costs and inconveniences. To overcome these problems, we propose efficient implementation of nonlinear operations with quantization-approximation-based strategy. Through an in-depth analysis of the dataflow and data distribution of nonlinear operations, we design distinct quantization and approximation strategies tailored for different operations. Specifically, log2 quantization and power-of-two factor quantization have been employed in Softmax and LayerNorm, complemented by logarithmic function and low-precision statistic calculation as approximation strategies. Furthermore, the proposed efficient GeLU implementation integrates a nonuniform lookup procedure alongside low-bit-width quantization. Experimental results demonstrate negligible accuracy drops without the need for retraining or fine-tuning. By implementing the hardware design, it achieves  $3.14\times - 6.34\times $  energy-efficiency and  $3.01\times - 10.1\times $  area-efficiency improvements compared to state-of-the-art application-specific-integrated-circuit (ASIC) designs. In system-level evaluation, substantial speedup and reductions in energy consumption of 15% to 35% are achieved for end-to-end inference across both GPU and ASIC accelerator platforms.</description></item><item><title>pPIRW: An Efficient and Accurate Precalculation Path Integral Random Walk Solver for Steady-State Thermal Simulation With Robin Boundary Conditions</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10704731</link><description>With the rapid increase of the transistor number in VLSI, rapidly rising power density and temperatures make heat dissipation a major challenge in IC design and manufacturing. However, conventional deterministic thermal analysis methods have difficulties in obtaining local temperature solutions efficiently, and the existing stochastic method is inaccurate when dealing with thermal analysis problems involving Robin boundary conditions (BCs). In this article, a highly parallelized path integral random walk (PIRW) solver is innovatively proposed for steady-state thermal analysis with mixed BCs, especially Robin BCs. The rigorous calculation of the local time and the Feynman-Kac functional  $\hat {e}_{c}(t)$  are adopted to accurately handle Neumann and Robin BCs for the first time. Furthermore, based on the PIRW, we propose an accurate and microsecond-level precalculation PIRW (pPIRW) predictor, which precalculates time-consuming random walks, obtains temperatures by simple vector multiplication, and therefore is suitable for proactive thermal management. The pPIRW essentially calculates a partial inverse of large-scale matrices constructed from the finite difference-based compact thermal models (CTMs). Experimental results show that compared with 3D-ICE, the PIRW solver maintains high accuracy with a negligible error within  $0.5~^{\circ }$ C, achieves  $136\times $ &#8211; $209\times $  speedup and  $8.53\times $ &#8211; $11.1\times $  storage space reduction with all three kinds of BCs, and decreases to  $1\times $ &#8211; $1.53\times $  speedup for lacking the absorbing Dirichlet boundary. The pPIRW further has speed improvement of 2.5e $4\times $ &#8211;6.7e $6\times $  and memory reduction of  $36.6\times $ &#8211; $42.5\times $  over PIRW without loss of accuracy. Integrated within a thermal management strategy, the pPIRW predictor can eliminate all thermal conflicts while maintaining the highest working frequency. Meanwhile, pPIRW achieves  $29.2\times $  speedup and  $634\times $  memory reduction over the CTM during the offline precalculation stage.</description></item><item><title>Threshold Optimized DVR Model for RF Power Amplifier Using Particle Swarm Algorithm for 5G Application</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10729876</link><description>In this work, the thresholds of the decomposed vector rotation (DVR) model for radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers (PAs) which based on canonical piecewise linear (CPWL) function, has been analyzed and optimized.

The presence of the gate changes the avalanche generation location and alters the current path to form a new effective channel for the avalanche transport mode, so the characteristics of G-HEMATT can be modulated according to the gate location. Our simulations show that the G-HEMATT exhibits better characteristics in terms of operating frequency, conversion efficiency, and AC power. The presence of the gate creates and changes the length of the dead zone, thus modulating the effective channel of the avalanche-transit mode. Compared to the HEMATT in this article, the optimum frequency of the G-HEMATT rises from 360 to 480 GHz, the maximum AC output power rises from 1.96 to 4.61 W/mm, and the maximum conversion efficiency rises from 11.21% to 22.03%. It is also found that the existence of the gate structure allows the formation of the new conducting channel between the gate and the drain, but the gate voltage has no significant effect on the device performance. The results also show that the sheet concentration of the channel two-dimensional electron gas (2-DEG) has a large effect on the performance of G-HEMATT, it is essential to ensure that the sheet concentration is not too low in order to obtain a more effective improvement in device performance.</description></item><item><title>RV-SCNN: A RISC-V Processor With Customized Instruction Set for SNN and CNN Inference Acceleration on Edge Platforms</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10702560</link><description>The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) applications has driven an increasing demand for conducting inference tasks on edge devices. However, implementing computation-intensive neural networks on resource-constrained edge systems remains a significant challenge. In this article, we propose a novel processor architecture called RV-SCNN to address this challenge. The architecture is based on the RISC-V generic instruction set and incorporates various single instruction multiple data (SIMD) custom instruction extensions to accelerate the computation of spike neural networks (SNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enabling efficient execution of complex neural network models. The core operators of the processor are shared by both SNN and CNN operations, thus supporting both computation modes. Other acceleration implementations include an internal hardware loop control unit that reduces the instruction overhead, an address calculation unit and an interlayer fusion unit that minimize the memory access overhead, as well as an image to column (IM2COL) unit that improves the computational efficiency of the  $3 \times 3$  convolutions in SNNs and CNNs. The custom instructions are called through inline assembly in the C program, providing higher flexibility compared to traditional ASICs and supporting custom complex SNN/CNN network structures. Compared to traditional instruction sets, the RV-SCNN processor reduces the execution time of CNNs and SNNs by over 90%. We validate the processor on FPGA platform and evaluate its performance under CMOS 55-nm process. The processor achieves an operational efficiency of 9.88 pJ/SOP in SNN network inference tasks, while the peak energy efficiency reaches 679 GOPS/W in CNN network inference.</description></item><item><title>A Robust Test Architecture for Low-Power AI Accelerators</title><link>http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10711312</link><description>With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), there has been extensive research on AI accelerators to meet the demand for data-intensive analytics.

In this article, a low-cost quadruple-node-upset (QNU) self-recoverable latch based on cross-interlocking (Quad-CIRC) is proposed. By utilizing four cross-interlocking self-recoverable cells (CIRCs) for interlocking, complete QNU self-recovery is achieved with reduced sensitive nodes. Meanwhile, the majority of currently available QNU self-recoverable latches are primarily composed of C-elements-based redundancy, resulting in a significant increase in area overhead. However, Quad-CIRC effectively reduces area overhead while ensuring hardened capability through cross-interlocking of CIRCs. HSPICE-based simulations in 22 nm CMOS technology demonstrate that Quad-CIRC achieves a reduction of 69.08% on average of power consumption, an increase of 16.83% on average of delay, a reduction of 63.51% on average of power-delay-product (PDP), a reduction of 51.01% on average of area, a reduction of 83.44% on average of area-PDP (APDP), and an increase of 60.49% on average of critical charge, compared to five other QNU self-recoverable latches (QRHIL, MURLAV, LDAVPM,  $QR-R_{11}-C_{2}$ , and low-delay QNU self-recoverable).</description></item></channel></rss>
